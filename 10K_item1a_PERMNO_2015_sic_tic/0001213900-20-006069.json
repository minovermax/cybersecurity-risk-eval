{"cik": "1341766", "company": "Celsius Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business faces certain risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think as immaterial, may also impair our business. If any of the events anticipated by the risks described below or elsewhere in this report occur, our results of operations and financial conditions could be adversely affected.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses and we may experience additional losses in the futures.\nAlthough the Company generated net income available to common shareholder of $9,971,260, for the year ended December 31, 2019, there has been a history of losses, including net losses available to common shareholders of $11,419,781 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our future operating results will depend on many factors, both in and out of our control, including the ability to increase and sustain demand for and acceptance of our products, the level of our competition, and our ability to attract and maintain key management and key employees. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we can attain consistent profitability.\nWe rely on third party co-packers to manufacture our products. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our co-packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer.\nWe do not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsource such manufacturing to established third party co-packers. These third-party co-packers may not be able to fulfill our demand as it arises, could begin to charge rates that make using their services cost inefficient or may simply not be able to or willing to provide their services to us on a timely basis or at all. In the event of any disruption or delay, whether caused by a rift in our relationship or the inability of our co-packers to manufacture our products as required, we would need to secure the services of alternative co-packers. We may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period and any such transition could be costly. In such case, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe rely on distributors to distribute our products in the DSD sales channel and in international markets. If we are unable to secure such distributors and/or we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing distributors, our business could suffer.\nWe distribute Celsius\u00ae in the DSD sales channel by entering into agreements with direct-to-store delivery distributors having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations. We similarly are seeking to expand our international distribution, particularly in the Far East and elsewhere in Asia by entering into agreements with large established distributors who service those markets. Many of our distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other beverage products. In many cases, such products compete directly with our products. The marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. If Celsius\u00ae proves to be less attractive to our distributors and/or if we fail to attract distributors, and/or our distributors do not market and promote our products with greater focus in preference to the products of our competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur customers are material to our success. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing customers, our business could suffer.\nUnilateral decisions could be taken by our distributors, grocery chains, convenience chains, drug stores, nutrition stores, mass merchants, club warehouses and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer.\nIncreases in cost or shortages of raw materials or increases in costs of co-packing could harm our business.\nThe principal raw materials used by us are flavors and ingredient blends as well as aluminum cans, the prices of which are subject to fluctuations. We are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients we utilize will rise in the future and whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. We do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. In addition, some of these raw materials, such as our distinctive sleek 12 ounce can, are available from a single or a limited number of suppliers. As alternative sources of supply may not be available, any interruption in the supply of such raw materials might materially harm us.\nOur failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe may not correctly estimate demand for our products. If we materially underestimate demand for our products and are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis, in which case our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend upon our trademarks and proprietary rights, and any failure to protect our intellectual property rights or any claims that we are infringing upon the rights of others may adversely affect our competitive position.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights. We cannot be sure that trademarks will be issued with respect to any future trademark applications or that our competitors will not challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us.\nOur products are manufactured using our proprietary blends of ingredients. These blends are created by third-party suppliers to our specifications and then supplied to our co-packers. Although all of the third parties in our supply and manufacture chain execute confidentiality agreements, there can be no assurance that our trade secrets, including our proprietary ingredient blends will not become known to competitors.\nWe believe that our competitors, many of whom are more established and have greater financial and personnel resources than we do, may be able to replicate or reverse engineer our processes, brands, flavors, or our products in a manner that could circumvent our protective safeguards. Therefore, we cannot give you any assurance that our confidential business information will remain proprietary. Any such loss of confidentiality could diminish or eliminate any competitive advantage provided by our proprietary information.\nWe may incur material losses as a result of product recall and product liability.\nWe may be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death. We also may be required to recall some of our products if they become contaminated or are damaged or mislabeled. A significant product liability judgment against us, or a widespread product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The amount of the insurance we carry is limited, and that insurance is subject to certain exclusions and may or may not be adequate.\nOur lack of product diversification and inability to timely introduce new or alternative products could cause us to cease operations.\nOur business is centered on Celsius\u00ae and our recent product line extensions, including Celsius Heat\u2122. The risks associated with focusing on a limited product line are substantial. If consumers do not accept our products or if there is a general decline in market demand for, or any significant decrease in, the consumption of functional beverages, we are not financially or operationally capable of introducing alternative products within a short time frame. As a result, such lack of acceptance or market demand decline could cause us to cease operations.\nWe are dependent on our key executives and employees and the loss of any of their services could materially adversely affect us which may have a material adverse effect on our Company.\nOur future success will depend substantially upon the abilities of, and personal relationships developed by our key executives and employees. The sudden loss of the services of any key executive or employee could materially adversely affect our business and our prospects for the future. We do not have key person insurance on the lives of such individuals.\nWe are dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel.\nOur future success depends in part on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel. Competition for such personnel in the beverage industry is intense and we may not be able to retain our key managerial, sales and technical employees or attract and retain additional highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel in the future. Any inability to attract and retain the necessary technical, sales and managerial personnel could materially adversely affect us.\nThe FDA has not passed on the efficacy of our products or the accuracy of any claim we make related to our products.\nAlthough six independent clinical studies have been conducted relating to the calorie-burning and related effects of our products, the results of these studies have not been submitted to or reviewed by the FDA. Further, the FDA has not passed on the efficacy of any of our products nor has it reviewed or passed on any claims we make related to our products, including the claim that our products aid consumers in burning calories or enhancing their metabolism.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by natural catastrophes or public health crises, in the locations in which we, our distributors or our suppliers operate.\nA natural disaster could disrupt our operations, or our distributors\u2019 or suppliers\u2019 operations and delivery of products and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our international operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, which could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer. For example, since December 2019, an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus in Wuhan, China and elsewhere (including Europe) has resulted in travel disruption and has affected certain companies\u2019 operations. At this point, the extent to which the coronavirus may impact our results is uncertain. However, since we operate on a fixed royalty basis in China we do not currently expect the coronavirus to have a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Industry\nWe are subject to significant competition in the beverage industry.\nThe beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, distribution channel penetration, development of new products and flavors and marketing campaigns. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources and name recognition than we do.\nImportant factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of our products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting-edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. Our products compete with all liquid refreshments and with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers, such as The Coca Cola Company, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, PepsiCo, Inc., Nestle, Waters North America, Inc., Hansen Natural Corp. and Red Bull. We also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily local in operation. Our products also compete with private label brands such as those carried by supermarket chains, convenience store chains, drug store chains, mass merchants and club warehouses.\nThere can be no assurance that we will compete successfully in the functional beverage industry. The failure to do so would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe compete in an industry that is brand-conscious, so brand name recognition and acceptance of our products are critical to our success and significant marketing and advertising could be needed to achieve and sustain brand recognition.\nOur business is substantially dependent upon awareness and market acceptance of our products and brands by our targeted consumers. Our business depends on acceptance by our independent distributors of our brand as one that has the potential to provide incremental sales growth rather than reduce distributors\u2019 existing beverage sales. The development of brand awareness and market acceptance is likely to require significant marketing and advertising expenditures. There can be no assurance that Celsius\u00ae will achieve and maintain satisfactory levels of acceptance by independent distributors and retail consumers. Any failure of the Celsius\u00ae brand to maintain or increase acceptance or market penetration would likely have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur sales are affected by seasonality.\nAs is typical in the beverage industry, our sales are seasonal. Our highest sales volumes generally occur in the second and third quarters, which correspond to the warmer months of the year in our major markets. Consumer demand for our products is also affected by weather conditions. Cool, wet spring or summer weather could result in decreased sales of our beverages and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business is subject to many regulations and noncompliance is costly.\nThe production, marketing and sale of our beverage products are subject to the rules and regulations of various federal, state and local health agencies. The marketing and sale of our products internationally is similarly subject to compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations in those foreign countries where our products are sold. If a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or production may be stopped, thus adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, any adverse publicity associated with any noncompliance may damage our reputation and our ability to successfully market our products. Furthermore, the rules and regulations are subject to change from time to time and while we closely monitor developments in this area, we have no way of anticipating whether changes in these rules and regulations will impact our business adversely. Additional or revised regulatory requirements, whether labeling, environmental, tax or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks related to our recent acquisition of Func Food may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny acquisition, including the recently completed acquisition of Func Food, involves potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u25cf The validity of our assumptions about sales, revenues, operating expenses and costs;\n\u25cf Our ability to successfully integrate the acquisition; and\n\u25cf The assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or, where coverage is excluded or limited under the warranty and indemnity insurance policy.\nIf any of these risks were to materialize, the benefits of the Func Food acquisition may not be fully realized, if at all, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nRisk Factors Relating to our Status as a Fully Reporting Public Company\nWe are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) that require us to incur audit fees and legal fees in connection with the preparation of such reports. These additional costs could reduce or eliminate our ability to earn a profit.\nWe are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and as a result, we are now required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) pursuant to the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. In order to comply with these requirements, our independent registered public accounting firm has to review our financial statements on a quarterly basis and audit our financial statements on an annual basis. Moreover, our legal counsel has to review and assist in the preparation of such reports. The costs charged by these professionals for such services cannot be accurately predicted at this time because factors such as the number and type of transactions that we engage in and the complexity of our reports cannot be determined at this time and will have a major effect on the amount of time to be spent by our auditors and attorneys. However, the incurrence of such costs will obviously be an expense to our operations and thus have a negative effect on our ability to meet our overhead requirements and earn a profit. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock, if a market ever develops, could drop significantly.\nIf we do not maintain an effective internal control environment as well as adequate control procedures over our financial reporting, investor confidence may be adversely affected thereby affecting the value of our stock price\nWe are required to maintain proper internal control over our financial reporting and adequate controls related to our disclosures. As defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. If we fail to maintain adequate controls, our business, the results of operations, financial condition and/or the value of our stock may be adversely impacted.\nRisk Factors Related to our Common Stock\nWe cannot guarantee the continued existence of an active established public trading market for our common stock.\nOur common stock currently is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Trading in stock quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market may often experience wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance.\nMarket prices for our common stock may also be influenced by a number of other factors, including:\n\u25cf the issuance of new equity securities pursuant to a public or private offering;\n\u25cf changes in interest rates;\n\u25cf competitive developments, including announcements by competitors of new products or services or significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf change in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u25cf the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;\n\u25cf investor perceptions of Celsius and the functional beverage industry generally; and\n\u25cf general economic and other national conditions.\nOur board of directors has the authority, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with terms that may not be beneficial to common shareholders and with the ability to affect adversely shareholder voting power and perpetuate their control over us.\nOur Articles of Incorporation allows our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our shareholders. Our board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock.\nThe ability of our principal shareholders to control our business may limit or eliminate minority shareholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate affairs.\nOur principal shareholders own common stock and/or preferred stock which holds a majority of the voting power of our issued and outstanding capital. Accordingly, they will be able to effectively control the election of directors, as well as all other matters requiring shareholder approval. The interests of our principal shareholders may differ from the interests of other shareholders with respect to the issuance of shares, business transactions with or sales to other companies, selection of other directors and other business decisions. The minority shareholders have no way of overriding decisions made by our principal shareholders. This level of control may also have an adverse impact on the market value of our shares because our principal shareholders may institute or undertake transactions, policies or programs that result in losses, may not take any steps to increase our visibility in the financial community and / or may sell sufficient numbers of shares to significantly decrease our price per share.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock at any time in the foreseeable future. The future payment of dividends directly depends upon our future earnings, capital requirements, financial requirements and other factors that our board of directors will consider. Since we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock, return on your investment, if any, will depend solely on an increase, if any, in the market value of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 93263, "SIC": 2086, "TIC": "CELH"}
