RISK FACTORS\nThe following are the most material factors known to NTIC that could materially adversely affect its business, operating results, or financial condition.\nRisk Factors Summary\nThis summary is not complete and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth below.\nRisks Related to NTIC\u2019s Business and Industry\n\u25cf\nAny weakness in the global economy, and in particular in the United States, Europe, India and China, and in the automotive industry, may negatively impact NTIC\u2019s business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\u25cf\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and will likely continue to adversely impact NTIC\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\n\u25cf\nNTIC\u2019s business may be negatively impacted by inflation.\n\u25cf\nSupply chain disruptions could interrupt product manufacturing, increase product costs and result in lost sales, which may have a material adverse effect on NTIC\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\n\u25cf\nDisruptions to the distribution channels for NTIC\u2019s products may negatively impact NTIC\u2019s business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\u25cf\nNTIC\u2019s dependence on key suppliers puts NTIC at risk of interruptions in the availability of its products, which could reduce its net sales and adversely affect its operating results and harm its reputation.\n\u25cf\nIncreases in prices for raw materials and components used in NTIC\u2019s products could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s operating results.\n\u25cf\nNTIC relies on others for its production and any interruptions of these arrangements could disrupt NTIC\u2019s ability to fill its customers\u2019 orders.\n\u25cf\nChanges to trade regulation, quotas, duties, or tariffs, caused by the changing U.S. and geopolitical environments or otherwise, may negatively impact NTIC\u2019s business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\u25cf\nGlobal credit and financial markets in the past have experienced disruptions, including diminished liquidity and credit availability and rapid fluctuations in market valuations, which, if they happen again, could negatively impact NTIC\u2019s business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\u25cf\nNTIC has limited staffing, faces challenges caused by its aging workforce and given its limited resources, it may not effectively manage its growth.\n\u25cf\nThe evolution of the automotive industry towards electric vehicles could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to NTIC\u2019s Joint Ventures\n\u25cf\nNTIC\u2019s liquidity and financial position rely on the receipt of fees for services provided to its joint ventures and dividend distributions from its joint ventures. No assurance can be provided that NTIC will continue to receive such fees and dividend distributions in amounts NTIC historically has received or anticipates receiving.\n\u25cf\nSince a significant portion of NTIC\u2019s earnings results from its equity income from joint ventures which varies quarter to quarter, NTIC\u2019s earnings are subject to quarterly fluctuations.\nRisks Related to NTIC\u2019s International Operations and the Foreign Markets in which NTIC Operates\n\u25cf\nNTIC\u2019s international business, which is conducted primarily through its subsidiaries and joint ventures, requires management attention and financial resources and exposes NTIC to difficulties and risks presented by international economic, political, legal, accounting, and business factors.\n\u25cf\nIf sales of NTIC\u2019s products and services by its joint venture in Germany were to decline significantly or if NTIC\u2019s relationships with this joint venture were to deteriorate significantly, NTIC\u2019s operating results likely would be adversely affected.\n\u25cf\nNTIC\u2019s acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership interest of HNTI and any future similar acquisitions involve risk.\n\u25cf\nThe ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\u25cf\nNTIC China\u2019s operations may be adversely affected by China\u2019s evolving economic, political, and social conditions and intellectual property rights are difficult to enforce in China, which could harm NTIC\u2019s business, results of operations, or financial condition.\n\u25cf\nUncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system may adversely affect the operations of NTIC China.\n\u25cf\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject NTIC to penalties and legal expenses.\n\u25cf\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in NTIC\u2019s earnings and changes in NTIC\u2019s foreign currency translation adjustments.\n\u25cf\nEconomic uncertainty in developing markets could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s revenue and earnings.\nRisks Related to NTIC\u2019s Products\n\u25cf\nNTIC faces intense competition in almost all of its product lines, including from competitors that have substantially greater resources than NTIC does. No assurance can be provided that NTIC will be able to compete effectively, which would harm its business and operating results.\n\u25cf\nNTIC\u2019s ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services generate a significant portion of NTIC\u2019s net sales and the net sales of NTIC\u2019s joint ventures. Accordingly, if sales of these products and services were to decline, NTIC\u2019s operating results would be adversely affected.\n\u25cf\nIf NTIC is unable to continue to enhance its existing products and develop and market new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance, NTIC may experience a decrease in demand for its products, and its business could suffer.\n\u25cf\nNo assurance can be provided that NTIC\u2019s investments in additional research and development and marketing efforts and resources into the application of its corrosion prevention solutions into the oil and gas industry and the continued launch of its Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds and finished products will be successful.\n\u25cf\nNTIC\u2019s strategy of expanding its corrosion prevention solutions into the oil and gas industry and continuing the expansion of its Natur-Tec\u00ae bioplastics resin compounds and finished products is risky and may not prove to be successful, which could harm NTIC\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\n\u25cf\nNTIC\u2019s dependence on manufacturing and logistical services provided by contractors could give rise to product defect or warranty liability.\n\u25cf\nThe commercial success of NTIC\u2019s Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds and finished products depends on the widespread market acceptance of products manufactured with bio-based and biodegradable resins.\n\u25cf\nNTIC relies on its joint ventures, distributors, manufacturer\u2019s sales representatives, and other agents to market and sell its products.\n\u25cf\nNTIC may be subject to product liability claims or other claims arising out of the activities of its joint ventures, which could adversely affect NTIC and its business, and the sale of ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products into the oil and gas industry is risky in light of the hazards typically associated with such operations and the significant amount of potential liability involved.\n\u25cf\nThe sale of ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products into the oil and gas industry is somewhat seasonal and dependent upon oil prices.\n\u25cf\nThe expansion of NTIC\u2019s corrosion prevention solutions into the oil and gas industry and the continued launch of NTIC\u2019s Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds and finished products may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms.\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulation, Laws, and Compliance\n\u25cf\nNTIC\u2019s business, properties, and products are subject to governmental regulation and taxes, compliance with which may require NTIC to incur expenses or modify its products or operations, and which may expose NTIC to penalties for non-compliance. Governmental regulation also may adversely affect the demand for some of NTIC\u2019s products and its operating results.\n\u25cf\nFluctuations in NTIC\u2019s effective tax rate could have a significant impact on NTIC\u2019s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\u25cf\nCertain of NTIC\u2019s operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\u25cf\nNTIC\u2019s reliance upon patents, trademark laws, trade secrets, and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights may not be sufficient to protect its intellectual property.\n\u25cf\nNTIC\u2019s compliance with generally accepted accounting principles any changes in such principles might adversely affect NTIC\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to NTIC\u2019s Common Stock\n\u25cf\nThe trading volume of NTIC\u2019s common stock is typically very low, leaving NTIC\u2019s common stock open to risk of high volatility and the price and trading volume has been, and may continue to be, volatile.\n\u25cf\nA large percentage of NTIC\u2019s outstanding common stock is held by insiders, and, as a result, the trading market for NTIC\u2019s common stock is not as liquid as the stock of other public companies.\nRisks Related to NTIC\u2019s Business and Industry\nAny weakness in the global economy, and in particular in the United States, Europe, India and China, and in the automotive industry, may negatively impact NTIC\u2019s business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe U.S. and world economies may suffer from uncertainty, volatility, disruption, and other adverse conditions, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and persistent inflation resulting therefrom, and those conditions have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact the business community and the financial markets. Adverse economic and financial market conditions may negatively affect NTIC\u2019s customers and its markets, thereby negatively impacting its business and operating results. For example, weak market conditions could extend the length of NTIC\u2019s sales cycle and cause potential customers to delay, defer, or decline to make purchases of NTIC\u2019s products and services due to uncertainties surrounding the future performance of their businesses, limitations on their capital expenditures due to internal budget constraints, the inability to obtain financing in the capital markets, and the adverse effects of the economy on their business and financial condition. As a result, if economic and financial market conditions weaken or deteriorate, then NTIC\u2019s business, financial condition, and operating results, including its ability to grow and expand its business and operations, could be materially and adversely affected.\nNTIC\u2019s operating results are especially dependent upon the economic health of the economies in the United States, Europe, India and China. Since a significant portion of NTIC\u2019s ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services are sold to customers in the automotive industry, adverse economic conditions affecting the automotive industry, in particular, may result in an adverse effect on NTIC\u2019s net sales and its other operating results. Accordingly, any weakness in the global economy, particularly the United States, Europe, India and China, and in the automotive industry, including decreased production resulting from the ongoing microchip shortage, have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact NTIC\u2019s business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and will likely continue to adversely impact NTIC\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nCOVID-19 has resulted in the curtailment of business activities from time to time, including more recently in China, and has caused weakened economic conditions, both in the United States and abroad. Business closures and slowdowns adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact NTIC directly and caused some of NTIC\u2019s customers and suppliers to operate at a fraction of their capacities or wholly lock down, which disrupted and may continue to disrupt NTIC\u2019s sales and production, especially in China. These and other factors, such as other COVID-19 variants that may arise, contributed to NTIC experiencing decreased global demand for its products and services during certain markets during fiscal 2022 and more widespread during fiscal 2021 and increased supply chain and shipping costs and disruptions, which will likely continue to some degree during fiscal 2023. This decreased demand may have a material adverse effect on NTIC\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition in fiscal 2023. Due to the international reach of COVID-19, NTIC anticipates that its international subsidiaries and joint ventures will continue to be adversely impacted by the causes listed above, as well as other local issues that may arise, which will likely continue to have a material adverse effect on NTIC\u2019s international subsidiaries and joint venture operations and equity in income from joint ventures. It is currently not possible to predict the precise potential impact, as well as the extent of any impact, of the COVID-19 pandemic on NTIC\u2019s business, and on the global economy as a whole. It is also currently not possible to predict how long the pandemic will last or the time that it will take for economic activity to return to prior levels or supply chain disruptions to cease. A prolonged situation could have a significant adverse effect on economies and financial markets globally, potentially deepening the current worldwide economic downturn, which could have a significant adverse effect on NTIC\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition. Any of these events could materially adversely affect NTIC\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has already adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect NTIC\u2019s stock price.\nNTIC\u2019s business may continue to be negatively impacted by inflation.\nIncreases in inflation may have a negative impact on NTIC\u2019s business. Current and future inflationary effects may be driven by, among other things, the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, governmental stimulus or fiscal policies and the Russia/Ukraine war. While the persistent inflation experienced in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022 has somewhat stabilized recently, increases in inflation have impacted the cost of raw materials, the overall demand for NTIC\u2019s products, labor, and the margins NTIC and its joint ventures are able to realize on the sale of products, all of which have had and could continue to have a negative impact on NTIC\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Sustained levels of high inflation caused the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks to increase interest rates, which could increase the cost of capital available to NTIC and depress economic growth, which could also negatively impact our business.\nSupply chain disruptions could interrupt product manufacturing, increase product costs and result in lost sales, which may have a material adverse effect on NTIC\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nDuring fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, supply chain disruptions, resulting from factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, labor supply shortages and shipping container shortages, impacted, and may continue to impact, NTIC and its third-party manufacturers. These disruptions have resulted in longer lead times and increased product costs and shipping expenses. While NTIC has taken steps to minimize the impact of these increased costs by working closely with its suppliers and customers, there can be no assurances that unforeseen events impacting the supply chain will not have a material adverse effect on NTIC in the future. Additionally, the impacts supply chain disruptions have on NTIC\u2019s third-party manufacturers are not within NTIC\u2019s control. While we have seen recent improvements, it is not currently possible to predict how long it will take for these supply chain disruptions to cease. Prolonged supply chain disruptions impacting NTIC and its third-party manufacturers could interrupt product manufacturing, increase product costs and result in lost sales, which may have a material adverse effect on NTIC\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nDisruptions to the distribution channels for NTIC\u2019s products may negatively impact NTIC\u2019s business, operating results, and financial condition.\nDuring fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, supply chain disruptions began to emerge because of the COVID-19 pandemic, shipping container shortages, and the changes in global demand. These conditions and ocean freight capacity issues continued to persist worldwide during fiscal 2022 as there was much greater demand for shipping and reduced capacity and equipment, which resulted in significantly longer shipping times and significant price increases per shipping container. While many of these effects have improved, it is possible that NTIC may continue to experience adverse effects during fiscal 2023. Shipping companies have taken measures such as charging priority booking fees to allocate space as they have fewer ships and workers operating. While we have seen recent stabilizations of container costs and, in some markets, a recent decrease in costs, there is no indication that these shipping delays and increased shipping container rates will return to historical levels in the near-term, and these delays and elevated costs could have a material adverse effect on NTIC\u2019s consolidated results of operations. Furthermore, transportation delays, increases on shipping containers, more extensive travel restrictions, closures or disruptions of businesses and facilities or social, economic, political or labor instability in the affected areas may impact the operations of NTIC\u2019s suppliers, which could in turn adversely affect NTIC, and its revenues and operating costs. Any of these disruptions may negatively impact NTIC\u2019s business, operating results, and financial condition.\nNTIC\u2019s dependence on key suppliers puts NTIC at risk of interruptions in the availability of its products, which could reduce its net sales and adversely affect its operating results and harm its reputation.\nNTIC relies on suppliers for certain raw materials and components used in its products. For reasons of quality assurance, cost effectiveness, or availability, NTIC procures certain raw materials and components from sole or limited source suppliers. Among the limited source suppliers NTIC does business with are the manufacturers of plastic resins used in Natur-Tec\u00ae products. NTIC generally acquires these and other raw materials and components through purchase orders placed in the ordinary course of business, and as a result, NTIC does not have a significant inventory of these materials and components and does not have any guaranteed or contractual supply arrangements with many of these suppliers for these materials and components. NTIC\u2019s dependence on third-party suppliers involves several risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality, and delivery schedules, as well as manufacturing yields and costs. Suppliers of such raw materials and components may decide, or be required, for reasons beyond NTIC\u2019s control, to cease supplying such raw materials and components to NTIC or to raise their prices.\nShortages of raw materials, quality control problems, production capacity constraints, or delays by suppliers could negatively affect NTIC\u2019s ability to meet its production obligations and result in increased prices for affected parts. For example, the rapid growth in demand for bioplastics products globally has increased the demand and the price for plastic resins, and limited suppliers of such plastic resins may experience shortages caused by demand outpacing their production capabilities, which could result in NTIC\u2019s inability to produce its Natur-Tec\u00ae products promptly or in the volumes demanded. Additionally, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused supply shortages, which also could result in NTIC\u2019s inability to produce its Natur-Tec\u00ae products. These and other shortages, constraints, or delays may result in delays in shipments of products or components, which could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s net sales and other operating results and its reputation. From time to time, materials and components used in NTIC\u2019s products are subject to allocation because of shortages of these materials and components.\nIncreases in prices for raw materials and components used in NTIC\u2019s products could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s operating results.\nNTIC uses certain raw materials and components in its products, including in particular plastic resins, which are subject to price increases. In light of increased global demand for bioplastics, production slowdowns due to manufacturing issues, labor shortages and power restrictions in China, freight container shortages, the war in Ukraine, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the prices of certain plastic resins increased in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022 and have remained higher than pre-pandemic prices, which could adversely affect gross margins on NTIC\u2019s Natur-Tec\u00ae products. If these shortages persist, the cost and/or production of NTIC\u2019s products could be adversely affected. Additionally, the war between Russia and Ukraine and the resulting sanctions by U.S. and European governments have resulted in and may continue to result in commodity price fluctuations, which have decreased our margins and the margins of our joint ventures and resulted in decreased joint venture profitability, which will likely continue during fiscal 2023. Finally, changes to international trade agreements could result in additional tariffs, duties, or other charges on raw materials or components we import into the U.S.\nNTIC relies on others for its production and any interruptions of these arrangements could disrupt NTIC\u2019s ability to fill its customers\u2019 orders.\nNTIC utilizes contract manufacturers for a significant portion of its production requirements. The majority of NTIC\u2019s manufacturing is conducted in the United States by contract manufacturers that also perform services for numerous other companies. NTIC does not have a guaranteed level of production capacity with any of its contract manufacturers. Qualifying new contract manufacturers is time consuming and might result in unforeseen manufacturing and operations problems. The loss of NTIC\u2019s relationships with its contract manufacturers or their inability to conduct their manufacturing and assembly services for NTIC as anticipated in terms of capacity, cost, quality, and timeliness could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s ability to fill customer orders in accordance with required delivery, quality, and performance requirements, thus adversely affecting NTIC\u2019s net sales and other operating results.\nChanges to trade regulation, quotas, duties, or tariffs, caused by the changing U.S. and geopolitical environments or otherwise, may negatively impact NTIC\u2019s business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThere is significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and other countries with respect to trade policies, taxes, government regulations, and tariffs. The Trump administration had signaled support for implementing and, in some instances, proposed or took action with respect to major changes to certain trade policies in an effort to encourage U.S. production. Such changes included the imposition of additional tariffs on imported products in an effort to address trade imbalances, specifically with China, the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. In response to such actions, certain countries imposed retaliatory actions against the U.S. NTIC and its subsidiaries and joint ventures engage in sales outside of the United States and is, therefore, negatively impacted by such actions. Any changes or potential changes in trade policies in the United States, including changes made by the Biden administration, and the potential corresponding actions by other countries in which NTIC does business could adversely and materially affect NTIC\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nGlobal credit and financial markets in the past have experienced disruptions, including diminished liquidity and credit availability and rapid fluctuations in market valuations, which, if they happen again, could negatively impact NTIC\u2019s business, operating results, and financial condition.\nAny tightening of the credit and financial markets could negatively impact the ability of companies to borrow money from their existing lenders, obtain credit from other sources, or raise financing to fund their operations. This could negatively impact the ability of NTIC\u2019s customers and the customers of NTIC\u2019s joint ventures to purchase NTIC\u2019s products, suppliers\u2019 ability to provide NTIC and its joint ventures with materials and components, and the ability of NTIC and its joint ventures, distributors, and sales representatives to finance operations, if needed, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any or all of these events could negatively impact NTIC\u2019s business, operating results, and financial condition. Although NTIC maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers, distributors, and joint ventures to make required payments, and such losses historically have been within NTIC\u2019s expectations and the provisions established, NTIC cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same loss rates that it has in the past, especially if there are weaknesses in the worldwide economy. A significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of NTIC\u2019s customers, distributors, or joint ventures could cause unfavorable trends in NTIC\u2019s receivable collections and additional allowances may be required, which could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s operating results. In addition, weaknesses in the worldwide economy, including the imposition of higher tariffs and withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, may adversely impact the ability of suppliers to provide NTIC with materials and components, which could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s business and operating results. NTIC is unable to predict the prospects for a global economic recovery, but the longer the duration of such adverse and uncertain economic conditions, the greater the risks NTIC faces in operating its business.\nNTIC has limited staffing and will continue to be dependent upon key employees.\nNTIC\u2019s success is dependent upon the efforts of a small management team and group of employees. NTIC\u2019s future success will depend in large part on its ability to retain its key employees and identify, attract, and retain other highly qualified managerial, technical, research and development, sales and marketing, and customer service personnel when needed. Competition for these individuals may be intense, especially in the markets in which NTIC operates. NTIC may not succeed in identifying, attracting, and retaining these personnel. Inadequate performance by any of NTIC\u2019s limited staff could have a negative impact on the performance of the company. In addition, none of NTIC\u2019s employees have any contractual obligation to maintain his or her employment with NTIC. The loss or interruption of services of any of NTIC\u2019s key personnel, including in particular its technical personnel, the inability to identify, attract, or retain qualified personnel in the future, delays in hiring qualified personnel, or any employee slowdowns, strikes, or similar actions could make it difficult for NTIC to manage its business and meet key objectives, which could harm NTIC\u2019s business, operating results, and financial condition.\nAlthough we have not experienced any material labor shortage to date, we have recently observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing and distribution facilities and overall business. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high-level, or if mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability, such as overtime and third-party outsourcing, have unintended negative effects, our business could be adversely affected. An overall labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation could have a material adverse impact on NTIC\u2019s operations, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.\nNTIC faces challenges caused by its aging workforce, and NTIC may not be able to recruit, train and retain adequate replacements for its qualified and skilled employees.\nMany of our employees are approaching retirement age. As these experienced employees retire, we may have difficulty recruiting new employees with comparable qualifications and experience, and we may be unable to transfer our employees\u2019 institutional knowledge successfully to new qualified employees. Any such failures would be exacerbated at times of peak demand. Our failure to recruit and train new employees and to ensure they obtain the adequate qualifications and experience could result in reduced revenues, loss of customer goodwill and a material negative impact on our results of operations.\nGiven NTIC\u2019s limited resources, it may not effectively manage its growth.\nNTIC\u2019s strategy to grow its business, including in particular its ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products for the oil and gas industry and its Natur-Tec\u00ae bio-plastic resin compounds and finished products, requires significant management time and operational and financial resources. There is no assurance that NTIC has the necessary operational and financial resources to manage its growth. This is especially true as it expands facilities and manufactures its products on a larger commercial scale. In addition, rapid growth in NTIC\u2019s headcount and operations may place a significant strain on its management, administrative, operational, and financial infrastructure. Failure to adequately manage its growth could have a material and adverse effect on NTIC\u2019s business, operating results, and financial condition. For example, NTIC\u2019s soil side bottom solutions for tanks require implementation teams comprised of both internal NTIC personnel and outside consulting firms. NTIC\u2019s failure to expand these implementation teams to service additional customers may limit NTIC\u2019s ability to grow this business. In addition, NTIC may not be successful in its strategy to grow its business.\nThe evolution of the automotive industry towards electric vehicles could adversely affect our business.\nThe global automotive industry is experiencing a period of significant technological change, including the development and use of electric vehicles, which do not contain as many components that require our ZERUST products and solutions. During fiscal 2022, the automobile sector represented approximately 48% of our ZERUST industrial net sales in North America and 58% of net sales of our joint ventures. Increased demand for electric vehicles which do not contain as many components requiring our ZERUST products and solutions will adversely affect our net sales and other operating results and business.\nRisks Related to NTIC\u2019s Joint Ventures\nNTIC\u2019s liquidity and financial position rely on the receipt of fees for services provided to its joint ventures and dividend distributions from its joint ventures. No assurance can be provided that NTIC will continue to receive such fees and dividend distributions in amounts NTIC historically has received or anticipates receiving.\nNTIC conducts business, either directly or indirectly, through several joint venture arrangements that operate in North America, Europe, and Asia. Each of these joint ventures manufactures, markets, and sells finished products in the geographic territory that it is assigned. NTIC\u2019s receipt of funds as a result of sales by its joint ventures is dependent upon NTIC\u2019s receipt of fees for services that NTIC provides to its joint ventures based primarily on the net sales of the individual joint ventures and NTIC\u2019s receipt of dividend distributions from its joint ventures based on the profitability of its joint ventures. NTIC\u2019s liquidity and financial position in part rely on NTIC\u2019s receipt of fees for services that NTIC provides to its joint ventures and dividend distributions from its joint ventures. During fiscal 2022, NTIC recognized $5,085,823 in fees and $5,723,176 in dividend distributions from its joint ventures. Because NTIC owns 50% or less of each of its joint venture entities, NTIC does not control the decisions of these entities regarding whether to pay dividends and, if paid, how much they should be in any given year. Thus, NTIC cannot guarantee that any of its joint ventures will pay dividends in any given year. The failure of NTIC\u2019s joint ventures to declare dividends or the failure of NTIC to receive fees for services provided to joint ventures in amounts typically expected by NTIC could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s liquidity and financial position.\nSince a significant portion of NTIC\u2019s earnings results from NTIC\u2019s equity income from joint ventures, and since NTIC\u2019s equity income from joint ventures varies from quarter to quarter, NTIC\u2019s earnings are subject to quarterly fluctuations.\nA significant portion of NTIC\u2019s earnings results from NTIC\u2019s equity income from its joint ventures. NTIC\u2019s equity in income from joint ventures consists of NTIC\u2019s share of equity in income from its joint ventures based on the overall profitability of the joint ventures. Such profitability varies from quarter to quarter. Since NTIC\u2019s management typically receives quarterly joint venture financial information after the completion of each fiscal quarter, it is impossible for NTIC\u2019s management to cut costs and expenses to make up for any unanticipated shortfall in NTIC\u2019s equity income from joint ventures. Accordingly, the variability in NTIC\u2019s equity income from joint ventures, in turn, subjects NTIC\u2019s earnings to quarterly fluctuations.\nRisks Related to NTIC\u2019s International Business and the Foreign Markets in which NTIC Operates\nNTIC\u2019s international business, which is conducted primarily through its subsidiaries and joint ventures, requires management attention and financial resources and exposes NTIC to difficulties and risks presented by international economic, political, legal, accounting, and business factors.\nNTIC sells products and services directly, through its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, and indirectly, via a network of joint ventures, independent distributors, manufacturer\u2019s sales representatives, and agents in over 65 countries, including countries in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. One of NTIC\u2019s strategic objectives is the continued expansion of its international operations. The expansion of NTIC\u2019s existing international operations and entry into additional international markets requires management attention and financial resources.\nThe sale and shipping of products and services across international borders subjects NTIC to extensive and complicated U.S. and foreign governmental trade regulations. Compliance with such regulations is costly and exposes NTIC to penalties for non-compliance. Other laws and regulations that can significantly impact NTIC include various anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, laws restricting business with suspected terrorists, and anti-boycott laws. Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact NTIC in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil, and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments, and restrictions on certain business activities. Also, the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of NTIC\u2019s shipping and sales activities.\nSeveral factors, including implications of withdrawal by the U.S. from, or revision to, international trade agreements, foreign policy changes between the U.S. and other countries, weakened international economic conditions, or the impact of sovereign debt defaults by certain European countries, could adversely affect our international net sales. Additionally, the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets require significant management attention and financial resources. In many of the countries in which NTIC sells its products directly or indirectly through NTIC China, Zerust Brazil, Natur-Tec India, Natur-Tec Lanka, Zerust Mexico, Zerust Singapore, Zerust Vietnam and NTI Asean, its joint ventures, distributors, representatives, and agents are, to some degree, subject to political, economic, and/or social instability. NTIC\u2019s international operations expose NTIC and its joint venture partners, distributors, representatives, and agents to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions. These risks include:\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in managing and staffing international operations and the required infrastructure costs, including legal, tax, accounting, and information technology;\n\u25cf\nthe imposition of additional U.S. and foreign governmental controls or regulations, new trade restrictions, and restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives, and distributors, the imposition of costly and lengthy export licensing requirements and changes in duties and tariffs, license obligations, and other non-tariff barriers to trade;\n\u25cf\nthe imposition of U.S. and/or international sanctions against a country, company, person, or entity with whom NTIC does business that would restrict or prohibit continued business with the sanctioned country, company, person, or entity;\n\u25cf\npricing pressure that NTIC or its joint ventures, distributors, representatives, and agents may experience internationally;\n\u25cf\nlaws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u25cf\nadverse currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u25cf\nlonger payment cycles and difficulties enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u25cf\nnational and international conflicts, including foreign policy changes or terrorist acts;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in enforcing or defending intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf\nmultiple, changing, and often inconsistent enforcement of laws and regulations; and\n\u25cf\nthe potential payment of U.S. income taxes on certain earnings of joint ventures upon repatriation.\nFurthermore, in June 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d The United Kingdom officially terminated its membership of the European Union on January 31, 2020 and remained in a transition phase until December 31, 2020. Although the United Kingdom and the European Union struck a bilateral trade and cooperation deal governing the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, which became effective on May 1, 2021, political and economic uncertainties remain, and it is possible that there will be increased regulatory complexities, which could affect NTIC\u2019s ability to sell its products in certain European Union countries and subject NTIC to heightened risks in that region. Any of these effects of Brexit, and other similar referenda that NTIC cannot anticipate, could adversely affect its business, operations, and financial results.\nOut of NTIC\u2019s joint ventures, NTIC\u2019s joint venture in Germany is the most significant in terms of assets and income to NTIC. If sales of NTIC\u2019s products and services by this joint venture were to decline significantly or if NTIC\u2019s relationships with this joint venture were to deteriorate significantly, NTIC\u2019s operating results likely would be adversely affected.\nNTIC considers its joint venture in Germany (EXCOR) to be individually significant to NTIC\u2019s consolidated assets and income and, therefore, provides certain additional information regarding EXCOR in the notes to NTIC\u2019s consolidated financial statements and in certain sections of this report. Of the total equity in income from joint ventures of $4,725,918 during fiscal 2022, NTIC had equity in income from joint ventures of $3,236,989 attributable to EXCOR. Of the total fee income for services provided to joint ventures of $5,767,682 during fiscal 2022, fees of $834,725 were attributable to EXCOR. Accordingly, if sales of NTIC\u2019s products and services by this joint venture were to decline significantly or if NTIC\u2019s relationships with this joint venture were to deteriorate significantly such that the joint venture terminated or was not motivated to sell NTIC\u2019s products and services, NTIC\u2019s operating results likely would be adversely affected. While this is also true with respect to the other joint venture entities of which additional information is provided in NTIC\u2019s consolidated financial statements and in certain other sections of this report, the significance is not as great as with EXCOR.\nNTIC\u2019s acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership interest of HNTI and any future similar acquisitions involve risk.\nEffective as of September 1, 2021, NTIC acquired the remaining 50% ownership interest in its Indian joint venture, HNTI. It is possible that as part of its succession planning efforts with respect to its joint venture partners that NTIC may complete similar acquisitions in the future. Similar future acquisitions will depend, in part, on the availability of similar opportunities or other suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices, terms, and conditions and the availability of capital and personnel resources to complete such acquisitions and run and integrate the acquired business effectively. These acquisitions involve risk and may harm NTIC\u2019s business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. For instance, the benefits of the HNTI acquisition or any future acquisition may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into NTIC\u2019s operations, and NTIC cannot guarantee that either the HNTI or any future acquisitions will, in fact, produce any long-term benefits. Acquisitions, such as the HNTI acquisition, involve a number of risks, the occurrence of which could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results, including:\n\u25cf\ndiversion of management's attention to manage and integrate the acquired business;\n\u25cf\ndisruption to existing operations and plans;\n\u25cf\ninability to effectively manage the expanded operations;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties or delays, which may be exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19, in integrating and assimilating information and financial systems, internal controls, operations, manufacturing processes and products of an acquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies, growth prospects, cost savings, and other synergies;\n\u25cf\npotential loss of key employees, customers or suppliers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing business relationships with employees, customers or suppliers;\n\u25cf\nwrite-off of significant amounts of goodwill, other intangible assets, and/or long-lived assets as a result of deterioration in the performance of an acquired business, adverse market conditions, changes in the competitive landscape, changes in laws or regulations that restrict activities of an acquired business, or as a result of a variety of other circumstances;\n\u25cf\nviolation of confidentiality, intellectual property, and non-compete obligations or agreements by employees of an acquired business or lack of or inadequate formal intellectual property protection mechanisms in place at an acquired business;\n\u25cf\nadverse impact on overall profitability if NTIC\u2019s expanded operations do not achieve the growth prospects, net sales, net earnings, cost and/or revenue synergies, or other financial results projected in NTIC\u2019s valuation models, delays in the realization thereof or costs or charges incurred to achieve any revenue or cost synergies;\n\u25cf\nreallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives and/or an increase in leverage and debt service requirements to pay acquisition purchase prices, which could in turn restrict NTIC\u2019s ability to access additional capital when needed or limit its ability to pursue other important elements of its business strategy;\n\u25cf\ninaccurate assessment of additional post-acquisition, undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems, unanticipated costs associated with an acquisition; and\n\u25cf\nimpacts as a result of purchase accounting adjustments, incorrect estimates made in the accounting for acquisitions, incurrence of non-recurring charges, or other potential financial accounting or reporting impacts.\nIn addition, effective internal controls are necessary for NTIC to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. The integration of acquired businesses may result in NTIC\u2019s systems and controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. NTIC devotes significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. However, it cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that NTIC designs, implements, and maintains adequate control over its financial processes and reporting in the future, particularly in the context of acquisitions of other businesses. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into NTIC\u2019s internal control framework could harm its operating results or cause NTIC to fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. Also, acquisitions require the consent of PNC Bank, National Association under NTIC\u2019s loan agreement with PNC Bank. NTIC cannot predict whether such approvals would be forthcoming or the terms on which PNC Bank would approve such acquisitions. These risks, among others, could be heightened if NTIC completes a large acquisition or multiple transactions within a relatively short period of time.\nThe ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nGiven the nature of our business and our global operations, political, economic, and other conditions in foreign countries and regions, including geopolitical risks such as the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, may adversely affect our business and results of operations. We have limited operations in Russia and Ukraine, which have been adversely affected by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, though these losses are not expected to have a material impact on our operating results. We terminated our joint venture in Russia in May 2022, which we believe will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition given the immateriality of the joint venture. The broader consequences of this conflict, which may include additional international sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts; increased tensions between the United States and countries in which we operate; and the extent of the conflict\u2019s effect on our business and results of operations as well as the global economy, cannot be predicted.\nTo the extent the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine adversely affects our business, it may also have the effect of heightening many other risks disclosed herein, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Such risks include, but are not limited to, adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, demand for our products and potential recessionary economic conditions; increased cyber security threats; adverse changes in trade policies, taxes, government regulations, and tariffs; our ability to maintain or increase our prices in response to rising shipping costs; our ability to implement and execute our business strategy, particularly with regard to our joint ventures; disruptions in global supply chains; our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; and constraints, volatility, or disruption in the capital markets.\nThe operations of NTIC China may be adversely affected by China\u2019s evolving economic, political, and social conditions.\nThe results of operations and future prospects of NTIC China may be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in China\u2019s political, economic, and social conditions, changes in the relationship between China and its western trade partners, changes in policies of the Chinese government, changes in laws and regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations, changes in foreign exchange regulations, measures that may be introduced to control inflation, such as interest rate increases, and changes in the rates or methods of taxation. In addition, changes in demand could result from increased competition with local Chinese manufacturers who have cost advantages or who may be preferred suppliers for Chinese end users. Also, Chinese commercial laws, regulations, and interpretations applicable to non-Chinese owned market participants, such as NTIC China, are continually changing. These laws, regulations, and interpretations could impose restrictions on NTIC\u2019s and NTIC China\u2019s ownership or operations or NTIC\u2019s interests in China and could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nLocal regulations in China related to the electric power shortage that began in 2021 may adversely affect NTIC China\u2019s operations or the operations of our suppliers with facilities in China. For example, these regulations could result in partial or complete factory shutdowns due to a lack of continuous supply of electrical power. Additionally, the price of electric power may be increased, and peak-demand periods during which prices are higher may be extended by local governments. Certain of our resin suppliers with facilities in China were adversely impacted by these regulations, which contributed to constrained supply. Although NTIC China\u2019s operations have not been significantly impacted by regulations related to electric power shortages to date, such regulations may in the future decrease or shut down production or increase product costs, which could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIntellectual property rights are difficult to enforce in China, which could harm NTIC\u2019s business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nChinese commercial law is relatively undeveloped compared to commercial law in many of NTIC\u2019s other major markets, and limited protection of intellectual property is available in China as a practical matter. Although NTIC takes precautions in the operation of NTIC China to protect NTIC\u2019s intellectual property, any local manufacturer of products that NTIC undertakes in China could subject NTIC to an increased risk that unauthorized parties will be able to copy or otherwise obtain or use NTIC\u2019s intellectual property, which could harm NTIC\u2019s business. NTIC may also have limited legal recourse in the event it encounters patent or trademark infringers, which could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nUncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system may adversely affect the operations of NTIC China.\nNTIC China is subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China. There are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of laws, rules, and policies in China. The Chinese legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions have limited precedential value. Because many laws and regulations are relatively new, and the Chinese legal system is still evolving, the interpretations of many laws, regulations, and rules are not always uniform. Moreover, the relative inexperience of China\u2019s judiciary in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation, and the interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political agendas. Finally, enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic. For the preceding reasons, it may be difficult for NTIC or NTIC China to obtain timely or equitable enforcement of laws ostensibly designed to protect companies like NTIC or NTIC China, which could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject NTIC to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm its reputation and have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nNTIC is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which generally prohibits covered entities and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other benefits. In addition, the FCPA imposes accounting standards and requirements on U.S. publicly-traded corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments and to prevent the establishment of \u201coff books\u201d slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. NTIC also is subject to similar anticorruption legislation implemented in Europe under the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. NTIC and its joint ventures, distributors, independent representatives, and agents operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential violations of the FCPA and other anticorruption laws, based on measurements such as Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index, and NTIC utilizes a number of joint ventures, distributors, independent representatives, and agents for whose actions NTIC could be held liable under the FCPA. NTIC informs its personnel, joint ventures, distributors, independent representatives, and agents of the requirements of the FCPA and other anticorruption laws, including, but not limited to, their reporting requirements. NTIC also has developed and will continue to develop and implement systems for formalizing its contracting processes, performing due diligence on agents, and improving its recordkeeping and auditing practices regarding these regulations. However, there is no guarantee that NTIC\u2019s employees, joint ventures, distributors, independent representatives, or other agents have not or will not engage in conduct undetected by NTIC\u2019s processes and for which NTIC might be held responsible under the FCPA or other anticorruption laws.\nIf NTIC\u2019s employees, joint ventures, distributors, third-party sales representatives, or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, NTIC could suffer severe penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, and other remedial measures, including further changes or enhancements to its procedures, policies, and controls and potential personnel changes and disciplinary actions.\nCertain private and foreign companies, including some of NTIC\u2019s competitors, are not subject to prohibitions as strict as those under the FCPA or, even if subjected to strict prohibitions, such prohibitions may be laxly enforced in practice. If NTIC\u2019s competitors engage in corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft, or other fraudulent practices, they may receive preferential treatment from personnel of some companies or from government officials, giving NTIC\u2019s competitors an advantage in securing business and putting NTIC at a disadvantage.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in NTIC\u2019s earnings and changes in NTIC\u2019s foreign currency translation adjustments.\nBecause the functional currency of NTIC\u2019s foreign operations is the applicable local currency, NTIC is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business. NTIC\u2019s principal exchange rate exposure is with the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the Indian Rupee, the Chinese Renminbi, the South Korean Won, and the English Pound against the U.S. dollar. NTIC\u2019s fees for services provided to its joint ventures and dividend distributions from these foreign entities are paid in foreign currencies; thus, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in NTIC\u2019s earnings. Any changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected as a foreign currency translation adjustment and would not change NTIC\u2019s equity in income from joint ventures reflected in its consolidated statements of operations. NTIC does not hedge against its foreign currency exchange rate risk.\nEconomic uncertainty in developing markets could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s revenue and earnings.\nNTIC conducts business, or is contemplating expansion, in developing markets with economies that tend to be more volatile than those in the United States and Western Europe. The risk of doing business in developing markets such as China, Brazil, India, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Mexico, and other economically volatile areas could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s operations and earnings. Such risks include the financial instability among customers in these regions, political instability, fraud or corruption, and other non-economic factors, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and irregular trade flows that need to be managed successfully with the help of the local governments. In addition, commercial laws in some developing countries can be vague, inconsistently administered, and retroactively applied. If NTIC is deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in developing countries where NTIC conducts business, its prospects and business in those countries could be harmed, which could then have a material adverse impact on NTIC\u2019s operating results and financial position. NTIC\u2019s failure to successfully manage economic, political, and other risks relating to doing business in developing countries and economically and politically volatile areas could adversely affect its business.\nRisks Related to NTIC\u2019s Products\nNTIC faces intense competition in almost all of its product lines, including from competitors that have substantially greater resources than NTIC does. No assurance can be provided that NTIC will be able to compete effectively, which would harm its business and operating results.\nNTIC\u2019s products are sold in intensely competitive markets throughout the world. This intense competition could result in pricing pressures, lower sales, reduced margins, and lower market share. With respect to its rust and corrosion inhibiting products, NTIC competes on the basis of product innovation, quality, reliability, product support, customer service, reputation, and price. With respect to its Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds and finished products, NTIC competes on the basis of performance, brand awareness, distribution network, product availability, product offering, shelf life, place of manufacture, and price. NTIC often competes with numerous manufacturers, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing, and other resources than NTIC. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly than NTIC to new or emerging technologies, industry trends, and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than NTIC. In addition, competition could increase if new companies enter the markets in which NTIC competes, especially when the barriers to entry are low, which may be true with respect to NTIC\u2019s rust and corrosion prevention business, or if existing competitors expand their product lines or intensify efforts within existing product lines. NTIC\u2019s current products, products under development, and its ability to develop new and improved products may be insufficient to enable NTIC to compete effectively with its competitors. No assurance can be provided that NTIC will be able to compete effectively, which would harm its business and operating results. In particular, NTIC has experienced more intense competition with respect to many of its traditional ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services, which has led to decreased pricing and smaller margins for NTIC. In fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, NTIC has experienced lower margins on its contracts with Chinese automotive customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and an increase in the production of electric vehicles, which have fewer parts that require corrosion inhibiting packaging. NTIC anticipates that such intense competition likely will continue and that new competitors may emerge, including plastic extrusion companies, which would continue to adversely affect NTIC\u2019s operating results.\nNTIC\u2019s ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services generate a significant portion of NTIC\u2019s net sales and the net sales of NTIC\u2019s joint ventures. Accordingly, if sales of these products and services were to decline, NTIC\u2019s operating results would be adversely affected.\nNTIC\u2019s ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services generate a significant portion of NTIC\u2019s net sales and the net sales of NTIC\u2019s joint ventures. During fiscal 2022, 77.5% of NTIC\u2019s consolidated net sales were derived from sales of ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services. While the net sales of NTIC\u2019s joint ventures are not included in NTIC\u2019s net sales on NTIC\u2019s consolidated financial statements, NTIC\u2019s receipt of fees for services that NTIC provides to its joint ventures and NTIC\u2019s receipt of dividend distributions from its joint ventures are based primarily on the revenues and profitability of the joint ventures. Accordingly, if sales of these products and services were to decline due to increased competition, the introduction of a new disruptive technology, or otherwise, NTIC\u2019s operating results would be adversely affected.\nIf NTIC is unable to continue to enhance its existing products and develop and market new products that respond to customer needs and achieve market acceptance, NTIC may experience a decrease in demand for its products, and its business could suffer.\nOne of NTIC\u2019s strategies is to enhance its existing products and develop and market new products that respond to customer needs. NTIC may not be able to compete effectively with its competitors unless NTIC can keep up with existing or new products or alternative technologies in the markets in which it competes. Product development requires significant research and development, financial, and other resources. Although in the past NTIC has implemented lean manufacturing and other productivity improvement initiatives to provide investment funding for new products, no assurance can be provided that NTIC will be able to continue to do so in the future. Product improvements and new product introductions also require significant planning, design, development, and testing at the technological, product, and manufacturing process levels, and NTIC may not be able to timely develop product improvements or new products. NTIC\u2019s competitors\u2019 new products may beat NTIC\u2019s products to market, may be more effective or less expensive than NTIC\u2019s products, or may render NTIC\u2019s products obsolete. Any new products that NTIC may develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for NTIC relative to its expectations, based on, among other things, existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising, marketing, promotional programs, and research and development.\nNTIC has invested and intends to continue to invest additional research and development and marketing efforts and resources into the application of its corrosion prevention solutions into the oil and gas industry and the continued launch of its Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds and finished products. No assurance can be provided, however, that NTIC\u2019s investments in these new markets and products will be successful and result in additional revenue to NTIC.\nIn an effort to increase net sales, NTIC has expanded the marketing of its corrosion prevention solutions into the oil and gas industry and its Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds and finished products. NTIC expects to continue to invest additional research and development and marketing efforts and resources into these strategic initiatives. No assurance can be provided, however, that such strategic initiatives will be successful or that NTIC will be successful in obtaining additional revenue as a result of them. The introduction of new products into new markets takes significant resources, and there can be no assurance that NTIC is dedicating a sufficient amount of resources to ensure the success of these strategic initiatives. The sale of NTIC\u2019s ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services into the oil and gas industry, in particular, typically involves a long sales cycle, often including a one- to multi-year trial period with each customer and a slow integration process thereafter. This long sales cycle may cause NTIC\u2019s management, stockholders, and investors to lose faith in the business opportunities for NTIC\u2019s ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products and services in the oil and gas industry. Additionally, projects NTIC completes for oil and gas industry customers typically involve short turnaround times, and failure to meet these expectations could damage NTIC\u2019s ability to successfully promote its corrosion prevention solutions into the oil and gas industry.\nNTIC\u2019s strategy of expanding its corrosion prevention solutions into the oil and gas industry and continuing the expansion of its Natur-Tec\u00ae bioplastics resin compounds and finished products is risky and may not prove to be successful, which could harm NTIC\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nNTIC\u2019s strategy of expanding its corrosion prevention solutions into the oil and gas industry and continuing the expansion of its Natur-Tec\u00ae bioplastics resin compounds and finished products, either directly or indirectly through joint ventures and independent distributors and agents, is risky and subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including:\n\u25cf\nthe absence of a significant operating history;\n\u25cf\nthe lack of commercialized products;\n\u25cf\nthe lack of market acceptance of new products;\n\u25cf\nexpected substantial and continual losses for such businesses for the foreseeable future;\n\u25cf\nthe lack of manufacturing experience and limited marketing experience;\n\u25cf\nan expected reliance on third parties for the manufacture and commercialization of some of the products;\n\u25cf\na competitive environment characterized by numerous, well-established and well-capitalized competitors;\n\u25cf\ninsufficient capital and other resources; and\n\u25cf\nreliance on key personnel and the need to hire and train local support in a timely manner in order to support customer needs; and\n\u25cf\nNTIC\u2019s dependence on manufacturing and logistical services provided by contractors could give rise to product defect or warranty liability.\nNTIC uses third-party manufacturers to produce the majority of its products. In addition, NTIC relies upon certain contractors for logistical services. Although NTIC\u2019s arrangements with its contract manufacturers and contractors may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, NTIC may remain responsible to its customers for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability. In addition, product defects could harm NTIC\u2019s reputation amongst its customers.\nThe commercial success of NTIC\u2019s Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds and finished products depends on the widespread market acceptance of products manufactured with bio-based and biodegradable resins.\nAlthough there is a developed market for petroleum-based plastics, the market for \u201cbioplastics\u201d which are plastics produced with bio-based resins, which are derived from renewable resources such as corn or cellulosic/plant material or blends thereof, or plastics that are engineered to be fully biodegradable or both, is still developing. The commercial success of NTIC\u2019s Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds and finished products depends on the widespread market acceptance of products manufactured with bio-based and biodegradable resins, which may result, in part, from government action at the federal, state or local level. For example, in June 2022, the State of California passed a law intended to reduce single-use plastics. Internationally, the government of India recently announced a phased ban on the manufacture and sale of single-use plastics beginning in July 2022. Similarly, in January 2021, China implemented a ban on single-use plastic utensils, bags and certain other single-use plastic items. Despite these efforts and other measures taken at the federal, state and local levels, including policies related to the collection of organics, it is currently difficult to assess or predict with any assurance the potential size, timing, and viability of market opportunities for NTIC\u2019s Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds and finished products. The traditional plastics market sector is well-established with entrenched competitors with whom NTIC competes. Pricing for traditional plastics has been highly volatile in recent years, which drives, to some extent, the commercial and other support for bioplastics. While NTIC expects to be able to command a premium price for its Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds and finished products, a widening gap in the pricing for bioplastics versus petroleum-based plastics may reduce the size of the addressable market for NTIC\u2019s Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds and finished products. In addition, the growth of the market will create some pressure on price for applications today considered commodities, including in particular NTIC\u2019s current Natur-Tec\u00ae finished products.\nNTIC relies on its joint ventures, distributors, manufacturer\u2019s sales representatives, and other agents to market and sell its products.\nIn addition to its direct sales force, NTIC relies on its joint ventures, distributors, manufacturer\u2019s sales representatives, and other agents to market and sell its products in the United States and internationally. NTIC\u2019s joint ventures, distributors, manufacturer\u2019s sales representatives, and other agents might terminate their relationship with NTIC or devote insufficient sales efforts to NTIC\u2019s products. NTIC does not control its joint ventures, distributors, manufacturer\u2019s sales representatives, and other agents, and they may not be successful in implementing NTIC\u2019s marketing plans. NTIC\u2019s failure to maintain its existing relationships with these entities, or its failure to recruit and retain additional skilled joint venture partners, distributors, manufacturer\u2019s sales representatives, and other agents, could have an adverse effect on NTIC\u2019s operations. It is anticipated that several of NTIC\u2019s joint venture partners will retire during the next several years, which will require a transition on the part of the joint venture as well as NTIC and could harm NTIC\u2019s relationship with the joint venture and NTIC\u2019s business.\nNTIC may be subject to product liability claims or other claims arising out of the activities of its joint ventures, which could adversely affect NTIC and its business.\nWhile NTIC is not aware of any specific potential risk beyond its initial investment in, and any undistributed earnings of, each of its joint ventures, there can be no assurance that NTIC will not be subject to lawsuits based on product liability claims or other claims arising out of the activities of its joint ventures. To mitigate the ramifications of such an occurrence, NTIC maintains liability insurance specifically applicable to its ownership positions in its joint venture arrangements in excess of any insurance the joint ventures may maintain. No assurance can be provided, however, that such insurance will be available or adequate in the event of a claim.\nThe sale of ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products into the oil and gas industry is risky in light of the hazards typically associated with such operations and the significant amount of potential liability involved, which could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s business if ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products are involved, even if the cause of such events was not related to NTIC\u2019s products.\nBecause NTIC sells its ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products into the oil and gas industry, NTIC is subject to some of the risks and hazards typically associated with such operations, including hazards such as fire, explosion, blowouts, cratering, unplanned gas releases, and spills, each of which could be claimed to be attributed to the failure of NTIC\u2019s products to perform as anticipated. If such events occur and NTIC\u2019s products are involved, NTIC\u2019s business and operating results may suffer, even if the cause of such events was not related to NTIC\u2019s products.\nThe sale of ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products into the oil and gas industry is dependent on certain macroeconomic factors, including seasonality of installations, fluctuations of crude oil prices, global events and regulatory guidelines.\nSeasonality of Installations: In the past, NTIC has experienced some seasonality with respect to the sale of its ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products into the oil and gas industry, with sales during parts of the second and third fiscal quarters being adversely affected by winter in the United States.\nFluctuations of Crude Oil Prices: The sale of NTIC\u2019s ZERUST\u00ae rust and corrosion inhibiting products into the oil and gas industry, particularly in the United States, has historically been hampered by low/unstable global crude oil prices. Although the price of crude oil neared an all-time high in fiscal 2022, low global crude oil prices have been and may in the future be caused OPEC decisions and other macroeconomic factors affecting supply and demand. NTIC believes low global crude oil prices constrain capital improvement budgets of its existing and prospective customers and may result in personnel turnover at its oil and gas customers or prospects. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has escalated tensions between Russia and other countries, some of which have imposed sanctions and taken other economic actions that have contributed to, and are expected to continue to contribute to, rising global crude oil prices, which prices had already risen substantially due to inflationary pressures. Additional international sanctions against Russia may be imposed, which could further increase these costs. NTIC believes the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the continued impact of high rates of inflation may create uncertainty among its existing and prospective customers, which may cause them to halt oil and gas projects or elect to decrease capital improvement budgets, either of which could harm NTIC\u2019s ability to sell its products into the oil and gas industry.\nGlobal Events: The sale of Zerust Oil & Gas solutions to Oil & Gas sector clients is impacted by events like the COVID pandemic and geopolitical tensions in key oil producing regions like the Middle East. These affect the ability of the teams to have face-to-face meetings, travel for site surveys and implementations, etc., with the added effect of potential supply chain delays/impacts that could delay or postpone sales.\nRegulatory Guidelines: The Oil & Gas sector is very conservative and, in addition to long-term trials on-site, client decision makers typically default to guidelines from the American Petroleum Institute (API), Association of Materials Protection and Performance (AMPP), Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), European Committee for the Study of Corrosion (CEOCOR), etc. Getting a new technology/solution approach included in these guidelines typically takes years of committee lobbying, client support, field trials and lab validation. The Zerust solutions have been included in several technical reports/committees from these groups though getting full validation is likely to take a few more years.\nThe expansion of NTIC\u2019s corrosion prevention solutions into the oil and gas industry and the continued launch of NTIC\u2019s Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds and finished products may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms. In addition, any equity financings may be dilutive to NTIC\u2019s stockholders.\nThe expansion of NTIC\u2019s corrosion prevention solutions into the oil and gas industry and the continued expansion of NTIC\u2019s Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds and finished products will continue to require resources during fiscal 2023 and beyond. To the extent that NTIC\u2019s existing capital, including amounts available under its revolving line of credit, is insufficient to meet these requirements, NTIC may raise additional capital through financings or additional borrowings. Any equity or debt financing, if available at all, may be on terms that are not favorable to NTIC, and any equity financings could result in dilution to NTIC\u2019s stockholders.\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulation, Laws, and Compliance\nNTIC\u2019s business, properties, and products are subject to governmental regulation and taxes, compliance with which may require NTIC to incur expenses or modify its products or operations, and which may expose NTIC to penalties for non-compliance. Governmental regulation also may adversely affect the demand for some of NTIC\u2019s products and its operating results.\nNTIC\u2019s business, properties, and products are subject to a wide variety of international, federal, state, and local laws, rules, taxes, and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, natural resources, and worker health and safety and the use, management, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, and other regulated materials. These laws, rules, and regulations may affect the way NTIC conducts its operations, and the failure to comply with these regulations could lead to fines and other penalties. These laws, rules, and regulations may be subject to change by the Biden administration, which has stalled construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline and may in the future take action to further restrict such activities. Additionally, new environmental laws, rules, and regulations, such as certain provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes measures to reduce emissions, may be enacted, which may adversely affect NTIC\u2019s business. Further, because NTIC owns and operates real property, various environmental laws also may impose liability on NTIC for the costs of cleaning up and responding to hazardous substances that may have been released on NTIC\u2019s property, including releases unknown to NTIC. These environmental laws and regulations also could require NTIC to pay for environmental remediation and response costs at third-party locations where NTIC disposed of or recycled hazardous substances. NTIC\u2019s future costs of complying with the various environmental requirements, as they now exist or may be altered in the future, could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s financial condition and operating results. NTIC is also subject to other international, federal, and state laws, rules, and regulations, the future non-compliance with which may harm NTIC\u2019s business or may adversely affect the demand for some of its products. Changes in laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards and taxation changes, including tax rate changes, new tax laws, including the changes to U.S. federal tax laws included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, such as a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases, and revised tax law interpretations, also may adversely affect NTIC\u2019s operating results.\nFluctuations in NTIC\u2019s effective tax rate could have a significant impact on NTIC\u2019s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe mix of pre-tax income or loss among the tax jurisdictions in which NTIC operates, which have varying tax rates, could impact NTIC\u2019s effective tax rate. NTIC is subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes, other tax liabilities, interest, and penalties. Future events could change management\u2019s assessment. NTIC operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. NTIC also has made assumptions about the realization of deferred tax assets. Changes in these assumptions or jurisdictional regulations could result in a valuation allowance for these assets. Final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is currently reflected by NTIC\u2019s income tax provisions and accruals.\nCertain of NTIC\u2019s operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\nThe manufacture, sale, and use of NTIC\u2019s Natur-Tec\u00ae bio-plastic resin compounds are subject to regulation by the U.S. FDA. The FDA\u2019s regulations are concerned with substances used indirectly in food packaging materials, not with specific finished food packaging products. Thus, food and beverage containers are in compliance with FDA regulations if the components used in the food and beverage containers: (i) are approved by the FDA as indirect food additives for their intended uses and comply with the applicable FDA indirect food additive regulations; or (ii) are generally recognized as safe for their intended uses and are of suitable purity for those intended uses. NTIC believes that its Natur-Tec\u00ae resin compounds comply with all FDA requirements. However, failure to comply with FDA regulations could subject NTIC to administrative, civil, or criminal penalties.\nNTIC\u2019s compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and any changes in such principles might adversely affect NTIC\u2019s operating results and financial condition. Any requirement to consolidate NTIC\u2019s joint ventures could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nIf there were a change in accounting rules and NTIC were required to fully consolidate its joint ventures or if NTIC\u2019s joint ventures otherwise would be required to be consolidated with NTIC, NTIC and the individual joint venture would incur significant additional costs. In addition, other accounting pronouncements issued in the future could have a material cost associated with NTIC\u2019s implementation of such new accounting pronouncements.\nRisks Related to NTIC\u2019s Intellectual Property\nNTIC\u2019s reliance upon patents, trademark laws, trade secrets, and contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights may not be sufficient to protect its intellectual property from others who may sell similar products.\nNTIC holds patents relating to various aspects of its products and believes that proprietary technical know-how is critical to many of its products. Proprietary rights relating to NTIC\u2019s products are protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are maintained in confidence as trade secrets. NTIC cannot be certain that it will be issued any patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to NTIC or that the claims allowed under any issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect its technology. In the absence of patent protection, NTIC may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy NTIC\u2019s products or gain access to its trade secrets and know-how. NTIC\u2019s competitors may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of NTIC\u2019s patents, or they may use their resources to design comparable products that do not infringe NTIC\u2019s patents. NTIC may incur substantial costs if its competitors initiate litigation to challenge the validity of its patents or if it initiates any proceedings to protect its proprietary rights, and if the outcome of any such litigation is unfavorable to NTIC, its business and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, NTIC relies substantially on trade secrets and proprietary know-how that it seeks to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with its employees and consultants. These agreements may be breached, and NTIC may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. Even if these confidentiality agreements are not breached, NTIC\u2019s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.\nRisks Related to NTIC\u2019s Common Stock\nThe trading volume of NTIC\u2019s common stock is typically very low, leaving NTIC\u2019s common stock open to risk of high volatility.\nThe number of shares of NTIC\u2019s common stock being traded daily is often very low, and on some trading days, there is no trading volume at all. During fiscal 2022, the daily trading volume ranged from 0 shares to 40,600 shares. Any NTIC stockholder wishing to sell his, her, or its stock may cause a significant fluctuation in the trading price of NTIC\u2019s common stock. In addition, low trading volume of a stock increases the possibility that, despite rules against such activity, the price of the stock may be manipulated by persons acting in their own self-interest. NTIC may not have adequate market makers and market making activity to prevent manipulation in its common stock.\nThe price and trading volume of NTIC\u2019s common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile.\nThe market price and trading volume of NTIC\u2019s common stock price historically has fluctuated over a wide range. During fiscal 2022, the sale price of NTIC\u2019s common stock ranged from a low of $9.05 per share to a high of $18.00 per share, and the daily trading volume ranged from 0 shares to 40,600 shares. It is likely that the price and trading volume of NTIC\u2019s common stock will continue to fluctuate in the future. The securities of small capitalization companies, including NTIC, from time-to-time experience significant price and volume fluctuations, often unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. Securities class action litigation is sometimes brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities or for other reasons. NTIC may become the target of similar litigation, especially if NTIC fails to meet its annual projected financial guidance or lowers its annual projected financial guidance. Securities litigation, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm NTIC\u2019s business, operating results, and financial condition as well as the market price of its common stock.\nA large percentage of NTIC\u2019s outstanding common stock is held by insiders, and, as a result, the trading market for NTIC\u2019s common stock is not as liquid as the stock of other public companies.\nAs of November 14, 2022, NTIC had 9,366,357 shares of common stock outstanding, 22.4% of which were beneficially owned by directors, executive officers, principal stockholders, and their respective affiliates. The stock of companies with a substantial amount of stock held by insiders is usually not as liquid as the stock of other public companies where insider ownership is not as concentrated. Thus, the trading market for shares of NTIC\u2019s common stock may not be as liquid as the stock of other public companies.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about NTIC\u2019s business, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding NTIC\u2019s common stock, the market price for NTIC\u2019s common stock and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for NTIC\u2019s common stock has been influenced by research or reports that industry or securities analysts publish about NTIC or its business. If one or more analysts who cover NTIC downgrade NTIC\u2019s common stock, the market price for NTIC\u2019s common stock would likely decline. If one or more cease coverage of NTIC or fail to regularly publish reports on NTIC, NTIC could lose visibility in the financial markets, which, in turn, could cause the market price or trading volume for NTIC\u2019s common stock to decline.\nOne of NTIC\u2019s principal stockholders beneficially owns a significant percentage of NTIC\u2019s outstanding common stock and is affiliated with NTIC\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer and, thus, may be able to influence matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, and could discourage or otherwise impede a transaction in which a third-party wishes to purchase NTIC\u2019s outstanding shares at a premium.\nAs of November 14, 2022, Inter Alia Holding Company, or Inter Alia, beneficially owned approximately 12.8% of NTIC\u2019s outstanding common stock. Inter Alia is an entity partially owned by G. Patrick Lynch, NTIC\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer and director, as well as two other members of the Lynch family. Mr. Lynch shares voting and dispositive power of shares of NTIC\u2019s common stock held by Inter Alia with the other owners. As a result of his share ownership through Inter Alia and his position as President and Chief Executive Officer and director of NTIC, Mr. Lynch may be able to influence the affairs and actions of NTIC, including matters requiring stockholder approval, such as the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. The interests of Mr. Lynch and Inter Alia may differ from the interests of NTIC\u2019s other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing, or deterring a change in control of NTIC, could deprive NTIC\u2019s stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale or merger of NTIC, and may negatively affect the market price of NTIC\u2019s common stock. Transactions that could be affected by this concentration of ownership include proxy contests, tender offers, mergers, or other purchases of common stock that could give stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for shares of NTIC\u2019s common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nClimate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires or flooding. Climate change may also cause water shortages, changes in rainfall and storm patterns, changes in sea levels and other negative weather and climate patterns. Such weather conditions could pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt operation of our supply chain and may impact operational costs.\nThe increasing global focus on climate change and the need for corporate change also may lead to new regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. Inconsistency of regulations in the countries in which we operate may affect the costs of compliance with such legal or regulatory requirements. Additionally, in the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiently, we may be subject to curtailment or reduced access to resources or experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations.\nIn addition, public company stockholders are increasingly sensitive to the climate change impacts and mitigation efforts of companies, are increasingly seeking enhanced disclosure on the risks, challenges, governance implications, and financial impacts of climate change faced by companies and are demanding that companies take a proactive approach to addressing perceived environmental risks, including risks associated with climate change, relating to their operations. In an effort to increase climate change disclosure, the SEC proposed climate disclosure rules that would require new climate-related disclosure in SEC filings, as described below. Adverse publicity or climate-related litigation that may result from such enhanced disclosure or stockholder perception could have a negative impact on our business.\nNew climate disclosure rules, if adopted by the SEC, may increase our costs and litigation risks, which would materially and adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition.\nDuring fiscal 2022, the SEC proposed new climate disclosure rules, which if adopted, would require new climate-related disclosure in SEC filings, including certain climate-related metrics and greenhouse gas emissions data, information about climate-related targets and goals, transition plans, if any, and extensive attestation requirements. In addition to requiring filers to quantify and disclose direct emissions data, the new rules also would require disclosure of climate impact arising from the operations and uses by the filer\u2019s business partners and contractors and end-users of the filer\u2019s products and/or services. We are currently assessing the impact of the new rules, if adopted as proposed, but at this time, we cannot predict the costs of implementation or any potential adverse impacts resulting from the new rules if adopted. However, we may incur increased costs relating to the assessment and disclosure of climate-related risks and increased litigation risks related to disclosures made pursuant to the new rules, either of which could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition.\nSevere weather could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nNTIC\u2019s business has been and could in the future be materially and adversely affected by severe weather. NTIC\u2019s customers, including in particular NTIC\u2019s oil and gas customers, may have operations located in parts of the southern United States or other places and may be adversely affected by hurricanes and tropical storms, resulting in reduced demand for NTIC\u2019s products and services or increased operating costs. Furthermore, NTIC\u2019s customers and raw material suppliers\u2019 operations have been and could in the future be adversely affected by such hurricanes and other extreme or seasonal weather conditions. For example, during fiscal year 2021, extreme weather caused supply chain disruptions and caused delays in receiving base resins. Adverse weather can also directly impede NTIC\u2019s operations. Repercussions of severe weather conditions may include:\n\u25cf\ncurtailment of services or reduced demand for products;\n\u25cf\nweather-related damage to facilities and equipment, resulting in suspension of operations;\n\u25cf\ninability to deliver equipment, personnel and products to job sites in accordance with contract schedules or increased transportation or other operating costs; and\n\u25cf\nloss of productivity.\nThese constraints could delay NTIC\u2019s operations and materially increase NTIC\u2019s operating and capital costs.\nNTIC may grow its business through additional joint ventures, subsidiaries, alliances, and acquisitions, which could be risky and harm its business.\nOne of NTIC\u2019s growth strategies may be to expand its business by entering into additional joint ventures and alliances and acquiring businesses, technologies, and products that complement or augment NTIC\u2019s existing products. The benefits of a joint venture, alliance, or acquisition may take more time than expected to develop, and NTIC cannot guarantee that any future joint ventures, alliances, or acquisitions will in fact produce the intended benefits. In addition, joint ventures, alliances, and acquisitions involve a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in assimilating the operations and products of a new joint venture or acquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies, cost savings, and revenue synergies;\n\u25cf\npotential loss of key employees or customers of the new joint venture or acquired business or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u25cf\nadverse impact on overall profitability if the new joint venture or acquired business does not achieve the financial results projected in NTIC\u2019s valuation models;\n\u25cf\nreallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives and/or an increase in NTIC\u2019s leverage and debt service requirements to pay the joint venture capital contribution or the acquisition purchase price, which could in turn restrict NTIC\u2019s ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of NTIC\u2019s business strategy;\n\u25cf\ninaccurate assessment of undisclosed, contingent, or other liabilities or problems and unanticipated costs associated with the new joint venture or acquisition; and\n\u25cf\nincorrect estimates made in the accounting for acquisitions, occurrence of non-recurring charges, and write-off of significant amounts of goodwill that could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s operating results.\nNTIC\u2019s ability to grow through joint ventures, alliances, and acquisitions will depend, in part, on the availability of suitable opportunities at an acceptable cost, NTIC\u2019s ability to compete effectively for these opportunities, and the availability of capital to complete such transactions.\nNTIC relies on its management information systems for inventory management, distribution, and other functions. If these information systems fail to adequately perform these functions or if NTIC experiences an interruption in their operation, NTIC\u2019s business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe efficient operation of NTIC\u2019s business is dependent on its management information systems. NTIC relies on its management information systems to effectively manage accounting and financial functions; manage order entry, order fulfillment, and inventory replenishment processes; and to maintain its research and development data. The failure of management information systems to perform as anticipated could disrupt NTIC\u2019s business and product development and could result in decreased sales, causing NTIC\u2019s business and operating results to suffer. In addition, NTIC\u2019s management information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural or man-made disasters, including terrorist attacks, attacks by computer viruses or hackers, power loss to computer systems, Internet outages, and telecommunications or data network failure. Any such interruption could adversely affect NTIC\u2019s business and operating results.\nNTIC\u2019s business could be negatively impacted by cyber security threats.\nIn the ordinary course of NTIC\u2019s business, NTIC uses its management information systems to store and access proprietary business information. NTIC faces various cyber security threats, including cyber security attacks to its information technology infrastructure and attempts by others to gain access to its proprietary or sensitive information. The procedures and controls NTIC uses to monitor these threats and mitigate its exposure may not be sufficient to prevent cyber security incidents. The result of these incidents could include disrupted operations, lost opportunities, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased costs arising from the implementation of additional security protective measures, litigation, and reputational damage. Any remedial costs or other liabilities related to cyber security incidents may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Additionally, on February 9, 2022, the SEC proposed new rules related to cyber security risk management, which may increase NTIC\u2019s regulatory burden and cost of compliance related to cyber security threats.\nNTIC\u2019s quarterly results are typically unpredictable and subject to variation.\nNTIC\u2019s quarterly operating results vary from quarter to quarter for a variety of reasons. For example, NTIC\u2019s quarterly sales to joint ventures can be affected by individual orders to joint ventures. Because of the typical size of individual orders to joint ventures and the overall size of NTIC\u2019s net sales to joint ventures, the timing of one or more orders can materially affect NTIC\u2019s quarterly sales to joint ventures and the comparisons to prior year quarters. In addition, because of the typical size of individual orders and the overall size of NTIC\u2019s net sales derived from sales of Natur-Tec\u00ae products, the timing of one or more orders can materially affect NTIC\u2019s quarterly sales of Natur-Tec\u00ae products and the comparisons to prior year quarters. Furthermore, since ZERUST\u00ae products for the oil and gas industry typically carry higher margins than other traditional ZERUST\u00ae products, the amount of sales of ZERUST\u00ae products for the oil and gas industry typically affects NTIC\u2019s overall margins. Such variability in operating results makes the prediction of NTIC\u2019s net sales, earnings, and other operating results for each quarter difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly operating results. NTIC\u2019s quarterly results have been and, in the future, may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors.\nNTIC\u2019s business is subject to a number of other miscellaneous risks that may adversely affect NTIC\u2019s operating results, financial condition, or business.\nNTIC\u2019s business is subject to a number of other miscellaneous risks that may adversely affect NTIC\u2019s operating results, and financial condition, such as natural or man-made disasters, an unexpected business loss of supply due to a force majeure event or global pandemics that may result in shortages of raw materials, higher commodity costs, an increase in insurance premiums, and other adverse effects on NTIC\u2019s business; the continued threat of terrorist acts and war that may result in heightened security and higher costs for import and export shipments of components or finished goods; and the ability of NTIC\u2019s management to adapt to unplanned events.", "PERMNO": 77488, "SIC": 2890, "TIC": "NTIC"}
