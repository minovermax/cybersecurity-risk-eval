{"cik": "1091907", "company": "WORLD WRESTLING ENTERTAINMENTINC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThere are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our business that could adversely affect our operating performance and financial condition. Set forth below are descriptions of those risks and uncertainties that we currently believe to be material, but the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that could affect our business. See the discussion under \u201cCautionary Statement for Purposes of the \u2018Safe Harbor\u2019 Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\u201d in Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Business\nThe ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic may continue to negatively affect world economies as well as our industry, business and results of operations.\nThe global spread of the coronavirus, including its current and future variants (COVID-19), and the various attempts to contain it have resulted and likely will continue to result in restrictions, postponements and cancellations of various sports and other events and has required and likely will continue to require us to cancel, postpone, relocate and/or modify certain of our live events. We do not expect insurance to cover any portion of this lost business. The pandemic has also continued to create significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption, the full extent of which will depend on numerous evolving factors that we can neither predict nor control\nincluding the pandemic\u2019s duration, the impact of current and future COVID-19 variants and related governmental, business and individual responses. As a result, we have been required to alter certain aspects of our operations beyond our live events. We are unable to predict future attendance at our live events, even when the pandemic risks and restrictions have lessened. We have also taken measures to protect the health and well-being of our employees and our talent and other vendors. Our workforce has spent a significant amount of time working from home. Remote access could heighten operational risks, including cybersecurity risks. Travel has been curtailed. We have greatly increased our cleaning and health check protocols, which increase related expenditures. We have also implemented certain cash conserving measures, which were in effect for various time periods during 2020, including pausing our stock repurchase program and certain capital expenditures; containing employment costs through salary reductions and furloughs; containing certain third party vendor costs; and drawing under our revolving credit facility, which has since been repaid. No assurances can be provided that COVID-19 will not in the future require changes to our operations and/or renewed cash conserving measures.\nWe believe our partners\u2019 operations have also been affected including, without limitation, in their sales of advertising. Widely reported supply constraints on inflation have occurred and may be ongoing into the foreseeable future. Depending on the severity and persistence of the pandemic and resulting impacts including, without limitation, these supply constraints and inflationary pressures, we could see a material impact on our customers\u2019 demand, or ability to pay (including an impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable), for our goods and services. We will continue actively to monitor the issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and related factors and may take further actions that alter our business operations as required by applicable governmental authorities and/or that we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, talent, customers, partners and stockholders. There can be no assurance that we will be entirely successful in these endeavors, which could result in inadvertent noncompliance with applicable law. The COVID-19 pandemic also could result in heightened litigation risks relating to personal injury or death and/or increased levels of commercial litigation. Any of the foregoing could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur failure to maintain or renew key agreements could adversely affect our ability to distribute our media content, WWE Network, our films and/or other of our goods and services, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur media content is distributed by cable, satellite and broadcast television networks and digital platforms around the globe. As detailed below, we have depended on and, in international markets will continue to depend on, third parties for many aspects of the operation and distribution of WWE Network. Our films are generally also distributed by other, more established film companies. Because a large portion of our revenues are generated, directly and indirectly, from this distribution, any failure to maintain (such as due to a breach or alleged breach by either party) or renew arrangements with distributors and platforms, the failure of distributors or platforms to continue to provide services to us or the failure to enter into new distribution opportunities on terms favorable to us could adversely affect our financial outlook, liquidity, business and operating results. We regularly engage in negotiations relating to substantial agreements covering the distribution of our media content by carriers located in the United States and abroad. We have substantial relationships with NBCU, which carries RAW and NXT through its cable networks. WWE Network is distributed exclusively via Peacock in the domestic market. Fox Network carries SmackDown. We also have an important partnership with the General Entertainment Authority of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. These relationships are expected to continue to constitute a significant percentage of our revenues. Many of our other goods and services, such as our toys and video games are manufactured and sold by other parties under licenses of our intellectual property or distribution agreements. Our inability for any of the reasons set forth in these Risk Factors to enter into, maintain and/or renew or replace, as the case may be, these agreements on terms favorable to us could adversely affect our financial outlook, liquidity, business and/or operating results.\nOur failure to compete effectively in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive media landscape could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe manner in which audio/media content is distributed and viewed is constantly changing, and consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. Changes in technology require Company resources including personnel, capital and operating expenses. Conversely, technology changes have also decreased the cost of video production and distribution for certain programmers (such as through social media), which lowers the barriers to entry and increases the competition for viewership and revenues. While we attempt to distribute our programming across all platforms, our failure to continue to do so effectively (including, for example only, our emphasizing a distribution platform that in time lessens in importance or becomes obsolete or our loss of, or other inability to procure, carriage on an important platform) could adversely affect our operating results. If other providers of video programming address the changes in consumer viewing habits in a manner that is better able to meet content distributor and consumer needs and expectations, our business could be adversely affected. Cable and broadcast television distribution constitutes a large part of our revenues. The number of subscribers and ratings of television networks and advertising revenues in general have been reported as being impacted by viewers moving to alternative media content providers, a process known as \u201ccord cutting\u201d and \u201ccord shaving\u201d. Developments in technology may have added, and may continue to add, to this shift as consumers\u2019 expectations relative to the availability of video content on demand, their willingness to pay to access content and their tolerance for commercial interruptions evolve. Many well-funded digital companies (such as Apple, Facebook, YouTube, Netflix, Amazon and Hulu) have been competing with the traditional television business model and, while it has been widely reported that they are paying significant amounts for media content, it is not clear that these digital distributors will replace the importance (in terms of money paid for content, viewer penetration and other factors) of television distribution to media content owners such as WWE. Our media partners\u2019 businesses are affected by their sale of advertising and\nsubscriptions for their services. If they are unable to sell advertising and/or subscriptions either with regard to WWE programming specifically (such as, by way of example and without limitation, due to a decline in the popularity of our programming and/or brand) or all of their programing generally (such as, by way of example and without limitation, due to a move of consumers away from a platform carrying our programming), it could adversely affect our operating results.\nIf, for any number of reasons, we are unable to continue to develop and monetize WWE Network successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nNeed to Attract, Retain and Replace Fans. The markets for entertainment video are intensely competitive and include many subscription, transactional and ad-supported models and vast amounts of pirated materials, all of which capture segments of the entertainment video market. These markets have been and are expected to continue to be subject to rapid changes, and new technologies and evolving business models are developing at a fast pace. In domestic markets, WWE Network is carried exclusively as a part of Peacock. Our ability to attract and retain fans for WWE Network internationally and for Peacock domestically will depend in part on our ability to provide consistent high-quality content and a high level of service that is perceived as a good value for the consumer\u2019s entertainment dollars in the face of this intense competition. Our failure to do so could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nSignificant Ongoing Costs. WWE Network has and will continue to require significant content cost and operating costs. Any and all such costs, if not more than offset by revenues from WWE Network, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nReliance on Partners to Offer our Content. Fans have the ability to receive streaming WWE content through their PCs, Macs and other Internet-connected devices, including game consoles and mobile devices, such as tablets and mobile phones as well as smart televisions and Blu-Ray players. We intend to continue to offer WWE Network in international markets through available platforms and partners. As a result, we rely on outside partners to develop, supply and maintain technology and infrastructure necessary to deliver our content and interact with the user. If we (in international markets) or Peacock (in the domestic market) are not successful in maintaining, renewing and/or replacing this technology or if we or Peacock are not successful in entering into and maintaining relationships with platform providers, if we or our partners (including Peacock) encounter technological, licensing or other impediments to streaming our content, or if viewers either upgrade existing platforms or migrate to new platforms in such a way that we or our partners (including Peacock) do not or cannot deliver through the new or upgraded platform, our ability to reach our fans and monetize our content successfully could be adversely impacted. Certain platforms, such as Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Hulu, offer their owned or licensed content and, therefore, may be disincentivized to promote and deliver our content at the same level as provided for their content.\nWe and our business partners face various risks relating to our computer systems, content delivery and online operations, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition or our results of operations.\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our fans will depend on the reliable performance of computer and information systems and other technologies, including technology systems used in connection with the production and distribution of our programming and those of third-parties (including Peacock) with whom we partner in our operations. Interruptions in these systems, or with the Internet in general whether due to fault by any party or due to weather, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, power loss or other force majeure type events, could make our content unavailable or degraded. These service disruptions or failures could be prolonged. Delivery of video programming over the Internet is done through a series of carriers with switch-overs between carriers. Television delivery is extremely complex and includes satellite, fiberoptic cable, over-the-air delivery and other means. Any point of failure in this distribution chain would cause a disruption or degradation of our signal. Service disruption or degradation for any of the foregoing reasons could diminish the overall attractiveness of our content. We do not carry insurance that would cover us in the event of many types of business interruption that could occur.\nThe Company and its partners face the risk of a security breach or disruption, whether through external cyber-attack/intrusion or from persons with access to systems inside the organization. These risks include, without limitation, computer viruses (including worms, malware, ransomware and other destructive or disruptive software or denial of service attacks), physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions and any delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse, theft or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable company or customer data or information. The Company commits significant personnel and financial resources to maintain the security of its systems, including implementing various measures to monitor and manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, and to plan for the mitigation of losses if such breach or disruption were to occur. There can be no assurance that these security efforts will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging or that the Company would be promptly aware of them or able to mitigate damages from them. The Company also utilizes third party service providers in several aspects of its operations, and these third parties are also subject to risks of security breach or disruption. The Company is not able to assure the effectiveness of security among our service providers. The Company and certain of its third-party service providers receive personal information through web services. This information is generally subject to applicable privacy policies. Personal information received by our service providers includes credit card information in certain instances. The Company expends significant effort to ensure compliance with its privacy policy and to ensure that our service providers safeguard credit card information\nincluding contractually requiring those providers to remain compliant with applicable PCI Data Security Standards. However, a significant security breach or other disruption involving the systems of the Company or one or more of its service providers could disrupt the proper functioning of these systems and therefore the Company's operations (for which we likely will not carry sufficient insurance); result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information; require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that could result (if, in fact, they can be remedied), and subject the Company to litigation or damage to its reputation. Any or all of these could have a negative impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur businesses entail certain risks relating to privacy norms and regulations.\nWe and our business partners collect certain data supplied by our fans. We utilize this data in various ways including our marketing efforts. We face complex legal obligations domestically and internationally regarding the manner in which we treat and use such information, including, without limitation, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d) and the California Consumer Privacy Act, updated by the California Privacy Rights Act which will go into effect on January 1, 2023. These legal obligations carry substantial monetary penalties if breached. Unintentional noncompliance by us or our partners of these regulations could have an adverse effect on our business. If we were to disclose or use data about our fans in a manner that is objectionable to them or is contrary to applicable law, our business reputation could be adversely affected and it could result in litigation, either or both of which could impact our operating results. In addition, our operations in international markets expose us to multiple regulatory frameworks and societal norms, the complexity of which may result in unintentional noncompliance which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the Internet to access our programming, including laws and/or court decisions that have the effect of limiting Internet neutrality, could limit the demand for our content via Peacock and other online platforms. The FCC had adopted an \u201cOpen Internet\u201d Report and Order and accompanying rules, which addressed various practices of broadband Internet access providers. Those rules, in substantial part, were reversed by the FCC \u201cRestoring Internet Freedom\u201d Declaratory Ruling, Report and Order released in 2018, and replaced by what the FCC refers to as a \u201clight-touch regulatory framework,\u201d including modified customer transparency requirements. Petitions for review of the FCC\u2019s rulings were filed by multiple parties. In October 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (\u201cD.C. Circuit\u201d) largely affirmed the FCC\u2019s 2018 Restoring Internet Freedom decision, though reversed the blanket preemption adopted by the FCC of state and local requirements that are inconsistent with FCC\u2019s deregulatory approach and remanded to the FCC to further consider three discrete issues. The FCC concluded in an order on remand that there was no basis to alter its conclusions in the Restoring Internet Freedom Order. Petitions for reconsideration of the FCC order on remand remain pending, and the FCC has asked the D.C. Circuit to refrain from hearing any challenges to its order on remand, while it considers the pending petitions. Following the FCC\u2019s repeal of its Open Internet rules, California, and a number of other states enacted or introduced their own versions of Open Internet-type laws. Following judicial challenge of the California law in Federal Court by a group of service provider associations and the district court\u2019s denial of a preliminary injunction to block enforcement of the California law, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of an injunction and ruled, agreeing with the D.C. Circuit\u2019s preemption analysis, that the FCC\u2019s adoption of its Restoring Internet Freedom order did not preempt the California law. The 9th Circuit decision, which is subject to further review and appeal and may or may not be followed in other U.S. Courts of Appeal, nonetheless appears to remove an impediment to the adoption and implementation of Open Internet-type laws by the states. To the extent that network operators engage in discriminatory practices, our business could be adversely impacted. As we continue to expand internationally, government regulation concerning the Internet, and in particular, net neutrality, may be nascent or non-existent. Within such a regulatory environment, due to the political and economic power of local network operators, who may have interests that do not align with ours, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business. To the extent that network operators in international markets implement usage based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers (such as through tiered access or pricing), due to the heavy bandwidth use of audio/visual content, we could incur greater operating expenses and our business could be negatively impacted.\nOur failure to continue to build and maintain our brand of entertainment could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe must continue to build and maintain our strong brand identity to attract and retain fans who have a number of entertainment choices. The creation, marketing and distribution of live events, programming and films that our fans value and enjoy is at the core of our business. The production of compelling live, televised, streamed and film content is critical to our ability to generate revenues across our media platforms and product outlets. Also important are effective consumer communications, such as marketing, customer service and public relations. The role of social media by fans and by us is an important factor in our brand perception. If our efforts to create compelling services and goods and/or otherwise promote and maintain our brand, services and merchandise are not successful, our ability to attract and retain fans may be adversely affected. Such a result would likely lead to a decline in our television ratings, attendance\nat our live events post-pandemic, and/or otherwise impact our sales of goods and services, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nOur failure to retain or continue to recruit key performers could lead to a decline in the appeal of our storylines and the popularity of our brand of entertainment, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur success depends, in large part, upon our ability to recruit, train and retain athletic performers who have the physical presence, acting ability and charisma to portray characters in our live events, programming and films. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to identify and train these performers. Additionally, throughout our history, performers from time to time have stopped working for us for any number of reasons, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain our current performers either during the terms of their contracts or when their contracts expire. Our failure to attract and retain key performers, an increase in the costs required to attract and retain such performers, or a serious or untimely injury to, or the death of, or unexpected or premature loss or retirement for any reason of, any of our key performers could lead to a decline in the appeal of our storylines and the popularity of our brand of entertainment. Scheduling conflicts for talent services may also affect certain productions. Any of the foregoing issues could adversely affect our operating results.\nA decline in the popularity of our brand of sports entertainment, including as a result of changes in the social and political climate, could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are affected by consumer tastes and entertainment trends, which are unpredictable and subject to change and may be affected by changes in the social and political climate. Our programming is created to evoke a passionate response from our fans. Changes in our fans\u2019 tastes or a material change in the perceptions of our business partners, including our distributors, sponsors and licensees, whether as a result of the social and political climate or otherwise, could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe unexpected loss of the services of Vincent K. McMahon could adversely affect our ability to create popular characters and creative storylines or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results.\nIn addition to serving as Chairman of our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. McMahon leads the creative team that develops the storylines and the characters for our programming (including our television, WWE Network and other programming) and live events. The loss of Mr. McMahon due to unexpected retirement, disability, death or other unexpected termination for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our ability to create popular characters and creative storylines or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results.\nChanges in the regulatory atmosphere and related private sector initiatives could adversely affect our businesses.\nProduction of video programming by independent producers is generally not directly regulated by the federal or state governments in the United States. SmackDown is on broadcast television on the Fox Network, and certain of our programming is distributed on-demand via cable and satellite operators. We are responsible, directly or indirectly, for compliance with certain additional FCC regulations and statutory requirements applicable to programming distributed over television broadcast stations, cable and satellite, as well as for certain of our programming distributed via online platforms that has been televised via broadcast television, cable or satellite. Any failure to remain in compliance with these requirements could expose us to substantial costs and adverse publicity which could impact our operating results. Changes in FCC regulations, and the ongoing reallocation of satellite spectrum for \u201c5G\u201d next generation wireless broadband use, could impact the availability of satellite transmission spectrum for video programming distribution, which could increase the transmission costs of certain of our programming and/or affect transmission quality and reliability. The markets for programming in the United States and internationally may be substantially affected by government regulations applicable to, as well as social and political influences on, television stations and networks. We voluntarily designate the suitability of each of our television and WWE Network programs using standard industry ratings. Domestic and foreign governmental and private-sector initiatives relating to the production and distribution of video programming are announced from time to time. Compliance by our licensees of these initiatives and/or their noncompliance of governmental policies could restrict our program distribution and adversely affect our levels of viewership, result in adverse publicity and/or otherwise impact our operating results.\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive, rapidly changing and increasingly fragmented, and we may not be able to compete effectively, especially against competitors with greater financial resources or marketplace presence, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe face competition for our audiences from professional and college sports, as well as other forms of live and televised, streamed and filmed entertainment and other leisure activities in a rapidly changing and increasingly fragmented marketplace. For the sale of our consumer products, we compete with entertainment companies, professional and college sports leagues and other makers of branded apparel and merchandise. Many of the companies with whom we compete have substantially greater financial resources than we do. Other new and existing professional wrestling leagues also compete with our goods and services. Our failure to compete effectively\ncould result in a significant loss of viewers, subscribers, venues, distribution channels or performers and fewer entertainment and advertising dollars spent on our form of sports entertainment, any of which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe face uncertainties associated with international markets, which could adversely affect our operating results and impair our business strategy.\nWe are regularly negotiating and entering into new agreements and renewals and extensions of existing agreements for our products and services in international markets. WWE Network is available in most international markets. In 2018, WWE embarked on an important long-term partnership with the General Entertainment Authority of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for, among other things, a series of live events in that region. We periodically held talent tryouts overseas pre-pandemic and have a training facility in the United Kingdom. Cultural norms and regulatory frameworks vary in the markets in which we operate and our products' nonconformance to local norms or applicable law, regulations or licensing requirements could interrupt our operations or affect our sales, viewership and success in the markets. Our production of live events overseas in non-pandemic times subjects us to numerous risks involved in foreign travel and operations and also subjects us to local norms and complex regulations (including visa obligations). In addition, these live events and the licensing and/or sale of our goods and services in international markets expose us to some degree of currency risk. International operations may be subject to political instability inherent in varying degrees in those markets, terrorism and wars. Other risks relating to foreign operations include difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations, management distraction, new and different sources of competition, compliance with U.S. and international laws relating to, among other things, bribery, less favorable foreign intellectual property laws, laws relating to repatriation of funds, lower levels of Internet availability, complexity of VAT and other local tax laws, and data protection, consumer protection, censorship, licensing and other regulatory matters as well as possible reputational risks. The GDPR applies to certain of our operations, and its provisions are far reaching. Noncompliance with GDPR could result in significant fines, operational issues and/or harm to reputation. The United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal of its membership from the European Union (referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) could complicate international matters including financial, legal, tax and trade implications. We have committed significant financial and personnel resources toward compliance. No assurances can be provided that our efforts will be successful in this regard. These risks could adversely affect our operating results and impair our ability to pursue our business strategy as it relates to international markets, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe may be prohibited from promoting and conducting our live events if we do not comply with applicable regulations, which could lead to a decline in the various revenue streams generated from our live events, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nIn some United States and foreign jurisdictions, athletic commissions and other applicable regulatory agencies require us to obtain licenses for promoters, medical clearances and/or other permits or licenses for performers and/or permits for events in order for us to promote and conduct our live events. Foreign jurisdictions require visas for personnel and talent at international live events. In international markets, third party promoters generally oversee permitting and regulatory matters. In the event that we fail to comply with the regulations of a particular jurisdiction, whether through our acts or omissions or those of our third-party promoters, we may be prohibited from promoting and conducting our live events in that jurisdiction. In non-pandemic times, the inability to present our live events in jurisdiction(s), in addition to the lost revenues and expenses of the missed event(s), could lead to a decline in various revenue streams in such jurisdiction(s), which could adversely affect our operating results.\nBecause we depend upon our intellectual property rights, our inability to protect those rights, or our infringement of others\u2019 intellectual property rights, could adversely affect our business.\nIntellectual property is material to all aspects of our business. We have a large portfolio of registered and unregistered trademarks, service marks, copyrighted material and characters, trade names and other intellectual property rights worldwide. We also own a large number of Internet website domain names and operate a network of developed, content-based sites, which facilitate and contribute to the exploitation of our intellectual property worldwide. We expend substantial cost and effort in an attempt to maintain and protect this intellectual property and to maintain compliance with other parties\u2019 intellectual property. Our failure to curtail piracy, infringement or other unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights effectively, or our infringement of others\u2019 intellectual property rights, could result in litigation, damage our brand or adversely affect our relationships with the companies that distribute our goods and services, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Many companies devote significant resources on patents relating to various aspects of streaming services. For example, there are numerous patents that broadly claim means and methods of conducting business on the Internet, and we and/or our service providers have from time to time been named in lawsuits and other claims alleging violations of patents in connection with various aspects of our business. Defending against intellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit, can result in costly litigation and diversion of personnel. These types of claims could result in our inability to use technology and could significantly impact the monetization of our intellectual property.\nOur distribution mechanisms for our goods and services are increasingly complex across various distribution platforms, various geographical areas and timing windows.\nOur inadvertent grant of inconsistent rights to our intellectual property, goods and/or services or allegations of such inconsistent grants could result in claims of breach of our distribution agreements or licenses and/or result in litigation which could adversely impact our operations.\nWe could incur substantial liability relating to accidents or injuries (or insurance relating thereto) arising out of our physically demanding events.\nWe hold numerous live events each year. This schedule exposes our performers and our employees who are involved in the production of those events to the risk of travel and performance-related accidents, the consequences of which are not fully covered by insurance. The physical nature of our events exposes our performers to the risk of serious injury or death. Although our performers, as independent contractors, are responsible for maintaining their own health, disability and life insurance, we self-insure medical costs for our performers for injuries that they incur while training and performing. We self-insure a substantial portion of any other liability that we could incur relating to such injuries. In certain states, notably California and New York, legislative changes have been enacted or are contemplated that draw into question our ability to treat our talent as independent contractors in those states. The impact to the Company of these initiatives is unknown. If ultimately required, worker\u2019s compensation insurance for our talent or other aspects of their treatment as employees in those states could add expense to, or otherwise alter, our operations, which could affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. Liability to us resulting from any death or serious injury sustained by one of our performers while performing, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur live events entail other risks inherent in public live events, which could lead to disruptions of our business as well as liability to other parties, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe hold numerous large live events each year, both domestically and internationally. Certain risks are inherent in events of the type we perform as well as the travel to and from them, and we are required to expend substantial resources on safety matters such as security. Risks of travel and large live events include air and land travel interruption or accidents, the spread of infectious disease (such as COVID-19) or other illness, injuries resulting from building problems, pyrotechnics or other equipment malfunction, terrorism or other violence, local labor strikes and other force majeure type events. These issues could result in personal injuries or deaths, canceled events and other disruptions to our business for which our business interruption insurance may be insufficient or nonexistent. Any of these occurrences also could result in liability to other parties for which we may not have insurance. Any of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nWe could face a variety of risks if we expand into other new and complementary businesses and/or make certain investments or acquisitions.\nWe have entered into new or complementary businesses and made equity and debt investments in other companies in the past and plan to continue to do so in the future. We may also enter into business combination transactions, make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships, joint ventures or alliances. Risks of this expansion and/or these investments and transactions may include, among other risks: unanticipated liabilities or contingencies including counter-party risks such as inadvertent breaches or collection difficulties; potential diversion of management\u2019s attention and other resources, including available cash, from our existing businesses; loss on investments due to poor performance by the business invested in; inability to integrate a new business successfully; revaluations of debt and equity investments as well as market, credit and interest-rate risks (any of which could result in impairment charges and other costs); competition from other companies with more experience in such businesses; and possible additional regulatory requirements and compliance costs, all of which could affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur accounts receivable relate principally to a limited number of distributors, licensees, and other partners increasing our exposure to bad debts and counter-party risk which could potentially have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSubstantial portions of our accounts receivable are from distributors of our programming; hosts/promoters of our live events (pre-pandemic); and licensees who produce consumer products containing our intellectual property. The concentration of our accounts receivable across a limited number of parties subjects us to individual counter-party and credit risk as these parties may breach our agreement, claim that we have breached the agreement, become insolvent and/or declare bankruptcy, delaying or reducing our collection of receivables or rendering collection impossible altogether. Certain of the parties are located overseas which may make collection efforts more difficult (including due to increased legal uncertainty) and, at times, collections may be economically unfeasible. Adverse changes in general economic conditions and/or contraction in global credit markets could precipitate liquidity problems among our\ndebtors. This could increase our exposure to losses from bad debts and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are inherent risks relating to our new leased corporate headquarters and media production facilities.\nWe have signed a lease for space in downtown Stamford, Connecticut, in which we plan to house substantially all our operations, including our corporate headquarters and media production facilities. The scope of this project has changed somewhat, and the move is now expected to begin in late 2022. The buildout of this space will involve substantial capital expenditure, and it could take longer, and cost more, than currently expected. Significant delays and/or cost overruns would result in higher expenditures and could be disruptive of operations, any of which could have a negative impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, it is possible that, once built, the space may prove to be less conducive to our operations than is currently anticipated, resulting in operational inefficiencies or similar difficulties that could prove difficult or impossible to remediate and result in an adverse impact on the our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe could incur substantial liabilities if litigation is resolved unfavorably.\nIn our business, we become subject to various complaints and litigation matters. By its nature, the outcome of litigation is difficult to assess and quantify, and its continuing defense is costly. Any adverse judgment or settlement could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nA change in tax laws in key jurisdictions could materially increase our tax expense.\nWe are subject to federal, state and international tax laws and regulations. Changes to tax laws and regulations, or in the interpretation of such laws and regulations, could increase our effective tax rate, adversely affecting our operating results. The Company uses its best judgment in determining these tax obligations. However, developments such as a challenge by a taxing authority, a change in the Company\u2019s ability to utilize tax benefits, such as carryforwards and/or credits, or a deviation from other tax-related assumptions may impact our financial results. In this connection, the Company anticipates that it will continue to avail itself of certain state content production and infrastructure tax incentives and anticipates receiving tax credits from the new headquarters buildout. Any loss of these credits or inability of the Company to utilize these credits as anticipated could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe continue to face certain risks relating to our feature film business, which could result in asset impairment charges, adversely affecting our financial condition or our results of operations.\nWhile lower than they were at historical levels, we still have capitalized film costs on our balance sheet. The accounting for our film business in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles entails significant judgment to develop estimates of expected future revenues from films. If expected revenue from one or more of our films does not materialize because audience demand does not meet expectations, our estimated revenues may not be sufficient to recoup our investment in the film. If actual revenues are lower than our estimated revenues or if costs are higher than expected, we are required to record an impairment charge and write down the capitalized costs of the film. No assurance can be given that we will not record impairment charges in any periods.\nRisks Related to Markets Generally\nA decline in general economic conditions or disruption of financial markets, including any resulting from COVID-19, may, among other things, reduce the discretionary income of consumers or erode advertising markets, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are affected by general economic conditions, including consumers\u2019 disposable income, which has a direct material impact on the demand for entertainment and leisure activities. Declines in general economic conditions (such as, without limitation, a continuing deterioration due to COVID-19) could reduce the level of discretionary income that our fans and potential fans have to spend on our live events, programming, films and consumer products, which could adversely affect our revenues. Volatility and disruption of financial markets could limit the ability of our sponsors, licensees and distributors to obtain adequate financing to maintain operations and result in a decrease in sales volume that could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Inflation, which has historically not had a material impact on the Company, is reported over the past year to be increasing materially and it could affect our customers and business partners\u2019 purchases from, and sales to, us, adversely affecting our revenues and/or costs of doing business. Our television partners derive revenues from the sale of advertising. We also sell advertising directly on our website and, depending upon the distribution methods used to monetize additional content, we may have additional advertising to sell. We sell sponsorship packages to our live events and certain other of our services, and we will continue to participate in such sponsorship sales\nwith Peacock on its platforms. Continued softness in the advertising markets due to a weak economic environment, the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, could adversely affect our revenues or the financial viability of our distributors.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nServicing our debt may require a significant amount of cash, and we could have insufficient cash flow from operations or lack of access to sources of financing to meet these obligations and/or our other liquidity needs.\nOur total consolidated debt, including the $215.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% convertible senior notes due 2023 (the \"Convertible Notes\"), is significant. We also have availability under our $200.0 million revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\"). Through certain of our subsidiaries, the Company also has in place a real estate mortgage in the principal amount of $21.7 million secured by the related real estate (the \u201cAsset-Backed Facilities\u201d).\nWe believe we have sufficient liquidity for at least the next twelve months for our needs (including the payment of our dividend). However, our ability to make scheduled principal and interest payments on the Convertible Notes and under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Asset-Backed Facilities and any other indebtedness that may be outstanding at the time will depend on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors which may be beyond our control, including the items described elsewhere in these Risk Factors. It is possible our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and provide for all our other uses of cash including capital and operating expenditures and paying our dividend. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we could be required to adopt one or more alternatives which, assuming they are, in fact, available, could be onerous, dilutive or otherwise affect our operations and/or the market price of our Common Stock. Such alternatives could include, for example, substantially reducing our cost structure, selling assets, reducing or eliminating our dividend, and/or obtaining additional debt or equity financing. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities on desirable terms, or at all, due to our then existing financial condition, market conditions, regulatory matters or contractual obligations (including, for example, any restrictions under our Revolving Credit Facility or other credit agreement or debt instruments that may exist at that time). Any failure to make a required payment under our indebtedness may constitute a default under that indebtedness and under other indebtedness due to cross-default provisions and could trigger acceleration clauses causing the obligations to become immediately due and payable. The occurrence of one or more of these risks could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash and/or shares, such as the Company\u2019s convertible notes, could have a material effect on our diluted earnings per share.\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity (\u201cASU 2020-06\u201d). The Company intends to adopt the amendments on January 1, 2022. Once adopted, the convertible notes of the Company will be subject to the \u201cif-converted\u201d method for calculating diluted earnings per share. Under the \u201cif-converted\u201d method, diluted earnings per share will be calculated assuming that all of the convertible notes were converted solely into shares of common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive. This new method of calculating earnings per share may adversely affect our diluted earnings per share.\nRisks Related to Our Stock Ownership\nFailure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock.\nWe believe that the price of our stock generally reflects certain market expectations for our future operating results. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including as a result of any of the events, conditions and/or circumstances set forth in these Risk Factors, could cause the market price of our stock to decline significantly.\nThrough his beneficial ownership of a majority of our Class B common stock, Mr. McMahon can exercise control over our affairs, and his interests may conflict with the holders of our Class A common stock.\nWe have Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The holders of Class A common stock generally have rights identical to holders of Class B common stock, except that holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share, and holders of Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share. Holders of both classes of common stock generally will vote together as a single class on all matters presented to stockholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable Delaware law.\nA substantial majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Class B common stock is owned beneficially by Vincent K. McMahon and, as a result, he controls a majority of the voting power of our common stock and can effectively exercise control over our affairs. His interest could conflict with the holders of our Class A common stock. McMahon\u2019s voting control could discourage or\npreclude others from initiating potential mergers, takeovers or other change of control transactions. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nOur dividend is affected by a number of factors, and we cannot provide any guaranty that we will continue to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program.\nOur Board of Directors regularly evaluates the Company\u2019s Common Stock dividend policy and determines the dividend rate each quarter. The level of dividends, if any, will continue to be influenced by many factors, including, among other things, our liquidity and historical and projected cash flow, our strategic plan (including alternative uses of capital), our financial results and condition, contractual and legal restrictions on the payment of dividends (including under our revolving credit facility), general economic and competitive conditions and such other factors as our Board of Directors may consider relevant from time to time. All of these factors are subject to the various contingencies listed in the other Risk Factors included in this Form 10-K. We cannot assure our stockholders that dividends will be paid in the future, or that, if paid, dividends will be at the same amount or with the same frequency as in the past. Any reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nIn February 2019, the Company announced a $500 million stock repurchase program pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase shares of our common stock at management\u2019s discretion and subject to applicable laws. We have repurchased approximately $249 million of common stock to date and all share repurchases have been retired. This program is subject to the same risk factors as those influencing our dividend. The share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any set dollar amount or number of shares and may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time, and it was suspended throughout 2020, largely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, no assurances can be provided as to the level of repurchases or the completion of this repurchase program at any specific time or at all. The suspension or termination of our share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Additionally, the existence of a share repurchase program could cause the market price of our common stock to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program. As a result, any repurchase program may not ultimately result in enhanced value to our stockholders and may not prove to be the best use of our cash resources.\nA substantial number of shares are eligible for sale by Mr. McMahon and members of his family or trusts established for their benefit, and the sale of those shares could lower our stock price.\nAll of the issued and outstanding shares of Class B common stock are held by Vincent McMahon and other members of his family including certain trusts set up for family members. Sales of substantial amounts of these shares, or the perception that such sales could occur, may lower the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock. If any sales or transfers of Class B common stock are made to persons outside of the McMahon family, the shares automatically convert into Class A common stock.\nThe market for our Class A common stock is volatile.\nThe price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our direct control, including our operating results (especially where different from the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community), market volatility in general and short interest in our stock. Given the dynamic nature of our business and all other factors that limit the predictability of the future, any of our forecasts, outlook or other forward-looking statements could differ materially from actual results which could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 87356, "SIC": 7812, "TIC": "WWE"}
