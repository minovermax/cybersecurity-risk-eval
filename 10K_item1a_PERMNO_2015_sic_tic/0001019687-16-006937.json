{"cik": "704562", "company": "PEREGRINE PHARMACEUTICALS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-07-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\tRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this report, including our financial statements and the related notes thereto, before making a decision to invest in our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently believe are not material, also may become important factors that affect us and impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the events or developments discussed in the risk factors below could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and in such case, our future prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. If any of such events or developments were to happen, the trading price of our common stock and the value of our 10.5% Series E Convertible Preferred Stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we cannot obtain additional funding, our product development efforts may be reduced or discontinued and we may not be able to expand our contract manufacturing business.\nAt April 30, 2016, we had $61,412,000 in cash and cash equivalents. We have expended substantial funds on the research and development of our product candidates, and funding the operations of Avid. As a result, we have historically experienced negative cash flows from operations since our inception and we expect negative cash flows from operations to continue for at least the next two fiscal years before we believe we can generate sufficient revenue from Avid\u2019s contract manufacturing services to achieve profitability. Therefore, unless and until we are able to generate sufficient revenue from Avid\u2019s contract manufacturing services or from the sale or licensing of our product candidates under development, we expect such losses to continue for at least the next two fiscal years.\nOur ability to continue to fund our operations is highly dependent on the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand combined with our ability to raise additional capital to support our future operations through one or more methods, including but not limited to, (i) raising additional capital in the equity markets, (ii) generating additional revenue from Avid, or (iii) licensing or partnering our product candidates in development.\nHistorically, we have funded a significant portion of our operations through the issuance of equity. During fiscal year 2016, we raised $45,872,000 in aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock (as described in Note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements). Subsequent to April 30, 2016 and through July 14, 2016, we raised an additional $2,169,000 in aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock (as described in Note 12 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements). As of July 14, 2016, $112,445,000 remained available to us under our two effective shelf registration statements, which allows us from time to time to offer and sell shares of our common stock or preferred stock, in one or more offerings, either individually or in combination.\nOur ability to raise additional capital in the equity markets to fund our obligations in future periods is dependent on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the market demand for our common stock or 10.5% Series E Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries E Preferred Stock\u201d). The market demand or liquidity of our common stock and/or Series E Preferred Stock is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, negative economic conditions, adverse market conditions, adverse financial results, and negative research and development results.\nWith respect to our ability to generate additional revenue from Avid, on March 7, 2016, we announced the formal commissioning of our Myford facility, which has the capacity to generate up to an estimated $40 million in annual revenue. In addition, as of April 30, 2016, Avid had a revenue backlog of $56 million under committed contracts from existing customers covering manufacturing services expected to be completed during fiscal year 2017 and into fiscal year 2018.\nAlthough it is difficult to predict all of our future liquidity requirements, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of April 30, 2016 combined with the additional proceeds raised subsequent to April 30, 2016 and through July 14, 2016, and the projected cash receipts from Avid\u2019s customers will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next twelve months, which estimate assumes we raise no additional capital from the capital markets or other potential sources.\nIf we are unable to either (i) raise sufficient capital in the equity markets, (ii) generate additional revenue from Avid, or (iii) license or partner our products in development, or any combination thereof, we may need to delay, scale back, or eliminate some or all our research and development efforts, restructure our operations, which may include delaying the expansion of our contract manufacturing business. In addition, even if we are able to raise additional capital, it may not be at a price or on terms that are favorable to us.\nWe have had significant losses, anticipate future losses and may never achieve profitability.\nWe have incurred net losses in most fiscal years since we began operations in 1981. The following table represents net losses incurred for each of the past three fiscal years:\nAs of April 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $509,276,000. In addition, we expect negative cash flows from operations to continue for at least the next two fiscal years before we believe we can generate sufficient revenue from Avid\u2019s contract manufacturing services to achieve profitability. Further, if we fail to generate sufficient revenue from Avid\u2019s contract manufacturing services or at all, we may never achieve profitability.\nFailure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur industry is highly regulated. We are required to comply with the regulatory requirements of various local, state, provincial, national and international regulatory bodies having jurisdiction in the countries or localities in which we manufacture products or in which our customers\u2019 products are distributed. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning development, testing, manufacturing processes, equipment and facilities, including compliance with cGMPs, import and export, and product registration and listing, among other things. As a result, most of our facilities are subject to regulation by the FDA, as well as regulatory bodies of other jurisdictions such as the EMEA and/or Health Canada, depending on the countries in which our customers market and sell the products we manufacture on their behalf. As we expand our operations and geographic scope, we may be exposed to more complex and new regulatory and administrative requirements and legal risks, any of which may require expertise in which we have little or no experience. It is possible that compliance with new regulatory requirements could impose significant compliance costs on us. Such costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThese regulatory requirements impact many aspects of our operations, including manufacturing, developing, storage, distribution, import and export and record keeping related to customers\u2019 products. Noncompliance with any applicable regulatory requirements can result in government refusal to approve (i) facilities for testing or manufacturing products or (ii) products for commercialization. The FDA and other regulatory agencies can delay, limit or deny approval for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7 changes to the regulatory approval process, including new data requirements for product candidates in those jurisdictions, including the United States, in which our customers may be seeking approval;\n\u00b7 that a customer\u2019s product candidate may not be deemed to be safe or effective;\n\u00b7 the ability of the regulatory agency to provide timely responses as a result of its resource constraints; and\n\u00b7 that the manufacturing processes or facilities may not meet the applicable requirements.\nIn addition, if new legislation or regulations are enacted or existing legislation or regulations are amended or are interpreted or enforced differently, we may be required to obtain additional approvals or operate according to different manufacturing or operating standards. This may require a change in our development and manufacturing techniques or additional capital investments in our facilities. Any related costs may be significant. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the future, then we may be subject to warning letters and/or civil or criminal penalties and fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, restrictions on the import and export of our products, debarment, exclusion, disgorgement of profits, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution and the loss of contracts and resulting revenue losses. Inspections by regulatory authorities that identify any deficiencies could result in remedial actions, production stoppages or facility closure, which would disrupt the manufacturing process and supply of product to our customers. In addition, such failure to comply could expose us to contractual and product liability claims, including claims by customers for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients (\u201cAPIs\u201d) or recall or other corrective actions, the cost of which could be significant.\nIn addition, products we manufacture must undergo pre-clinical and clinical evaluations relating to product safety and efficacy before they are approved as commercial therapeutic products. The regulatory authorities having jurisdiction in the countries in which we or our customers intend to market their products may delay or put on hold clinical trials or delay approval of a product or determine that the product is not approvable. The FDA or other regulatory agencies can delay approval of a drug if our manufacturing facility, including any newly commissioned facility, is not able to demonstrate compliance with cGMPs, pass other aspects of pre-approval inspections or properly scale up to produce commercial supplies. The FDA and comparable government authorities having jurisdiction in the countries in which we or our customers intend to market their products have the authority to withdraw product approval or suspend manufacture if there are significant problems with raw materials or supplies, quality control and assurance or the product we manufacture is adulterated or misbranded. If our manufacturing facilities and services are not in compliance with FDA and comparable government authorities, we may be unable to obtain or maintain the necessary approvals to continue manufacturing products for our customers, which would materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe failure to receive or maintain regulatory approval for our or our customers\u2019 product candidates could negatively impact our revenue and profitability.\nOur contract manufacturing business materially depends upon the regulatory approval of the products we manufacture. As such, any delay in, or failure to receive, approval for any of our customers\u2019 product candidates or the failure to maintain regulatory approval for our or our customers\u2019 products could negatively impact our revenue and profitability. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve of our facilities for the manufacture of a customer product or if it withdraws such approval in the future, our customers may choose to identify alternative manufacturing facilities and/or relationships, which could significantly impact our ability to expand our CDMO capacity and capabilities and achieve profitability.\nOur manufacturing services are highly complex, and if we are unable to provide quality and timely services to our customers, our business could suffer.\nThe manufacturing services we offer are highly complex, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. A failure of our quality control systems in our facilities could cause problems to arise in connection with facility operations for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, viral contamination, failure to follow specific manufacturing instructions, protocols and standard operating procedures, problems with raw materials or environmental factors. Such problems could affect production of a single manufacturing run or a series of runs, requiring the destruction of products, or could halt manufacturing operations altogether. In addition, our failure to meet required quality standards may result in our failure to timely deliver products to our customers, which in turn could damage our reputation for quality and service. Any such incident could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, reimbursement to customers for lost drug substance, damage to and possibly termination of existing customer relationships, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other manufacturing runs. With respect to our commercial manufacturing, if problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, we may be subject to regulatory actions, including product recalls, product seizures, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil sanctions, including monetary sanctions, and criminal actions. In addition, such issues could subject us to litigation, the cost of which could be significant.\nBecause a significant portion of our contract manufacturing revenue comes from a limited number of customers, any decrease in sales to these customers could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nContract manufacturing revenue has historically been derived from a small customer base. These third-party customers typically do not enter into long-term commitments because their need for product supply depends on a variety of factors, including the products stage of development, their financial resources, and, the market demand with respect to commercial products. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected if revenue from any one of our primary customers is significantly reduced or eliminated.\nOur CDMO operates in a highly competitive market and competition may adversely affect our business.\nWe operate in a market that is highly competitive. Our competition in the CDMO market includes full-service contract manufacturers and large pharmaceutical companies offering third-party manufacturing services to fill their excess capacity. Also, large pharmaceutical companies have been seeking to divest portions of their manufacturing capacity, and any such divested businesses may compete with us in the future. In addition, most of our competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or other resources than we do. Moreover, additional competition may emerge and may, among other things, result in a decrease in the fees paid for our services, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on third parties to supply most of the necessary raw materials and supplies for the products we manufacture on behalf of our customers and our inability to obtain such raw materials or supplies may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur CDMO operations require various raw materials, including proprietary media, resins, buffers, filters, in addition to numerous additional raw materials supplied primarily by third parties. We or our customers specify the raw materials and other items required to manufacture their product and, in some cases, specify the suppliers from whom we must purchase these raw materials. In certain instances, the raw materials and other items can only be supplied by a limited number of suppliers or in limited quantities. If third-party suppliers do not supply raw materials or other items on a timely basis, it may cause a manufacturing run to be delayed or canceled which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nFurthermore, third-party suppliers may fail to provide us with raw materials and other items that meet the qualifications and specifications required by us or our customers. If third-party suppliers are not able to provide us with raw materials that meet our or our customers\u2019 specifications on a timely basis, we may be unable to manufacture their product or it could prevent us from delivering products to our customers within required timeframes. Any such delay in delivering our products may create liability for us to our customers for breach of contract or cause us to experience order cancellations and loss of customers. In the event that we manufacture products with inferior quality components and raw materials, we may become subject to product liability claims caused by defective raw materials or components from a third-party supplier or from a customer, or our customer may be required to recall its products from the market.\nWe have refocused our clinical development strategy in order to drive partnering interest, which may not be successful.\nIn June 2016, we announced our clinical development strategy focused on conducting small, early stage studies of bavituximab in combination with immune stimulating therapies. These trials may be conducted independently, in conjunction with our collaborators, or through ISTs. The goal of these trials will be to generate compelling clinical and translational data demonstrating bavituximab\u2019s immunotherapeutic mechanism of action in a combination treatment setting. We plan to leverage this data to drive partnering interest in our phosphatidylserine (PS)-targeting platform. Our clinical development strategy is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, the risk that:\n\u00b7 the early stage studies do not generate any compelling data;\n\u00b7 the data, while compelling, is viewed by potential partners as being based on an insufficient sample size; and\n\u00b7 the data, while compelling, is in tumor indications for which there is little or no partnering interest.\nEven if we are successful in generating compelling data that generates partnering interest, we may face additional challenges in consummating a licensing transaction, or on terms acceptable to us, considering the additional later stage clinical trials that such partner would need to conduct, and the time, costs and regulatory risks associated therewith, relative to the remaining life of our patents that cover bavituximab compositions and their use in treating cancer, both alone and in combination therapies, which are currently set to expire between 2024 and 2025, before any potential extensions. If we are unable to efficiently and quickly generate the type and quantity of data needed to drive future partnering interest, we may not be successful in our clinical development strategy, nor obtain any monetary value from our PS-targeting platform, including bavituximab.\nWe rely on third-parties to conduct our clinical trials and many of our preclinical studies. If those parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, our drug candidates may not advance in a timely manner or at all.\nIn the course of our discovery, preclinical testing and clinical trials, we rely on third parties, including universities, investigators and CROs, to perform critical services for us. For example, we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and many of our preclinical studies. CROs and investigators are responsible for many aspects of the trials, including finding and enrolling patients for testing and administering the trials. We therefore must rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, but their failure to comply with all regulatory and contractual requirements, or to perform their services in a timely and acceptable manner, may compromise our clinical trials in particular or our business in general. Although we rely on these third parties to conduct our clinical trials, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices (\u201cGCPs\u201d) for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the trial patients are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. These third parties may not be available when we need them or, if they are available, may not comply with all regulatory and contractual requirements or may not otherwise perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner. Any failings by these third parties may compromise our clinical trials in particular or our business in general. Similarly, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties and our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated. These independent third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. For example, if such third parties fail to perform their obligations in compliance with our clinical trial protocols, our clinical trials may not meet regulatory requirements or may need to be repeated. As a result of our dependence on third parties, we may face delays or failures outside of our direct control. These risks also apply to the development activities of our collaborators, and we do not control our collaborators\u2019 research and development, clinical trials or regulatory activities.\nFailure to recruit, enroll and retain patients for clinical trials may cause the development of our product candidates to be delayed or development costs to increase substantially.\nWhile our clinical development strategy is focused on conducting small, early stage studies of bavituximab in combination with immune stimulating therapies, we may none-the-less experience delays in patient enrollment in these clinical trials for a variety of reasons. The timely completion of clinical trials in accordance with their protocols depends on, among other things, our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the study until its conclusion. The enrollment of patients depends on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the patient eligibility criteria defined in the protocol;\n\u00b7 the size of the patient population required for analysis of the trial\u2019s primary endpoints;\n\u00b7 the proximity of patients to study sites;\n\u00b7 the design of the trial;\n\u00b7 our ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain and maintain patient consents;\n\u00b7 the risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the trials before completion; and\n\u00b7 competition for patients by clinical trial programs for other competitive treatments.\nOur planned early stage clinical trials will compete with other clinical trials for product candidates that are in the same therapeutic areas as our product candidates, and this competition reduces the number and types of patients available to us, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors. In addition, some of these competing clinical trials will be for product candidates in later stage clinical trials with compelling data from earlier stage trials that could influence the patient\u2019s decision to opt to enroll in the competitive trial. Since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, we conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use, which reduces the number of patients who are available for our clinical trials in such clinical trial site. Delays in patient enrollment in our planned early stage clinical trials may affect the timing or outcome of our clinical trials, which could prevent us from completing these trials and generating the compelling data necessary to drive partnering interest.\nSuccess in early clinical trials may not be indicative of results obtained in later trials, which could hinder future partner interest.\nOur clinical development strategy is dependent on our ability to generate compelling data from small, early stage studies of bavituximab in combination with immune stimulating therapies. A number of new drugs and biologics have shown promising results in initial clinical trials, but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and effectiveness data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, as we evidenced with our Phase III SUNRISE trial. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are subject to varying interpretations, which may delay, limit or prevent us from generating partnering interest.\nIf we do not establish additional collaborations, or if the trials conducted by our collaborators do not proceeds efficiently, our clinical development strategy may not be successful.\nOur clinical development strategy is focused on conducting small, early stage studies of bavituximab in combination with immune stimulating therapies. We anticipate that a number of these trials will be conducted in conjunction with our collaborators, such as NCCN. In order to be successful, we may need to generate a significant amount of compelling data in a number of cancer indications and therefore, may need to enter into one or more of additional collaborations in the future. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators and these collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. We may not be able to negotiate collaborations on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we successfully enter into a collaboration, our collaborator may not perform its contractual obligations or may terminate the agreement.\nIn addition, many of these early stage studies may be conducted by our existing or future collaborators as ISTs. While the use of ISTs will allow us to increase the number of early stage trials of bavituximab and conserve our financial and personnel resources, because we do not have control over the conduct of these trials, we do not have the ability to influence the speed at which these trials are conducted, including the rate at which patients are enrolled or data is analyzed.\nAny one or a combination of these factors could adversely affect our ability to timely generate the compelling data that is necessary to attract potential partners to advance the bavituximab program.\nIf we use hazardous and biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages.\nOur research and development activities and manufacturing operations involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S. governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and chemicals. Although we believe that our procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards, we may incur significant additional costs to comply with applicable laws in the future. Also, even if we are in compliance with applicable laws, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials or chemicals. As a result of any such contamination or injury, we may incur liability or local, city, state or federal authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our resources. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research and development activities and manufacturing operations, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may have significant product liability exposure because we maintain only limited product liability insurance.\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the administration of one of our product candidates during a clinical trial adversely affects or causes the death of a patient. Although we maintain product liability insurance for clinical studies in the amount of $10,000,000 per occurrence or $10,000,000 in the aggregate on a claims-made basis, as well as country-specific coverage where required for clinical sites located in foreign countries, our coverage may not be adequate. Product liability insurance is expensive, difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, if at all. Our inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage on reasonable terms or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage, if any, or a product recall, could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations.\nIn addition, the contract manufacturing services that we offer through Avid expose us to an inherent risk of liability as the antibodies or other substances manufactured by Avid, at the request and to the specifications of our customers, could possibly cause adverse effects or have product defects. We obtain agreements from our customers indemnifying and defending us from any potential liability arising from such risk. However, these indemnification agreements may not adequately protect us against potential claims relating to such contract manufacturing services or protect us from being named in a possible lawsuit. Although Avid has procured insurance coverage, we may not be able to maintain our existing coverage or obtain additional coverage on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against all potential claims to which we might be exposed. A partially successful or completely uninsured claim against Avid could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur research and development activities rely on technology licensed from third parties, and termination of any of those licenses would result in loss of significant rights to develop and market our products, which would impair our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have been granted rights to a variety of technologies necessary for our research and development activities from third parties through license agreements. Each license generally may be terminated by the licensor if we fail to perform our obligations under the agreement, including obligations to develop the product candidates or technologies under license. If terminated, we would lose the right to develop the product candidates, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The license agreements also generally require us to meet specified milestones or show reasonable diligence in development of the technology. If disputes arise over the definition of these requirements or whether we have satisfied the requirements in a timely manner, or if any other obligations in the license agreements are disputed by the other party, the other party could terminate the agreement, and we could lose our rights to develop the licensed technology.\nIn addition, if new technology is developed from these licenses, we may be required to negotiate certain key financial and other terms, such as milestone and royalty payments, for the licensing of this future technology with the third party licensors, and it might not be possible to obtain any such license on terms that are satisfactory to us, or at all.\nIf we are unable to obtain, protect and enforce our patent rights, we may be unable to effectively protect or exploit our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain, protect and enforce commercially valuable patents. We try to protect our proprietary positions by filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to developing our business. However, if we fail to obtain and maintain patent protection for our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements, our competitors could develop and commercialize products that would otherwise infringe upon our patents.\nOur patent position is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Legal standards relating to the validity and scope of claims in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical fields are still evolving. Accordingly, the degree of future protection for our patent rights is uncertain. The risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to our patents include the following:\n\u00b7 the pending patent applications we have filed or to which we have exclusive rights may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents;\n\u00b7 the claims of any patents that issue may not provide meaningful protection;\n\u00b7 we may be unable to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u00b7 the patents licensed or issued to us may not provide a competitive advantage;\n\u00b7 other parties may challenge patents licensed or issued to us;\n\u00b7 disputes may arise regarding the invention and corresponding inventorship and ownership rights in inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us, our licensors, corporate partners and other scientific collaborators; and\n\u00b7 other parties may design around our patented technologies.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, our business may be adversely impacted.\nThe patent protection for our product candidates may expire before we are able to maximize their commercial value, which may subject us to increased competition and reduce or eliminate our opportunity to generate product revenue.\nThe patents for our product candidates have varying expiration dates and, if these patents expire, we may be subject to increased competition and we may not be able to recover our development costs or market any of our approved products profitably. For example, one of our U.S. patents claims compounds encompassing bavituximab and is due to expire in 2024, and two of our other U.S. patents claim treatment methods encompassing bavituximab and are due to expire in 2025. In some of the larger potential market territories, such as the United States and Europe, patent term extension or restoration may be available to compensate for time taken during aspects of the product\u2019s development and regulatory review. However, such an extension may not be granted, or if granted, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded during any extension period may not be sufficient to maximize the commercial value of the patent(s). In addition, even though some regulatory authorities may provide some other exclusivity for a product under their own laws and regulations, we may not be able to qualify the product or obtain the exclusive time period. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension/restoration or some other exclusivity, we could be subject to increased competition and our opportunity to establish or maintain product revenue could be substantially reduced or eliminated. Furthermore, we may not have sufficient time to recover our development costs prior to the expiration of our U.S. and non-U.S. patents.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents that would be expensive, time consuming and may lead to disclosure of our confidential information.\nIn order to protect or enforce our patent rights, we may initiate patent litigation against third parties. In addition, we may become subject to interference, opposition or other post-grant review proceedings conducted in patent and trademark offices to determine the priority and/or patentability of inventions. The defense of intellectual property rights, including patent rights through lawsuits, interference, opposition or other post-grant review proceedings and other legal and administrative proceedings, would be costly and divert our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put our pending patent applications at risk of not being issued.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. For example, during the course of this kind of litigation, confidential information may be inadvertently disclosed in the form of documents or testimony in connection with discovery requests, depositions or trial testimony. This disclosure could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial results.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenues and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages and surges, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which we have limited insurance or are predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our manufacturing operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Our ability to obtain raw materials, components and supplies for the manufacture, as well as the services of outside testing laboratories, of our third party customers\u2019 products, for which we act as a contract manufacturer, could be disrupted, if the operations of these suppliers and/or labs is affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption. Our corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility is located in California near major earthquake faults. The ultimate impact on us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown, but our operations and financial condition could suffer in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster.\nWe may not be able to compete with our competitors in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries because many of them have greater resources than we do and they are further along in their development efforts.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is intensely competitive and any product candidate developed by us would compete with existing drugs and therapies. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities, government agencies and research organizations that compete with us in developing various approaches to cancer therapy.\nIn addition, we are aware of several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies actively engaged in research and development of immunotherapy-based products that have commenced clinical trials with, or have successfully commercialized, these products. Some or all of these companies may have greater financial resources, larger technical staffs and larger research budgets than we have, as well as greater experience in developing products and running clinical trials. We expect to continue to experience significant and increasing levels of competition in the future. In addition, there may be other companies which are currently developing competitive technologies and products or which may in the future develop technologies and products that are comparable or superior to our technologies and products.\nIf we lose qualified management, including manufacturing or scientific personnel or are unable to attract and retain such personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop or manufacture our products or our customers\u2019 products.\nOur success is dependent, in part, upon a limited number of key executive officers, each of whom is an at-will employee. For example, because of his extensive understanding of our contract manufacturing operations, technologies and product development programs, the loss of Mr. Steven W. King, our President and Chief Executive Officer, would adversely affect our contract manufacturing operations and product development efforts during the six- to twelve-month period that we estimate it would take to find a qualified replacement.\nWe also believe that our future success will depend largely upon our ability to attract and retain highly-skilled manufacturing, process development and research and development personnel. We face intense competition in our recruiting activities, including competition from larger companies with greater resources. We do not know if we will be successful in attracting or retaining skilled personnel. The loss of certain key employees or our inability to attract and retain other qualified employees could negatively affect our operations and financial performance.\nWe have federal and state net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carry forwards which, if we were to become profitable, could be used to offset/defer federal and state income taxes. Our ability to use such carry forwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations related to changes in ownership of our stock.\nAs of April 30, 2016, we had federal and state NOL carry forwards of approximately $385 million and $277 million, respectively, expiring from 2017 to 2036. These NOL carry forwards could potentially be used to offset certain future federal and state income tax liabilities. However, utilization of NOL carry forwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as well as similar state provisions due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period. We performed a detailed analysis of our NOL carry forwards through April 30, 2015 and it was determined that no change in ownership had occurred. However, no Section 382 analysis has been performed subsequent to April 30, 2015, and therefore, our net operating loss carry forwards may be subject to limitation based on events occurring subsequent to the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the carry forwards before utilization. If we were not able to utilize our carry forwards, we would be required to use our cash resources to pay taxes that would otherwise have been offset, thereby reducing our liquidity.\nWe have become increasingly dependent on information technology and any breakdown, interruption or breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure in connection with the conduct of our business. We must constantly update our information technology infrastructure and our various current information technology systems throughout the organization may not continue to meet our current and future business needs. Furthermore, modification, upgrade or replacement of such systems may be costly. In addition, due to the size and complexity of these systems, any breakdown, interruption, corruption or unauthorized access to or cyber-attack on these systems could create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. While we attempt to take appropriate security and cyber-security measures to protect our data and information technology systems and to prevent such breakdowns and unauthorized breaches and cyber-attacks, we cannot guarantee that these measures will be successful and that these breakdowns and breaches in, or attacks on, our systems and data will be prevented. Such breakdowns, breaches or attacks may cause business interruption and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares to decline, and we may suffer financial damage or other loss, including fines or criminal penalties because of lost or misappropriated information.\nOur governance documents and state law provide certain anti-takeover measures which will discourage a third party from seeking to acquire us unless approved by the Board of Directors.\nWe have a shareholder rights plan that is designed to protect stockholders against unsolicited attempts to acquire control of us that do not offer a fair price to our stockholders as determined by our board of directors. Under the plan, the acquisition of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock by any person or group, unless approved by our board of directors, will trigger the right of our stockholders (other than the acquirer of 15% or more of our common stock) to acquire additional shares of our common stock, and, in certain cases, the stock of the potential acquirer, at a 50% discount to market price, thus significantly increasing the acquisition cost to a potential acquirer. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain certain additional anti-takeover protective devices. For example,\n\u00b7 no stockholder action may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote; solicitations by consent are thus prohibited;\n\u00b7 special meetings of stockholders may be called only by our board of directors; and\n\u00b7 our board of directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to fix the rights and preferences, and issue shares, of preferred stock. An issuance of preferred stock with dividend and liquidation rights senior to the common stock and convertible into a large number of shares of common stock could prevent a potential acquirer from gaining effective economic or voting control.\nFurther, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which, subject to certain exceptions, restricts certain transactions and business combinations between a corporation and a stockholder owning 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock for a period of three years from the date the stockholder becomes a 15% stockholder.\nAlthough we believe these provisions and our rights plan collectively provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nOur bylaws, as amended, provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur bylaws, as amended, provide that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, any action to interpret, apply, enforce, or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe sale of substantial shares of our common stock may depress our stock price.\nAs of April 30, 2016, there were 236,930,485 shares of our common stock outstanding. Substantially all of these shares are eligible for trading in the public market, subject in some cases to volume and other limitations. The market price of our common stock may decline if our common stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the market perceives that such sales may occur.\nIn addition, our common stock outstanding as of April 30, 2016 excludes the following common shares reserved for future issuance:\n\u00b7 39,561,165 common shares reserved for issuance under outstanding option grants and available for issuance under our stock incentive plans;\n\u00b7 1,408,659 common shares reserved for and available for issuance under our 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \u201cEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\u201d);\n\u00b7 273,280 common shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants; and\n\u00b7 45,745,760 common shares issuable upon conversion of our outstanding Series E Preferred Stock.\nIn addition, we expect we will continue to need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations and to support the expansion of our manufacturing operations for at least the next two fiscal years before we believe we can generate sufficient revenue from Avid\u2019s contract manufacturing services to achieve profitability. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, the market price of our securities may decline and our existing stockholders may experience significant dilution.\nOur highly volatile stock price may adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock and the market prices of securities of companies in the biotechnology sector have generally been highly volatile and are likely to continue to be highly volatile. For instance, the market price of our common stock has ranged from $0.33 to $3.18 per share over the last three fiscal years ended April 30, 2016.\nIn addition, the market price of our common stock may be significantly impacted by many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 the success or failure of our internal drug development efforts;\n\u00b7 positive or negative data reported on programs in clinical trials we or our investigators are conducting;\n\u00b7 announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 Avid\u2019s loss of a significant customer;\n\u00b7 uncertainties about our ability to continue to fund our operations beyond the next twelve months;\n\u00b7 significant changes in our financial results or that of our competitors, including our ability to continue as a going concern;\n\u00b7 our ability to meet revenue projections;\n\u00b7 the offering and sale of shares of our common stock, either sold at market prices or at a discount under an equity transaction;\n\u00b7 significant changes in our capital structure;\n\u00b7 published reports by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 announcements of partnering transactions, licensing agreements, joint ventures, strategic alliances, and any other transaction that involves the development, sale or use of our technologies or competitive technologies;\n\u00b7 developments and/or disputes concerning our patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 regulatory developments, including possible delays, and product safety concerns;\n\u00b7 outcomes of significant litigation, disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings;\n\u00b7 general stock trends in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry sectors;\n\u00b7 public concerns as to the safety and effectiveness of our products;\n\u00b7 economic trends and other external factors, including but not limited to, interest rate fluctuations, economic recession, inflation, foreign market trends, national crisis, and disasters; and\n\u00b7 healthcare reimbursement reform and cost-containment measures implemented by government agencies.\nThese and other external factors have caused and may continue to cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock, and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock.\nIf we fail to meet continued listing standards of NASDAQ, our common stock may be delisted, which could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market. On April 12, 2016 we received a letter from the staff of the Listing Qualifications Department (the \u201cStaff\u201d) of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) notifying us that, for the previous 30 consecutive business days, the bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market under NASDAQ\u2019s Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), requiring a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share (the \u201cMinimum Bid Price Requirement\u201d). In accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), if during the 180 calendar days following the date of the notification, or prior to October 10, 2016, the closing bid price of our common stock is at or above $1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, but generally no more than 20 consecutive business days, the Staff will provide us with written confirmation of compliance. If we do not achieve compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by October 10, 2016, we may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar days compliance period if we meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The NASDAQ Capital Market, with the exception of the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and provides written notice of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. However, if it appears to the Staff that we will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if we are otherwise not eligible, the Staff would notify us that our securities would be subject to delisting. In the event of such notification, we may appeal the Staff\u2019s determination to delist our securities, but there can be no assurance the Staff would grant our request for continued listing. If our common stock were to be delisted, the liquidity of our common stock would be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decrease.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings, if any, for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research reports about us, or if they issue adverse opinions about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business will influence the market for our common stock. If one or more analysts who cover us issues an adverse opinion about us, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases research coverage of us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Further, if we fail to meet the market expectations of analysts who follow our stock, our stock price likely would decline.\nadditional Risks Related to the Ownership of our Series E Preferred Stock\nWe may not be able to pay dividends on the series e preferred stock.\nWe are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law, or if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. In addition, payment of our dividends depends upon our financial condition and other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our Series E Preferred Stock.\nThe market price of the Series E Preferred Stock could be substantially affected by various factors.\nThe market price of the Series E Preferred Stock will depend on many factors, which may change from time to time, including:\n\u00b7 prevailing interest rates, increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Series E Preferred Stock;\n\u00b7 trading prices of common and preferred equity securities issued by other biopharmaceutical companies;\n\u00b7 the annual yield from distributions on the Series E Preferred Stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments;\n\u00b7 announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 publicity regarding actual or potential company-sponsored clinical trial and investigator-sponsored clinical trial results relating to products under development by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 announcements of licensing agreements, joint ventures, strategic alliances, and any other transaction that involves the development, sale or use of our technologies;\n\u00b7 regulatory developments and product safety concerns;\n\u00b7 general economic and financial market conditions;\n\u00b7 government action or regulation;\n\u00b7 significant changes in the financial condition, performance and prospects of us and our competitors;\n\u00b7 changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us, our competitors in our industry;\n\u00b7 our issuance of additional preferred equity or debt securities; and\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results of us and our competitors.\nAs a result of these and other factors, holders of our Series E Preferred Stock may experience a decrease, which could be substantial and rapid, in the market price of the Series E Preferred Stock, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.", "PERMNO": 12266, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "CDMO"}
