{"cik": "317540", "company": "COCA COLA BOTTLING CO CONSOLIDATED /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nIn addition to other information in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.\nThe inability of the Company to successfully integrate the operations and employees acquired in the Expansion Transactions and in any future Expansion Transactions into existing operations could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, culture or results of operations.\nThe Company is engaged in a multi-year series of transactions through which it is acquiring distribution territories and manufacturing facilities from Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. (\u201cCCR\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Company. Through these acquisitions and additional resources needed to support the Company\u2019s growth, the number of employees has grown to more than 13,100 as of January 1, 2017 from 6,500 as of February 1, 2013.\nThere are many risks faced by the Company as it continues to acquire new workforces in new geographic areas. The Company must comply with local laws, including employment laws, for the new geographic areas in which it is expanding its business. The Company must ensure it has proper staffing with the availability and knowledge to support the volume of acquired employees and transactions. Also, the Company must devote resources to communicate its culture and to integrate new employees from previous employers\u2019 culture to the Company\u2019s culture. The inability to support the volume of employees and the inability to successfully integrate employees to one common culture could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company faces additional risk in its ability to successfully combine the Company\u2019s existing business with the acquired distribution territories and manufacturing facilities. It must integrate production, distribution, sales and administrative support activities and information technology systems between the Legacy Territories and the Expansion Territories. It must also conform standards, controls, including internal controls over financial reporting, environmental compliance and health and safety compliance, procedures and policies between the Legacy Territories and the Expansion Territories.\nThe completed Expansion Transactions and any future expansion transactions involve certain other financial and business risks. The Company may not realize a satisfactory return, including economic benefit and productivity levels, on the Company\u2019s investment. The Company\u2019s assumptions for potential growth, synergies or cost savings at the time of the Expansion Transactions may prove to be incorrect. Also, the Expansion Transactions could divert the attention of key members of the Company\u2019s management and other available resources from its existing business in the Legacy Territories and previously acquired Expansion Territories.\nSustained increases in the costs of labor and employment matters, for current, future and retired employees, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company uses various insurance structures to manage costs related to workers\u2019 compensation, auto liability, medical and other insurable risks. These structures consist of retentions, deductibles, limits and a diverse group of insurers that serve to strategically transfer and mitigate the financial impact of losses. The Company uses commercial insurance as a risk reduction strategy to minimize catastrophic losses from claims. Losses are accrued using assumptions and procedures followed in the insurance industry, then adjusted for company-specific history and expectations. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability is substantially affected by the cost of pension retirement benefits, postretirement medical benefits and current employees\u2019 medical benefits. Macro-economic factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including increases in health care costs,\ndeclines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities could result in significant increases in these costs for the Company. Also, the acquisition of Expansion Territories and employees, including integrating programs in the Expansion Territories, requires additional costs and resources. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company\u2019s operations.\nAs the Company\u2019s workforce grows, it faces additional risk for employment-related claims and assessments. In addition, workplace safety programs must be expanded to cover a larger workforce.\nMiscalculation of the Company\u2019s need for infrastructure investment could impact the Company\u2019s financial results in both the Company\u2019s Legacy and Expansion Territories and any future expansion territories.\nSignificant changes from the Company\u2019s expected returns on cold drink equipment, fleet, technology and supply chain infrastructure investments could adversely affect the Company\u2019s consolidated financial results. Projected requirements of the Company\u2019s infrastructure investments in the Company\u2019s Legacy Territories, Expansion Territories and any future expansion territories may differ from actual levels if the Company\u2019s volume growth is not as the Company anticipates. The Company\u2019s infrastructure investments are generally long-term in nature; therefore, it is possible the investments made today may not generate the returns expected by the Company as a result of future changes in the marketplace.\nTechnology failures or cyberattacks on the Company\u2019s systems could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and negatively impact the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company depends heavily upon the efficient operation of technological resources. A failure in information technology systems or controls could negatively impact operations. In addition, the Company continuously upgrades and updates current technology or installs new technology. The inability to implement upgrades, updates, or installations in a timely manner, to train employees effectively in the use of technology, or to obtain the anticipated benefits of the Company\u2019s technology could adversely impact results of operations or profitability.\nThe Company is a member of CONA Services LLC (\u201cCONA\u201d) and party to a Master Services Agreement with CONA, pursuant to which the Company is an authorized user of the Coke One North America system (the \u201cCONA System\u201d), which is a uniform information technology system developed to promote operational efficiency and uniformity among all North American Coca-Cola bottlers. The Company is in process of transitioning Legacy Territories and Expansion Territories to the CONA System. The Company believes it has taken the necessary steps to mitigate risk associated with a phased cut-over to the CONA System, including a comprehensive review of internal controls, extensive employee training, and additional verifications and testing to ensure data integrity. There is additional risk involved with the CONA System as the Company relies on The Coca-Cola Company to resolve technology issues and is limited in its authority and ability to resolve errors or make changes to the software.\nThe Company increasingly relies on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information. For example, the Company\u2019s production and distribution facilities, inventory management and driver handheld devices all utilize information technology to maximize efficiencies and minimize costs. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communication between personnel, customers and suppliers depends on information technology. Like most companies, the Company\u2019s information technology systems may be vulnerable to interruption due to a variety of events beyond the Company\u2019s control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. The Company may also experience difficulties integrating systems from Expansion Territories with those in its Legacy Territories. The Company has technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate the Company\u2019s risk to these vulnerabilities, however these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to ensure that the Company\u2019s operations are not disrupted.\nChanges in public and consumer preferences related to nonalcoholic beverages, including concerns related to obesity and health concerns, as well as perception of artificial ingredients, could reduce demand for the Company\u2019s products and reduce profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of the Company\u2019s business depends in large measure on working with the Beverage Companies, and the Company is reliant upon The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies\u2019 product innovations to meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market. Failure to satisfy changing consumer preferences could adversely affect the profitability of the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s success also depends in large part on its ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all its products. The Company has rigorous product safety and quality standards. However, if beverage products taken to market are or\nbecome contaminated or adulterated, the Company may be required to conduct costly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which would cause its business to suffer.\nHealth and wellness trends over the past several years have resulted in a shift from sugar sparkling beverages to diet sparkling beverages, tea, sports drinks, enhanced water and bottled water. Consumers, public health officials, public health advocates and government officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the public health consequences associated with obesity, particularly among young people. The production and marketing of beverages are subject to the rules and regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) and other federal, state and local health agencies.\nIn addition, regulatory actions, activities by nongovernmental organizations and public debate and concerns about perceived negative safety and quality consequences of certain ingredients in the Company\u2019s products, such as non-nutritive sweeteners, may erode consumers\u2019 confidence in the safety and quality of the Company\u2019s products, whether or not justified, and could result in additional governmental regulations concerning the production, marketing, labeling or availability of the Company\u2019s products, possible new taxes or negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against the Company or other companies in the same industry, all of which could damage the reputation of the Company\u2019s products and may reduce demand for the Company\u2019s products, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nChanges in the Company\u2019s top customer relationships and marketing strategies could impact volume and revenues.\nThe Company faces concentration risks related to a few customers comprising a large portion of the Company\u2019s annual sales volume and net revenue. The Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected if revenue from one or more of these significant customers is significantly reduced or if the cost of complying with the customers\u2019 demands is significant. Additionally, if receivables from one or more of these significant customers become uncollectible, the Company\u2019s results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nThe Company\u2019s largest customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Food Lion, LLC and The Kroger Company accounted for approximately 34% of the Company\u2019s 2016 bottle/can volume to retail customers and approximately 24% of the Company\u2019s 2016 total net sales. These customers typically make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand and customer service performance and generally do not enter into long-term contracts. The Company faces risks to maintain the volume demanded on a short-term basis from these customers, which can also divert resources away from other customers. The loss of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Food Lion, LLC or The Kroger Company as a customer could have a material adverse effect on the operating and financial results of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s revenue is affected by promotion of the Company\u2019s products by significant customers, such as the customers creating in-store displays or promoting the Company\u2019s products in their weekly circulars. If the Company\u2019s significant customers change the manner in which they market or promote the Company\u2019s products, or if the marketing efforts by significant customers become ineffective, the Company\u2019s volume and revenue could be adversely impacted.\nThe Company may not be able to respond successfully to changes in the marketplace.\nThe Company operates in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverage industry and faces strong competition from other general and specialty beverage companies. The Company\u2019s response to continued and increased customer and competitor consolidations and marketplace competition may result in lower than expected net pricing of the Company\u2019s products. The Company\u2019s ability to gain or maintain the Company\u2019s share of sales or gross margins may be limited by the actions of the Company\u2019s competitors, which may have advantages in setting prices due to lower raw material costs. Competitive pressures in the markets in which the Company operates may cause channel and product mix to shift away from more profitable channels and packages. If the Company is unable to maintain or increase volume in higher-margin products and in packages sold through higher-margin channels such as immediate consumption, pricing and gross margins could be adversely affected. The Company\u2019s efforts to improve pricing may result in lower than expected sales volume.\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition can be impacted by the stability of the general economy.\nUnfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the geographic markets in which the Company does business, may have the temporary effect of reducing the demand for certain of the Company\u2019s products. For example, economic forces may cause consumers to shift away from purchasing higher-margin products and packages sold through immediate consumption and other highly profitable channels. Adverse economic conditions could also increase the likelihood of customer delinquencies and bankruptcies, which would increase the risk of uncollectibility of certain accounts. Each of these factors could adversely affect the Company\u2019s overall financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s capital structure, including its cash positions and debt borrowing capacity with banks or other financial institutions, exposes it to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of the Company\u2019s counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, the Company\u2019s ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to retrieve assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty's liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. The Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted by an event of default by or failure of one or more of its counterparties.\nThe Company\u2019s business and results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs, disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials and other supplies.\nIn recent years, there has been consolidation among suppliers of certain of the Company\u2019s raw materials, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to negotiate the lowest costs and, in light of the Company\u2019s relatively small in-plant raw material inventory levels, has the potential for causing interruptions in the Company\u2019s supply of raw materials.\nThe Company currently obtains all aluminum cans from two domestic suppliers and all plastic bottles from two domestic cooperatives. The inability of these aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Company\u2019s requirements for containers could result in the Company not being able to fulfill customer orders and production demand until alternative sources of supply are located. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate. Failure of the aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Company\u2019s purchase requirements could negatively impact inventory levels, customer confidence and results of operations, including sales levels and profitability.\nRaw material costs, including the costs for plastic bottles, aluminum cans and high fructose corn syrup, have historically been subject to significant price volatility and may continue to be in the future. In addition, there are no limits on the prices The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies can charge for concentrate. If the Company cannot offset higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, effective commodity price hedging, increased sales volume or reductions in other costs, the Company\u2019s profitability could be adversely affected.\nThe reliance on purchased finished goods from external sources could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company does not manufacture and does not plan to manufacture all products it distributes and, therefore, remains reliant on purchased finished goods from external sources. As a result, the Company is subject to incremental risk including, but not limited to, product quality and availability, price variability and production capacity shortfalls for externally purchased finished goods, which could have an impact on the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe decisions made by the National Product Supply Group (the \u201cNPSG\u201d) may be different than decisions that would have been made by the Company individually.\nThe NPSG was created in October 2015, and consists of The Coca-Cola Company, the Company and other RPBs in The Coca-Cola Company\u2019s national product supply system. The Coca-Cola Company and each member RPB has a representative on the governing board (the \u201cNPSG Board\u201d). As of January 2017, the NPSG Board consisted of The Coca-Cola-Company, the Company and five other RPBs, including CCR. Pursuant to the NPSG Governance Agreement, the Company has agreed to abide by decisions made by the NPSG Board, which include decisions regarding strategic investment and divestment, optimal national product supply sourcing and new product or packaging infrastructure planning. Even though the Company has a representative on the NPSG Board, the Company will not exercise sole decision-making authority relating to the decisions of the NPSG Board, and the interests of other members of the NPSG Board may diverge from those of the Company and may require the Company to make investments in its manufacturing assets consistent with the NPSG Governance Agreement.\nDecreases from historic levels of marketing funding provided to the Company from The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies could reduce the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies have historically provided financial support to the Company through marketing funding. In 2016, the Company received $99.4 million in marketing funding. While the Company does not believe there will be significant changes to the amount of marketing funding support by the beverage companies, there can be no assurance the historic levels will continue. Material changes in the marketing funding programs\u2019 performance requirements, decreases in the level of marketing funding provided or the Company\u2019s inability to meet the performance requirements for marketing funding could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nChanges in The Coca-Cola Company\u2019s and other beverage companies\u2019 levels of external advertising, marketing spending and product innovation could reduce the Company\u2019s sales volume.\nThe Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies have their own external advertising campaigns, marketing spending and product innovation programs, which directly impact the Company\u2019s operations. Decreases in marketing, advertising and product innovation spending by the Beverage Companies, or Beverage Company campaigns that are negatively perceived by the public, could adversely impact the volume growth and profitability of the Company. While the Company does not believe there will be significant changes in the level of external advertising and marketing spending by the Beverage Companies, there can be no assurance historic levels will continue. The Company\u2019s volume growth is also dependent on product innovation by the Beverage Companies, especially The Coca-Cola Company.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to meet requirements under its beverage agreements could result in the loss of distribution rights.\nApproximately 90% of the Company\u2019s bottle/can volume to retail customers in 2016 consisted of products of The Coca-Cola Company, which is the sole supplier of these products or the concentrates and syrups required to manufacture these products. The Company enters into CBAs and other beverage agreements with The Coca-Cola Company, which authorize the Company to produce and/or distribute the covered beverages defined in these beverage agreements. The Company must satisfy various requirements under its beverage agreements and failure to satisfy these requirements could result in the loss of distribution rights for the respective products under one or more of these beverage agreements. The occurrence of other events defined in these agreements could also result in the termination of one or more beverage agreements.\nChanges in the Company\u2019s level of debt, borrowing costs and credit ratings could impact access to capital and credit markets, restrict the Company\u2019s operating flexibility and limit the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing to fund future needs.\nAs of January 1, 2017, the Company had $956.0 million of debt and capital lease obligations. The Company\u2019s level of debt requires a substantial portion of future cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest, which reduces funds available for other purposes. The Company\u2019s debt level can negatively impact the Company\u2019s operations by:\n\u2022\nLimiting the Company\u2019s ability and/or increasing the cost to obtain funding for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes, including funding the cash purchase price of future territory expansions;\n\u2022\nIncreasing the Company\u2019s vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions by limiting the Company\u2019s ability to react to changing economic and business conditions; and\n\u2022\nExposing the Company to a risk that a significant decrease in cash flows from operations could make it difficult for the Company to meet its debt service requirements and to comply with financial covenants in its debt agreements.\nThe Company\u2019s Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan Facility and pension and postretirement medical benefits are subject to changes in interest rates. If interest rates increase in the future, the Company\u2019s borrowing cost could increase, which could result in a reduction of the Company\u2019s overall profitability and limit the Company\u2019s ability to spend in other areas. A decline in interest rates used to discount the Company\u2019s pension and postretirement medical liabilities could increase the cost of these benefits and increase the overall liability.\nThe Company\u2019s credit rating could be significantly impacted by changes in the methodologies used by rating agencies to assess the Company\u2019s credit rating and by changes in the credit ratings of The Coca-Cola Company. A lower credit rating could significantly increase the Company\u2019s interest costs or could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing at acceptable interest rates or to refinance existing debt.\nChanges in the inputs used to calculate the Company\u2019s acquisition related contingent consideration liability could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe acquisition related contingent consideration liability, which was $253.4 million as of January 1, 2017, consists of the estimated amounts due to The Coca-Cola Company under the CBAs over the remaining useful life of the related distribution rights. Changes in business conditions or other events could materially change both the projection of future cash flows and the discount rate used in the calculation of the fair value of contingent consideration under the CBAs. These changes could materially impact the fair value of the related contingent consideration and could materially impact the amount of noncash expense (or income) recorded each reporting period.\nChanges in tax laws, disagreements with tax authorities or additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes within the United States. The Company\u2019s annual income tax rate is based upon the Company\u2019s income and the federal tax laws and the various state and local tax laws within the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Increases in federal, state or local income tax rates and changes in federal, state or local tax laws could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial results.\nExcise or other taxes imposed on the sale of certain of the Company\u2019s products by the federal government and certain state and local governments, particularly if the taxes were incorporated into shelf prices and passed along to consumers, could cause consumers to shift away from purchasing products of the Company, which could materially affect the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nIn addition, an assessment of additional taxes resulting from audits of the Company\u2019s tax filings could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nIssues surrounding labor relations could adversely impact the Company\u2019s future profitability and/or its operating efficiency.\nApproximately 9% of the Company\u2019s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The inability to renegotiate subsequent agreements on satisfactory terms and conditions could result in work interruptions or stoppages, which could have a material impact on the profitability of the Company. Also, the terms and conditions of existing or renegotiated agreements could increase costs or otherwise affect the Company\u2019s ability to fully implement operational changes to improve overall efficiency.\nIn addition, as the Company has acquired the Expansion Territories, it has become engaged with new and different labor unions than those with which it has historically interacted. Terms and conditions of the new labor union agreements could result in delays of closings for new Expansion Territories and also increases the Company\u2019s exposure to work interruptions or stoppages, as an increased percentage of its workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements.\nNatural disasters, changing weather patterns and unfavorable weather could negatively impact the Company\u2019s future profitability.\nNatural disasters or unfavorable weather conditions in the geographic regions in which the Company operates could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s revenue and profitability. For instance, unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for the Company\u2019s products and contribute to lower sales, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability for such periods. Prolonged drought conditions could lead to restrictions on water use, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s cost and ability to manufacture and distribute products.\nChanging weather patterns, along with the increased frequency or duration of extreme weather and climate events could impact some of the Company\u2019s facilities or the availability and cost of key raw materials used by the Company in production. In addition, legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency could directly or indirectly affect the Company\u2019s production, distribution and packaging, the cost of raw materials, fuel, ingredients and water, which would impact the Company\u2019s profitability.\nIncreases in fuel prices or the inability of the Company to secure adequate supplies of fuel could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company uses significant amounts of fuel for its delivery fleet and other vehicles used in the distribution of its products. International or domestic geopolitical or other events could impact the supply and cost of fuel and could impact the timely delivery of the Company\u2019s products to its customers. Although the Company strives to reduce fuel consumption and uses commodity hedges to manage the Company\u2019s fuel costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting the impact of fuel price volatility on the Company\u2019s business or future cost increases, which could reduce the profitability of the Company\u2019s operations.\nSignificant additional labeling or warning requirements may inhibit sales of affected products.\nThe FDA occasionally proposes major changes to the nutrition labels required on all packaged foods and beverages, including those for most of the Company\u2019s products. If the proposed changes are adopted, the Company and its competitors will be required to overhaul nutrition labels, including updating serving sizes, information about total calories in a beverage product container and information about any added sugars or nutrients. Pervasive nutrition label changes could increase the Company\u2019s costs and could inhibit sales of one or more of the Company\u2019s major products.\nProvisions in the Final CBA and the Final RMA with The Coca-Cola Company could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company.\nProvisions in the Final CBA and the Final RMA require the Company to obtain The Coca-Cola Company\u2019s prior approval of a potential buyer of the Company\u2019s Coca-Cola distribution or manufacturing related businesses, which could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or the ability of the Company to sell such businesses. The Company can obtain a list of approved third-party buyers from The Coca-Cola Company annually. In addition, the Company can seek buyer-specific approval from The Coca-Cola Company upon receipt of a third party offer to purchase the Company or its Coca-Cola related business.\nThe concentration of the Company\u2019s capital stock ownership with the Harrison family limits other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters.\nMembers of the Harrison family, including the Company\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, J. Frank Harrison, III, beneficially own shares of Common Stock and Class B Common Stock representing approximately 86% of the total voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding capital stock. In addition, three members of the Harrison family, including Mr. Harrison, serve on the Board of Directors of the Company.\nAs a result, members of the Harrison family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over the Company\u2019s management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by the Company\u2019s stockholders. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control otherwise favored by the Company\u2019s other stockholders and could depress the stock price and limits other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters, which could result in the Company making decisions that stockholders outside the Harrison family may not view as beneficial.", "PERMNO": 11995, "SIC": 2086, "TIC": "COKE"}
