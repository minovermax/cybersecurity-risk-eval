RISK FACTORS\nThe following section includes some of the material factors that may adversely affect our business and operations. This is not an exhaustive list, and additional factors could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. This discussion of risk factors includes many forward-looking statements. For cautions about relying on such forward looking statements, please refer to the section entitled \u201cForward Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this Report immediately prior to Item 1.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses and may never become profitable.\nIn each of our last five years, we have experienced significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations. In 2016, we incurred a net loss of $11.1 million and had negative cash flows from operations of $8.1 million. In 2015, we incurred a net loss of $8.6 million and had negative cash flows from operations of $8.5 million. Our independent registered public accounting firm has included in its audit reports an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we fail to increase our revenues, we may not achieve and may not maintain profitability, we may not realize our investment in infrastructure, and may not meet our expectations or the expectations of financial analysts who report on our stock.\nWe may need to raise additional capital. If we are unable to raise capital our ability to implement our current business plan and ultimately our viability as a company could be adversely affected\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $10.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. Our current forecast is that our existing cash resources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations into the first quarter of 2018. Our cash resources may not be sufficient to fund our business through March 30, 2018. Therefore, unless we can materially grow our revenues from commercial operations during such period, we will need to raise additional capital during the next 12-months to continue to implement our current business plan and maintain the viability of the Company.\nWe believe the key factors to our future liquidity will be our ability to successfully use our expertise and our technology to generate revenues in various ways, including commercial operations, joint ventures and licenses. Because of the expected timing and uncertainty of these factors, we will need to raise funds to meet our working capital needs.\nAdditional financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we issue additional equity securities to raise funds, the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders would be reduced. New investors may demand rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock and could also require that we issue warrants in connection with sales of our stock. If we cannot raise any needed funds to grow our commercial resources, we might be forced to make changes to, or delay aspects of, our business plan which could adversely affect our ability to implement our current business plan and ultimately our viability as a company.\nOur strategic initiative to develop a new wire platform may not prove to be successful.\nWe have spent a considerable amount of resources in developing a new wire platform for power applications. Substantial technical and business challenges remain before we can have a commercially successful product introduction. We may not be able to overcome these challenges in a timely or cost effective manner, if at all. Such a failure could adversely impact our prospects, liquidity, stock price and carrying value of our fixed assets.\nThere are numerous technological challenges that must be overcome in order for our Conductus wire to become commercially successful and our ability to address such technological challenges may adversely affect our ability to gain customers.\nOur plan is for commercial production of Conductus wire currently anticipated for the second half of 2017 following completion of qualification orders. Conductus\u00ae wire is uniquely positioned to address three key technical challenges in the market: high performance, improved economics and commercial-scale capacity. To date, we, along with existing HTS wire manufacturers, have not overcome these challenges to allow for broad commercialization of HTS wire. Customers cannot purchase long-length wire with any reasonable confidence or\nguaranteed volume; and electric utilities lack confidence in product availability which leads to delays in their deployment roadmap. HTS wire performance is currently below what many customers require. Many power applications require high performance wire with high current carrying capacity, mechanical durability, electrical integrity with low AC losses and minimal splices. Producing high performance HTS wire has proven difficult, especially at volumes required for large scale deployment. The high demand for high performance wire available in very low volume results in a high wire price that narrows the market and limits commercial viability. We are currently focused on improving our mechanical stress specifications to meet customer requirements for our target applications. We have made significant progress in this area, and our focus is now on using this new template stack to manufacture wire that delivers our customary power handling performance. Such delays and other delays in our Conductus wire development, as a result of technological challenges or other factors, may result in the introduction or commercial acceptance of our Conductus wire products later than expected.\nThe commercial uses of superconducting wire and superconducting wire related products are limited today, and a broad commercial market may not develop.\nEven if the technological hurdles are overcome, there is no certainty that a robust commercial market for unproven HTS wire products will come to fruition. To date, commercial use of HTS wire has been limited to small feasibility demonstrations, and these projects are largely subsidized by government authorities. While customer demand is high and market forecasts project large revenue opportunity for superconducting wire in power applications, the market may not develop and superconducting wire might never achieve long term, broad commercialization. In such an event, we would not be able to commercialize our Conductus wire initiative and our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe have limited experience marketing and selling superconducting wire products, and our failure to effectively market and sell our superconducting wire solutions would lower our revenue and cash flow.\nWe have limited experience marketing and selling our Conductus wire. Once our Conductus wire is ready for commercial use, we will have to hire and develop a marketing and sales team to effectively demonstrate the advantages of our product over both more traditional products and competing superconducting products or other adjacent technologies. We may not be successful in our efforts to market this new technology.\nWe expect continued customer pressures to reduce our product pricing which may adversely affect our ability to operate on a commercially viable basis.\nWe expect to face pressure to reduce prices and accordingly, the average selling price of our Conductus wire. We anticipate customer pressure on our product pricing will continue for the foreseeable future. HTS wire is currently being sold at $250/kiloampere-meter (kA-m). At this price, HTS wire represents more than half the cost of the end device. A price reduction is required for long term commercialization. Cryogenic systems, including cryocoolers and cryostats, have been developed but will also need to be cost optimized as HTS wire becomes available in volume. We have plans to further reduce the manufacturing cost of our products, but there is no assurance that our future cost reduction efforts will keep pace with price erosion. We will need to further reduce our manufacturing costs through engineering improvements and economies of scale in production and purchasing in order to achieve adequate gross margins. We may not be able to achieve the required product cost savings at a rate needed to keep pace with competitive pricing pressure. Additionally, we may be forced to discount future orders or may never reach commercial viability. If we fail to reach our cost saving objectives or we are required to offer future discounts, our business may be harmed.\nWe face competition with respect to various aspects of our technology and product development.\nOur current wireless products compete on the basis of performance, functionality, reliability, pricing, quality, and compliance with industry standards. With respect to our Conductus wire materials, our competition includes American Superconductor (AMSC), SuperPower (Furukawa), SuNam , Bruker, Shanghai Superconductor, BASF,\nSuperOx, Fujikura, Sumitomo and THEVA. In addition, we currently supply components and license technology to several companies that may eventually decide to manufacture or design their own HTS components, rather than purchasing or licensing our technology. If we are unable to compete successfully against our current or future competitors, then our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively against alternative technologies.\nOur products also compete with a number of alternative approaches and technologies. Some of these alternatives may be more cost effective or offer better performance than our products and we may not succeed in competing against these alternatives.\nWe currently rely on specific technologies and may not successfully adapt to the rapidly changing market environments.\nWe must overcome technical challenges to commercialize our Conductus wire. If we are able to do so, we will need to attain customer acceptance of our Conductus wire, and we cannot ensure that such acceptance will occur. We will have to continue to develop and integrate advances to our core technologies. We will also need to continue to develop and integrate advances in complementary technologies. We cannot guarantee that our development efforts will not be rendered obsolete by research efforts and technological advances made by others. Our business success depends upon our ability to keep pace with advancing technology, including materials, processes and industry standards.\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in sales and operating results from quarter to quarter.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe lack of any contractual obligation by our customers to purchase their forecasted demand for our products;\n\u2022\nvariations in the timing, cancellation, or rescheduling of customer orders and shipments; and\n\u2022\nhigh fixed expenses that may disproportionately impact operating expenses, especially during a quarter with a sales shortfall.\nOrder deferrals and cancellations by our customers, declining average sales prices, changes in the mix of products sold, increases in inventory and finished goods, delays in the introduction of new products and longer than anticipated sales cycles for our products have, in the past, adversely affected our results of operations. If our customers desire to purchase products in excess of the forecasted amounts or in a different product mix, there may not be enough inventory or manufacturing capacity to fill their orders.\nDue to these and other factors, our past results have limited predictive value as to our Conductus wire initiative. Future revenues and operating results may not meet the expectations of stock analysts and investors. In either case, the price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected.\nWorldwide economic uncertainty may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe United States and global economies continue to experience a period of economic and financial uncertainty, which could result in economic volatility having direct and indirect adverse effects on our business, operating results and financial condition in a number of ways. For example, current or potential customers may delay or decrease spending with us, may delay paying us for previously purchased products, or may not pay us at all. In addition, this recent downturn has had, and may continue to have, an unprecedented negative impact on the global credit markets. If we are required to obtain financing in the near term to meet our working capital or other business needs, we may not be able to obtain that financing. Further, even if we are able to obtain the financing we need, it may be on terms that are not favorable to us, with increased financing costs and restrictive covenants.\nOur reliance on a limited number of suppliers and the long lead time of components for our products could impair our ability to manufacture and deliver our systems on a timely basis.\nA number of components used in our products are available from a limited number of outside suppliers due to unique designs as well as certain quality and performance requirements. Our reliance on sole or limited source suppliers involves certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. These include the possibility of a shortage or the discontinuation of certain key components. Any reduced availability of these parts or components when required could impair our ability to manufacture and deliver our systems on a timely basis and result in the delay or cancellation of orders, which could harm our business.\nIn addition, the purchase of some of our key components involves long lead times and, in the event of unanticipated increases in demand for our solutions, we may be unable to obtain these components in sufficient quantities to meet our customers\u2019 requirements. We do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with any of these suppliers, do not maintain an extensive inventory of parts or components and customarily purchase sole or limited source parts and components pursuant to purchase orders. Business disruptions, quality issues, production shortfalls or financial difficulties of a sole or limited source supplier could materially and adversely affect us by increasing product costs, or eliminating or delaying the availability of such parts or components. In such events, our inability to develop alternative sources of supply quickly and on a cost-effective basis could impair our ability to manufacture and deliver our systems on a timely basis and could harm our business.\nOur reliance on a limited number of suppliers exposes us to quality control issues.\nOur reliance on certain single-source and limited-source components exposes us to quality control issues if these suppliers experience a failure in their production process or otherwise fail to meet our quality requirements. A failure in single-source or limited-source components or products could force us to repair or replace a product utilizing replacement components. If we cannot obtain comparable replacements or effectively return or redesign our products, we could lose customer orders or incur additional costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our gross margins and results of operations.\nOur ability to protect our patents and other proprietary rights is uncertain, exposing us to possible losses of competitive advantage.\nOur efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not succeed in preventing infringement by others or ensure that these rights will provide us with a competitive advantage. Pending patent applications may not result in issued patents and the validity of issued patents may be subject to challenge. Third parties may also be able to design around the patented aspects of the products. Additionally, certain of the issued patents and patent applications are owned jointly with third parties. Because any owner or co-owner of a patent can license its rights under jointly-owned patents or applications, inventions made by us jointly with others are not subject to our exclusive control. Any of these possible events could result in losses of competitive advantage.\nWe depend on specific patents and licenses to technologies, and we will likely need additional technologies in the future that we may not be able to obtain.\nWe utilize technologies under licenses of patents from others for our products. These patents may be subject to challenge, which may result in significant litigation expense (which may or may not be recoverable against future royalty obligations). Additionally, we continually try to develop new products, and, in the course of doing so, we may be required to utilize intellectual property rights owned by others and may seek licenses to do so. Such licenses may not be obtainable on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. It is also possible that we may inadvertently utilize intellectual property rights held by others, which could result in substantial claims.\nIntellectual property infringement claims against us could materially harm results of operations.\nOur products incorporate a number of technologies, including high-temperature superconductor technology, technology related to other materials, and electronics technologies. Our patent positions, and that of other\ncompanies using high-temperature superconductor technology, is uncertain and there is significant risk that others, including our competitors or potential competitors, have obtained or will obtain patents relating to our products or technologies or products or technologies planned to be introduced by us.\nWe believe that patents may be or have been issued, or applications may be pending, claiming various compositions of matter used in our products. We may need to secure one or more licenses of these patents. There can be no assurances that such licenses could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may be required to expend significant resources to develop alternatives that would not infringe such patents or to obtain licenses to the related technology. We may not be able to successfully design around these patents or obtain licenses to them and may have to defend ourselves at substantial cost against allegations of infringement of third party patents or other rights to intellectual property. In those circumstances, we could face significant liabilities and also be forced to cease the use of key technology.\nOther parties may have the right to utilize technology important to our business.\nWe utilize certain intellectual property rights under non-exclusive licenses or have granted to others the right to utilize certain intellectual property rights licensed from a third party. Because we may not have the exclusive rights to utilize such intellectual property, other parties may be able to compete with us, which may harm our business.\nBecause competition for target employees is intense, we may be subject to claims of unfair hiring practices, trade secret misappropriation or other related claims.\nCompanies in HTS wire industries whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices, trade secret misappropriation or other related claims. We may be subject to such claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel, and such claims may result in material litigation. If this should occur, we could incur substantial costs in defending against these claims, regardless of their merits.\nOur success depends on the attraction and retention of senior management and technical personnel with relevant expertise.\nAs a competitor in a highly technical market, we depend heavily upon the efforts of our existing senior management and technical teams. The loss of the services of one or more members of these teams could slow product development and commercialization objectives. Due to the specialized nature of our products, we also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified technical personnel with substantial industry knowledge and expertise. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and we may not be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business.\nRegulatory changes could substantially harm our business.\nCertain regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries set standards for operations within their territories. HTS wire is subject to a regulatory regime, which may become more strictly regulated if the market grows. Any failure or delay in obtaining necessary approvals could harm our business.\nWe may acquire or make investments in companies or technologies that could cause loss of value to stockholders and disruption of business.\nWe may explore opportunities to acquire companies or technologies in the future. Other than the acquisition of Conductus, Inc. in 2002, we have not made any such acquisitions or investments to date and, therefore, our ability as an organization to make acquisitions or investments is unproven. An acquisition entails many risks, any of which could adversely affect our business, including:\n\u2022\nfailure to integrate operations, services and personnel;\n\u2022\nthe price paid may exceed the value eventually realized;\n\u2022\nloss of share value to existing stockholders as a result of issuing equity securities to finance an acquisition;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees from either our then current business or any acquired business;\n\u2022\nentering into markets in which we have little or no prior experience;\n\u2022\ndiversion of financial resources and management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nassumption of unanticipated liabilities related to the acquired assets; and\n\u2022\nthe business or technologies acquired or invested in may have limited operating histories and may be subjected to many of the same risks to which we are exposed.\nIn addition, future acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or charges related to goodwill or other intangible assets, any of which could harm our business. As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments, our business and prospects may be seriously harmed.\nIf we are unable to implement appropriate controls and procedures to manage our potential growth, we may not be able to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan.\nOur ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process. Growth in future operations would place a significant strain on management systems and resources. We expect that we would need to improve our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures, and would need to expand, train and manage our work force worldwide. Furthermore, we expect that we would be required to manage multiple relationships with various customers and other third parties.\nCompliance with environmental regulations could be especially costly due to the hazardous materials used in the manufacturing process. In addition, we could incur expenditures related to hazardous material accidents.\nWe are subject to a number of federal, state and local governmental regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our business. Current or future laws and regulations could require substantial expenditures for preventative or remedial action, reduction of chemical exposure, waste treatment or disposal. Any failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines, suspension of production or interruption of operations. In addition, these regulations could restrict our ability to expand or could require us to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant expense to comply with environmental regulations or to clean up prior discharges.\nIn addition, although we believe that our safety procedures for the handling and disposing of hazardous materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, there is always the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. To date, we have not incurred substantial expenditures for preventive action with respect to hazardous materials or for remedial action with respect to any hazardous materials accident, but the use and disposal of hazardous materials involves risk that we could incur substantial expenditures for such preventive or remedial actions. If such an accident were to occur, we could be held liable for resulting damages. The liability in the event of an accident or the costs of such remedial actions could exceed our resources or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe reliability of market data included in our public filings is uncertain.\nSince we operate in a rapidly changing market, we have in the past, and may from time to time in the future, include market data from industry publications and our own internal estimates in some of the documents we file\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission. The reliability of this data cannot be assured. Industry publications generally state that the information contained in these publications has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but that its accuracy and completeness is not guaranteed. Although we believe that the market data used in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission is and will be reliable, it has not been independently verified. Similarly, internal company estimates, while believed by us to be reliable, have not been verified by any independent sources.\nOur international operations expose us to certain risks.\nIn 2007, we formed a joint venture with BAOLI to manufacture and sell our SuperLink interference elimination solution in China. In addition to facing many of the risks faced by our domestic business, if that joint venture or any other international operation we may have is to be successful, we (together with any joint venture partner) must recruit the necessary personnel and develop the facilities needed to manufacture and sell the products involved, learn about the local market (which may be significantly different from our domestic market), build brand awareness among potential customers and compete successfully with local organizations with greater market knowledge and potentially greater resources than we have. We must also obtain a number of critical governmental approvals from both the United States and the local country governments on a timely basis, including those related to any transfers of our technology. We must establish sufficient controls on any foreign operations to ensure that those operations are operated in accordance with our interests, that our intellectual property is protected and that our involvement does not inadvertently create potential competitors. There can be no assurance that these conditions will be met. Even if they are met, the process of building our international operations could divert financial resources and management attention from other business concerns. Finally, our international operations will also be subject to the general risks of international operations, such as:\n\u2022\nchanges in exchange rates;\n\u2022\ninternational political and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulation in various countries;\n\u2022\ntrade barriers;\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences; and\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is expected to be, subject to significant volatility. The value of our common stock may decline regardless of our operating performance or prospects. Factors affecting our market price include:\n\u2022\nour perceived prospects and liquidity;\n\u2022\nprogress or any lack of progress (or perceptions related to progress) in timely overcoming the remaining substantial technical and commercial challenges related to our Conductus wire initiative;\n\u2022\nvariations in our operating results and whether we have achieved key business targets;\n\u2022\nchanges in, or our failure to meet, earnings estimates;\n\u2022\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 buy/sell recommendations;\n\u2022\ndifferences between our reported results and those expected by investors and securities analysts;\n\u2022\nannouncements of new contracts by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nmarket reaction to any acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments announced by us or our competitors; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, political or stock market conditions.\nRecent events have caused stock prices for many companies, including ours, to fluctuate in ways unrelated or disproportionate to their operating performance. The general economic, political and stock market conditions that may affect the market price of our common stock are beyond our control. The market price of our common stock at any particular time may not remain the market price in the future.\nIf we fail to maintain the listing of our common stock with a U.S. national securities exchange, the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to publicly or privately sell equity securities and the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected if we are delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market or if we are unable to transfer our listing to another stock market.\nOur common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market. NASDAQ has adopted a number of continued listing standards that are applicable to our common stock, including a requirement that the bid price of our common stock be at least $1.00 per share. Failure to maintain the minimum bid price can result in the delisting of our common stock from the NASDAQ Capital Market. We have previously fallen out of compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. On July 18, 2016 we effected a one-for-fifteen reverse stock split in connection with regaining compliance with the minimum bid requirement following a notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market on October 30, 2015 and received a notice of re-compliance from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market on August 2, 2016. We currently have approximately 10,581,594 million publicly held shares as of March 15, 2017. Because of NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing standard which requires that we maintain at least 500,000 publicly held shares, our ability to effectuate a reverse split in the future is limited to a reverse split ratio that would maintain compliance with such publicly held share requirement. This effective limit to a reverse split ratio could prevent us from remediating a minimum bid price violation under circumstances where our stock price was substantially below $1.00 and a higher ratio was needed to remediate the noncompliance.\nIf our common stock is delisted by NASDAQ, our common stock may be eligible to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board, OTC QB or another over-the-counter market. Any such alternative would likely result in it being more difficult for us to raise additional capital through the public or private sale of equity securities and for investors to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of, our common stock. In addition, there can be no assurance that our common stock would be eligible for trading on any such alternative exchange or markets.\nWe have a significant number of outstanding warrants and options, and future sales of the shares obtained upon exercise of these options or warrants could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding options exercisable for an aggregate of 131,158 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $36.03 per share and warrants to purchase up to 9,455,457 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $3.81 per share. Of such warrants, an aggregate of 407,825 warrants originally issued in our August 2013 financing include a price adjustment mechanism whereby the exercise price of such warrants will be automatically reduced, subject to limitations, to the extent we issue shares of our common stock, or equivalents, at a price lower than the then applicable exercise price of such warrants which is currently $1.50.We have registered the issuance of all the shares issuable upon exercise of the options and warrants, and they will be freely tradable by the exercising party upon issuance. The holders may sell these shares in the public markets from time to time, without limitations on the timing, amount or method of sale. As our stock price rises, the holders may exercise their warrants and options and sell a large number of shares. This could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur corporate governance structure may prevent our acquisition by another company at a premium over the public trading price of our shares.\nIt is possible that the acquisition of a majority of our outstanding voting stock by another company could result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the public trading price for our shares. Provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, each as amended, and of Delaware corporate law could delay or make more difficult an acquisition of our company by merger, tender offer or proxy contest, even if it would create an immediate benefit to our stockholders. For example, our restated certificate of incorporation does not permit stockholders to act by written consent, and our bylaws generally require ninety days advance notice of any matters to be brought before the stockholders at an annual or special meeting.\nIn addition, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms, rights and preferences of this preferred stock, including voting rights of those shares, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. At March 15, 2017, 1,374,845 shares of preferred stock remained unissued. The rights of the holders of common stock may be subordinate to, and adversely affected by, the rights of holders of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock could also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock, even at a premium over our public trading price.\nFurthermore, our certificate of incorporation also provides for a classified board of directors with directors divided into three classes serving staggered terms. These provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us without action by our stockholders and, therefore, could adversely affect the price of our stock or the possibility of sale of shares to an acquiring person.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the near future. Our current policy is to retain all funds and earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business.", "PERMNO": 79006, "SIC": 3670, "TIC": "SCON"}
