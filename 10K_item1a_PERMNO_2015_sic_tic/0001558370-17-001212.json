{"cik": "812701", "company": "CALGON CARBON Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors:\nRisks relating to our business\nIncreases in U.S. and European imports of Chinese or other foreign manufactured activated carbon could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe face pressure and competition in our U.S. and European markets from brokers of low cost imported activated carbon products, primarily from China. We believe we offer the market technically superior products and related customer support. However, in some applications, low cost imports have become accepted as viable alternatives to our products because they have been frequently sold at less than fair value in the market. If the markets in which we compete experience an increase in these imported low cost carbons, especially if sold at less than fair value, we could see declines in net sales. In addition, the sales of these low cost activated carbons may make it more difficult for us to pass through raw material price increases to our customers.\nIn response to a petition from the U.S. activated carbon industry filed in March 2006, the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce Department) announced the imposition of anti-dumping duties starting in October 2006. The Commerce Department announcement was based on extensive economic analysis of the operations and pricing practices of the Chinese producers and exporters. The Commerce Department announcement required U.S. Customs and Border Protection to require importers of steam activated carbon from China to post a provisional bond or cash deposit in the amount of the duties. The anti-dumping duties are intended to offset the amount by which the steam activated carbon from China is sold at less than fair value in the U.S.\nAnnual reviews of duties begin to occur in April of the year following the twelve month period then completed. The significant anti-dumping duties originally imposed by the Commerce Department, and the affirmative decision by the International Trade Commission (ITC), has had an adverse impact on the cost of Chinese manufactured activated carbon imported into the U.S. However, the anti-dumping duties could be further reduced or eliminated in the future which could adversely affect demand or pricing of our product.\nWe have operations in multiple foreign countries and, as a result, are subject to foreign exchange translation risk, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe conduct significant business operations in several foreign countries. Of our 2016 net sales, approximately 47% were sales to customers outside of the U.S., and 2016 net sales denominated in non-U.S. dollars represented approximately 32% of our overall net sales. With the acquisition of the New Business, these percentages are expected to increase. We conduct business in the local currencies of each of our foreign subsidiaries or affiliates. Those local currencies are then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. The exchange rates between some of these currencies and the U.S. dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future. Changes in exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, could significantly reduce our sales and profitability from foreign subsidiaries or affiliates from one period to the next as local currency amounts are translated into fewer U.S. dollars.\nOur European and Japanese activated carbon businesses are sourced from both the U.S. and China, which subjects these businesses to foreign exchange transaction risk.\nOur virgin activated carbon is produced primarily in the U.S. We also source significant quantities of activated carbon in China. Produced and sourced activated carbons are provisioned to all of our global operations. Purchases of these carbons are typically denominated in U.S. dollars yet are ultimately sold in other currencies thereby creating foreign currency exchange transaction risk. We generally execute foreign currency derivative contracts of not more than eighteen months in duration to cover a portion of our known or projected foreign currency exposure. However, those contracts do not protect us from longer-term trends of a strengthening U.S. dollar, which could significantly increase our cost of activated carbon delivered to our European and Japanese markets, and we may not be able to offset these costs by increasing our prices.\nOur financial results could be adversely affected by an interruption of supply or an increase in the price of raw materials we use, such as coal and wood.\nWe use bituminous coal as the main raw material in our activated carbon production process. Based upon our current projected usage and price, we estimate that our 2017 coal costs in the U.S. will be approximately $26.6 million excluding the cost of transportation to our carbon manufacturing facilities. We have various annual and multi-year contracts in place for the supply of our coal that expire at various intervals in 2017 and 2018 and cover approximately 88% of our expected 2017 tonnage. Interruptions in coal supply caused by mine accidents, labor disputes, transportation delays, breach of supplier contractual obligations, floods or other events for other than a temporary period could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand. We use very specific high quality metallurgical coals for many of our products. Our inability to obtain these high-quality coals at competitive prices in a timely manner due to changing market conditions with limited high-quality suppliers could also have an adverse affect on our financial results. In addition, increases in the prices we pay for coal under our supply contracts could adversely affect our financial results by significantly increasing production costs. Based upon the current estimated usage and price of coal in 2017, a hypothetical 10% increase in the price of coal, excluding transportation costs, that is not covered by our supply contracts, would result in $0.5 million of additional pre-tax expense to us. We may not be able to pass through raw material price increases to our customers.\nAdditionally, as a result of our acquisition of the New Business in late 2016, wood has become an important raw material for us. We have various contracts in place to secure nearly half of our wood requirement through 2017. Since we require a certain quality of wood, our inability to secure this product could affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products. Our inability to obtain this quality at a reasonable price in a timely manner could affect our operations or financial position. We may not be able to pass through these raw material price increases to our customers.\nA planned or unplanned shutdown at one of our production facilities could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe operate multiple facilities and source product from strategic partners who operate facilities which are close to water or in areas susceptible to floods, hurricanes, and earthquakes. An unplanned shutdown at any of our or our strategic partners\u2019 facilities for more than a temporary period as a result of a hurricane, typhoon, earthquake, flood or other natural disaster, or as a result of fire, explosions, war, terrorist activities, political conflict or other hostilities, or as a result of unforeseen mechanical problems, could significantly affect our ability to meet our demand requirements, thereby resulting in lost sales and profitability in the short-term or eventual loss of customers in the long term. In addition, a prolonged planned shutdown of any of our production facilities due to a change in the business conditions could result in impairment charges that could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nDelays in enactment of new state or federal regulations could restrict our ability to reach our strategic growth targets and lower our return on invested capital.\nOur strategic growth initiatives are reliant upon more restrictive environmental regulations being enacted for the purpose of making water and air cleaner and safer. Examples include regulation of mercury emissions, drinking water disinfection by-products, and ship ballast water. If stricter regulations are delayed or are not enacted or enacted but subsequently repealed or amended to be less strict, or enacted with prolonged phase-in periods, our sales growth targets could be adversely affected and our return on invested capital could be reduced.\nFor example, our Hyde GUARDIAN\u00ae ballast water treatment system received type approval from the IMO in April 2009. However, the IMO Ballast Water Management Convention, which mandates the use of IMO approved ballast water treatment systems for ships in international traffic, was not ratified until September 2016 and is not scheduled to go into force until September 2017. Similarly, the USCG regulates ballast water in U.S. waters, and will not follow the IMO convention. We, along with several other ballast water treatment system manufacturers have received Alternate Management System designation from the USCG, but this is a temporary designation while full USCG type approval is pursued. In December 2015, the USCG decided it would not allow us, and several other manufacturers of ultraviolet light-based ballast water treatment systems, to use the Most Probable Number (MPN) test method for purposes of testing the Company\u2019s system to apply for type approval under USCG regulations. Consequently, we have redesigned our Hyde GUARDIAN\u00ae system under USCG testing protocols and are embarking on testing to support our application for USCG Type Approval in the fourth quarter of 2017. The first USCG type approvals were granted to competitors in December 2016 and two of these approvals were for UV light-based systems. While we remain confident in our product\u2019s\ncapabilities, there can be no assurance that we will receive USCG type approval or that additional approval of competing systems will not have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to compete in the market for ballast water treatment systems for vessels discharging ballast water in U.S. waterways and ports.\nOur required capital expenditures may exceed estimates.\nOur capital expenditures were $31.9 million in 2016 and are forecasted to be approximately $70 million to $80 million in 2017, including capital expenditures related to the New Business. Future capital expenditures may be significantly higher and may vary substantially if we are required to undertake certain actions to comply with new regulatory requirements or compete with new technologies. We may not have the capital to undertake the capital investments. If we are unable to do so, we may not be able to effectively compete.\nEncroachment into our markets by competitive technologies could adversely affect our financial results.\nActivated carbon is utilized in various applications as a cost-effective solution to solve customer problems. If other competitive technologies, such as membranes, ozone and UV, are advanced to the stage in which such technologies could cost effectively compete with activated carbon technologies, we could experience a decline in net sales, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur industry is highly competitive. If we are unable to compete effectively with competitors having greater resources than we do, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur activated carbon and service business faces significant competition principally from Cabot Norit, the MWV (MeadWestvaco) Specialty Chemicals Division of WestRock Company and Evoqua Water Technologies, as well as from Chinese and European activated carbon producers and East Asian producers of coconut-based activated carbon. Our UV technology products face significant competition principally from Trojan Technologies, Inc., which is owned by Danaher Corporation, and Xylem. Our competitors include major manufacturers and diversified companies, a number of which have revenues and capital resources exceeding ours, which they may use to develop more advanced or more cost-effective technologies, increase market share or leverage their distribution networks. We could experience reduced net sales as a result of having fewer resources than these competitors.\nOur international operations are subject to political and economic risks for conducting business in corrupt environments.\nWe conduct business in developing countries, and we are focusing on increasing our sales in regions such as South America, Southeast Asia, India, China and the Middle East, which are less developed, have less stability in legal systems and financial markets, and are generally recognized as potentially more corrupt business environments than the U.S. and therefore, present greater political, economic and operational risks. We emphasize compliance with the law and have policies in place, procedures and certain ongoing training of employees with regard to business ethics and key legal requirements such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the United Kingdom Bribery Act (UKBA) and all applicable export control laws and regulations of the U.S. and other countries (the Export Regulations); however, there can be no assurances that our employees will adhere to our code of business conduct, other Company policies, the FCPA, the UKBA or the Export Regulations. If we fail to enforce our policies and procedures properly or maintain internal accounting practices to accurately record our international transactions or if we violate any of these laws or regulations, we may be subject to severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, including fines, debarment from export privileges and loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business. We could incur significant costs for investigation, litigation, fees, settlements and judgments which, in turn, could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant stockholders or potential stockholders may attempt to effect changes at the Company or acquire control over the Company, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nStockholders of the Company may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations, advance stockholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes or acquire control over the Company. Campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short-term stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring, increased debt, special dividends, stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire\ncompany. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting the Company\u2019s operations and diverting the attention of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies. As a result, stockholder campaigns could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to innovate new products or applications could adversely affect our ability to meet our strategic growth targets.\nPart of our strategic growth and profitability plans involve the development of new products or new applications for our current products in order to replace more mature products or markets that have seen increased competition. If we are unable to develop new products or applications, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur inability to successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements upon expiration of the existing agreements could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe have collective bargaining agreements in place at six production facilities covering approximately 46% of our full-time workforce as of December 31, 2016. Those collective bargaining agreements expire through 2019. Any work stoppages as a result of disagreements with any of the labor unions or our failure to renegotiate any of the contracts as they expire could disrupt production and significantly increase product costs as a result of less efficient operations caused by the resulting need to rely on temporary labor.\nOur business is subject to a number of global economic risks.\nFinancial markets in the U.S., Europe, and Asia continue to experience disruption, including, among other things, volatility in security prices, diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. Governments have taken actions intending to address these market conditions that include restricted credit and declines in values of certain assets.\nAn economic downturn in the businesses or geographic areas in which we sell our products could reduce demand for our products and result in a decrease in sales volume that could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Continued volatility and disruption of financial markets in the U.S., Europe and Asia could limit our customers\u2019 ability to obtain adequate financing or credit to purchase our products or to maintain operations, and result in a decrease in sales volumes that could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nOur international operations expose us to political and economic uncertainties and risks from abroad, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe have manufacturing facilities and sales offices throughout the world which are subject to economic conditions and political factors within the respective countries which, if changed in a manner adverse to us, could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow. Political risk factors include, but are not limited to, taxation, nationalization, inflation, currency fluctuations, foreign exchange restrictions, increased regulation and quotas, tariffs and other protectionist measures. Approximately 79% of our sales in 2016 were generated by products sold in the U.S., Canada, and Western Europe while the remaining sales were generated in other areas of the world, such as Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America.\nEnvironmental compliance and remediation and potential climate change could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs.\nOur production facilities are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate or maintain properties. Costs may be incurred in complying with such laws and regulations. Each of our domestic production facilities require permits and licenses issued by local, state and federal regulators which regulate air emissions, water discharges, and solid waste handling. These permits are subject to renewal and, in some circumstances, revocation. International environmental requirements vary and could have substantially lesser requirements that may give competitors a competitive advantage. Additional costs may be incurred if environmental remediation measures are required. In addition, the discovery of contamination at any of our current or former sites or at locations at which we dispose of waste may expose us to cleanup obligations and other damages. In addition, there is currently vigorous debate over the effect of CO\u00b2 gas releases and the effect on climate change. Many of our activities create CO\u00b2 gases.\nShould legislation or regulation be enacted, it could have a material adverse effect upon our ability to expand our operations or perhaps continue to operate as we currently do.\nOur financial results could be adversely affected by shortages in energy supply or increases in energy costs.\nThe price for and availability of energy resources could be volatile as it is affected by political and economic conditions that are outside our control. We utilize natural gas as a key component in our activated carbon reactivation manufacturing process at many of our facilities. If shortages of, or restrictions on the delivery of natural gas occur, production at our activated carbon reactivation facilities would be reduced, which could result in missed deliveries or lost sales. We also have exposure to fluctuations in energy costs as they relate to the transportation and distribution of our products. We may not be able to pass through natural gas and other fuel price increases to our customers.\nOur business includes capital equipment sales which could have fluctuations due to the cyclical nature of that type of business.\nOur Equipment segment represented approximately 8% of our 2016 net sales. This business generally has a long project life cycle from bid solicitation to project completion and often requires customers to make large capital commitments well in advance of project execution. In addition, this business is usually affected by the general health of the overall economy. As a result, sales and earnings from the Equipment segment could be volatile.\nOur products could infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to pay unexpected litigation costs or damages or prevent us from selling our products.\nAlthough it is our intention to avoid infringing or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of others, our products may infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims, including claims of alleged infringement by us of the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. Intellectual property litigation is expensive and time-consuming, regardless of the merits of any claim.\nIf we were to discover or be notified that our products potentially infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, we may need to obtain licenses from these parties or substantially re-engineer our products in order to avoid infringement. We might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms, or at all, or be able to re-engineer our products successfully. Moreover, if we are sued for infringement and lose the suit, we could be required to pay substantial damages and/or be enjoined from using or selling the infringing products. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products.\nDeclines in the operating performance of one of our business segments could result in an impairment of the segment\u2019s goodwill.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had consolidated goodwill of approximately $66.3 million, of which $41.0 million is related to the acquisition of the New Business reported in Other. The remaining $25.3 million of goodwill is primarily from our Activated Carbon and Service and Equipment segments. We test our goodwill on an annual basis or when an indication of possible impairment exists in order to determine whether the carrying value of our assets is still supported by the fair value of the underlying business. To the extent that it is not, we are required to record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to fair value. A decline in the operating performance of any of our business segments could result in a goodwill impairment charge which could have a material effect on our financial results.\nOur pension plans are currently underfunded, and we could be subject to increases in pension contributions to our defined benefit pension plans, thereby restricting our cash flow.\nWe sponsor various pension plans in the U.S. and Europe that are underfunded and may require significant cash payments. We contributed $0.7 million and $1.3 million to our U.S. pension plans and $1.7 million and $1.8 million to our European pension plans in 2016 and 2015, respectively. We currently expect to contribute in 2017 approximately $2.9 million to our U.S. plans and $1.7 million to our European plans to meet minimum funding requirements, in accordance with our funding policy.\nThe funding status of our pension plans is determined using many assumptions, such as inflation, rates of return on investments, mortality, turnover and interest rates, any of which could prove to be different than projected. If the performance of the assets in our pension plans does not meet our expectations, or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, or not realized, we may be required to contribute more to our pension plans than we currently expect. For example, an approximate 25-basis point decline in the funding target interest rate under Section 430 of the Internal Revenue Code, as added by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 for minimum funding requirements, would increase our minimum required funding policy contributions to our U.S. pension plans by approximately $1.0 million to $2.0 million over the next three fiscal years. This amount reflects the provisions of Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) and the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 (HAFTA), both of which affect pension plan funding.\nOur pension plans are underfunded in the aggregate by approximately $38 million as of December 31, 2016 based on comparing the projected benefit obligation, calculated using actuarial assumptions in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 715 \u201cCompensation - Retirement Benefits,\u201d to the fair value of plan assets. Our U.S. pension plans, which were underfunded by approximately $22 million as of December 31, 2016, are subject to ERISA. In the event our U.S. pension plans are terminated for any reason while the plans are less than fully funded, we will incur a liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation that may be equal to the entire amount of the underfunding at the time of the termination. In addition, changes in required pension funding rules that were affected by the enactment of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 have significantly increased funding requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flows. If cash flows from operations are insufficient to fund our worldwide pension liability, we may be required to reduce or delay capital expenditures, or to seek additional capital. Refer to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting that, if not properly corrected, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nAs described in the Report of Management in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\" we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2016 because a material weakness existed in our internal control over financial reporting related to the recognition of revenue for a subset of transactions within the U.S. potable water market.\nManagement has identified actions that the Company intends to implement immediately in order to remediate this material weakness. However, we have not completed all of the corrective actions that we believe are necessary. As we continue to evaluate and work to remediate the material weakness, we may implement additional measures. The actions we are taking to remediate the material weakness are subject to ongoing senior management review, as well as oversight by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nIf our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results, which could adversely affect our stock price and result in our inability to maintain compliance with applicable stock exchange listing requirements.\nExisting and future laws, regulations and other legal requirements relating to our business may increase our costs of doing business and may expose us to liability.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal, state and local authorities, as well as foreign authorities relating to various matters, including the protection of our workers, our consumers and the environment. Complying with these requirements has had, and will continue to have an effect on our costs of operations and competitive position. In addition, there is the possibility that we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations under these laws or be subject to governmental orders which cause us to alter our operations or expend substantial resources to comply with such orders. Any additional laws, regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal, state and local authorities, as well as foreign authorities or new interpretations of existing legal requirements by regulatory bodies could further affect our costs of operations and competitive position. For example, as a result of our acquisition of the New Business in late 2016, we may be subject to additional regulations currently under consideration related to the effects of crystalline silica. If such regulations are ultimately adopted, we\nmay need to expend substantial resources to comply with these regulations and if we fail to comply with these new regulations we could be subject to fines, penalties and other liabilities.\nOur future success may be dependent upon the successful integration of our acquisitions and reaping the anticipated benefits from those acquisitions.\nWe may make acquisitions of businesses that complement or expand our current business. No assurance can be given that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms, obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire the identified targets. The success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to effectively integrate the acquired business into our existing operations and obtain the benefits contemplated at the time we made the acquisition. The process of integrating and operating any acquired business may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. Our failure to successfully integrate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations and achieve the anticipated benefits from those acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of our Company.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. These include provisions:\n\u00b7\nproviding for a board of directors with staggered, three-year terms;\n\u00b7\nrequiring super-majority voting to affect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u00b7\nlimiting the persons who may call special stockholders\u2019 meetings;\n\u00b7\nlimiting stockholder action by written consent;\n\u00b7\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholders\u2019 meetings; and\n\u00b7\nallowing our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nThese provisions, alone or in combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our common stock, or could limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interest.\nThe security of our information technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nIncreased global information technology security requirements, threats and sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data, our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches. This could lead to negative publicity, theft, modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information, manufacture of defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 11378, "SIC": 2810, "TIC": "CCC.1"}
