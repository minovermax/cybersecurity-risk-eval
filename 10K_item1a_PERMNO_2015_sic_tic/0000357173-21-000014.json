Risk Factors\nThere are risks, many beyond our control, which could cause our results to differ significantly from management\u2019s expectations. Some of these risk factors are described below. Any factor described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could, by itself or together with one or more other factors, adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to not be material also may materially and adversely affect us. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to other information disclosed in our SEC filings, including the financial statements and notes thereto. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ substantially from those discussed or implied in these forward-looking statements.\nCOVID-19 and Economic-Related Risks\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the ultimate effect of the pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments and other factors that are highly uncertain.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic and related government-imposed and other measures intended to control the spread of the disease, including restrictions on travel and the conduct of business, such as stay-at-home orders, quarantines, travel bans, border closings, business and school closures and other similar measures, have had a significant impact on global economic conditions and have negatively impacted certain aspects of our business, financial condition and results of operations, and may continue to do so in the future. The governmental and social response to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented slow-down in economic activity and a related increase in unemployment. The COVID-19 pandemic, and related efforts to contain it, have also caused significant disruptions in the functioning of the financial markets and have increased economic and market uncertainty and volatility.\nGiven the ongoing, dynamic and unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult to predict the full impact the pandemic will have on our business. While certain factors point to improving economic conditions, uncertainty remains regarding the path of the economic recovery, the mitigating impacts of government interventions, the success of vaccine distribution and the efficacy of administered vaccines, as well as the effects of the change in leadership resulting from the recent elections. The COVID-19 pandemic may subject us to any of the following risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, risk-weighted assets and regulatory capital:\n\u2022 because the incidence of reported COVID-19 cases and related hospitalizations and deaths varies significantly by state and locality, the economic downturn caused by the pandemic may be deeper and more sustained in certain areas, including those in which we do business, relative to other areas of the country;\n\u2022 our ability to market our products and services may be impaired by a variety of external factors, including a prolonged reduction in economic activity and continued economic and financial market volatility, which could cause demand for our products and services to decline, in turn making it difficult for us to grow assets and income;\n\u2022 if the economy is unable to substantially reopen and high levels of unemployment continue for an extended period of time, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase, resulting in increased charges and reduced income;\n\u2022 collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which may reduce our ability to liquidate such collateral and could cause loan losses to increase and impair our ability over the long run to maintain our targeted loan origination volume;\n\u2022 our allowance for credit losses may have to be increased if borrowers experience financial difficulties beyond forbearance periods, which will adversely affect our net income;\n\u2022 an increase in non-performing loans due to the COVID-19 pandemic would result in a corresponding increase in the risk-weighting of assets and therefore an increase in required regulatory capital;\n\u2022 the net worth and liquidity of borrowers and loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us;\n\u2022 as the result of the reduction of the Federal Reserve\u2019s target federal funds rate to near 0%, the yield on our assets may decline to a greater extent than the decline in our cost of interest-bearing liabilities, reducing our net interest margin and spread and reducing net income;\n\u2022 deposits could decline if customers need to draw on available balances as a result of the economic downturn;\n\u2022 a material decrease in net income or a net loss over several quarters could result in a decrease in the rate of our quarterly cash dividend;\n\u2022 the borrowing needs of our clients may increase, especially during this challenging economic environment, which could result in increased borrowing against our contractual obligations to extend credit;\n\u2022 we face heightened cybersecurity risk in connection with our operation of a remote working environment, which risks include, among others, greater phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks, vulnerability to disruptions of our information technology infrastructure and telecommunications systems, increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of confidential information, limited ability to restore our systems in the event of a systems failure or interruption, greater risk of a security breach resulting in destruction or misuse of valuable information, and potential impairment of our ability to perform critical functions-all of which could expose us to risks of data or financial loss, litigation and liability and could seriously disrupt our operations and the operations of any impacted customers;\n\u2022 we rely on third party vendors for certain services and the unavailability of a critical service or limitations on the business capacities of our vendors for extended periods of time due to the COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse effect on our operations; and\n\u2022 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there may be unexpected developments in financial markets, legislation, regulations and consumer and customer behavior.\nEven after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the virus\u2019s global economic impact, including the availability of credit, adverse impacts on our liquidity and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business, our operations or the global economy as a whole. However, the effects could have a material impact on our results of operations and heighten many of our known risks described herein.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a higher allowance for credit losses (\u201cACL\u201d) determined in accordance with the Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL standard, and may result in increased volatility and further increases in our allowance for credit losses.\nThe measure of our ACL is dependent on the adoption and interpretation of applicable accounting standards. The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new credit impairment model, the Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL standard, which has become effective and was adopted by us in the first quarter of 2020. Under the CECL model, we are required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount and certain management judgments over the life of the loan. This initial measurement took place as of January 1, 2020, at the time of our adoption of CECL, and measurements occurred periodically thereafter. The adoption of the CECL model has materially affected how we determine our ACL and, combined with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, required us to significantly increase our allowance during 2020. As of the date of adoption, the allowance for credit losses on loans increased $5.9 million, and the allowance for unfunded commitments increased by approximately $1.7 million, resulting in a corresponding $2.5 million increase to loans for the reclassified credit-related component of purchase credit deteriorated (\u201cPCD\u201d) loans and a $3.8 million decrease in retained earnings, net of an adjustment to deferred tax assets of $1.4 million. Provision expense of $10.4 million was recorded during 2020, comprised of $9.2 million for the provision for credit losses on loans, and $1.2 million for the provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments.\nThe CECL model is anticipated to create more volatility in the level of our ACL, as compared to the \u201cincurred loss\u201d standard that we previously applied prior to 2020 in determining our allowance. The CECL model requires us to estimate the lifetime \u201cexpected credit loss\u201d with respect to loans and other applicable financial assets, which may change more rapidly than the level of \u201cincurred losses\u201d that would have been used to determine our allowance for loan losses under the prior incurred loss standard. The potentially material effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on lifetime expected credit loss, and the challenges associated with estimating lifetime credit losses in view of the uncertain ultimate impacts of the pandemic, may result in increased volatility and significant additions to our ACL in the future, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected by economic conditions.\nOur financial performance generally, and in particular, the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer and whose success we rely on to drive our growth, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the primary markets where we operate and in the\nUnited States as a whole. Unlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, our banking franchise is concentrated in Aurora, Illinois, and its surrounding communities, as well as Cook County. The city of Aurora is located in northeastern Illinois, approximately 40 miles west of Chicago. In addition, the State of Illinois continues to experience severe fiscal challenges, which could result in future state tax increases, impact the economic vitality of the businesses operating in Illinois, encourage businesses to leave the state or discourage new employers to start or move businesses to Illinois, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nUnfavorable market conditions can result in a deterioration in the credit quality of our borrowers and the demand for our products and services, an increase in the number of loan delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs, foreclosures, additional provisions for loan losses, adverse asset values of the collateral securing our loans and an overall material adverse effect on the quality of our loan portfolio, and a reduction in assets under management or administration. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability of or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment; natural disasters; epidemics and pandemics (such as COVID-19); state or local government insolvency; or a combination of these or other factors.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve and there is pervasive uncertainty surrounding the future economic conditions that will emerge in the months and years following the onset of the pandemic. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy will likely require some time to recover from its effects, the length of which is unknown, and during which we may experience a recession. In addition, there are continuing concerns related to, among other things, the level of U.S. government debt and fiscal actions that may be taken to address that debt, depressed oil prices and a potential resurgence of economic and political tensions with China that may have a destabilizing effect on financial markets and economic activity. Economic pressure on consumers and overall economic uncertainty may result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing and saving habits. These economic conditions and/or other negative developments in the domestic or international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Declines in real estate values and sales volumes and high unemployment or underemployment may also result in higher than expected loan delinquencies, increases in our levels of nonperforming and classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services. These negative events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur trust and wealth management business may be negatively impacted by changes in economic and market conditions and clients may seek legal remedies for investment performance.\nOur trust and wealth management business may be negatively impacted by changes in general economic and market conditions because the performance of this businesses is directly affected by conditions in the financial and securities markets. The financial markets and businesses operating in the securities industry are highly volatile (meaning that performance results can vary greatly within short periods of time) and are directly affected by, among other factors, domestic and foreign economic conditions and general trends in business and finance, and by the threat, as well as the occurrence of global conflicts, all of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that broad market performance will be favorable in the future. Declines in the financial markets or a lack of sustained growth may result in a decline in the performance of our wealth management business and may adversely affect the market value and performance of the investment securities that we manage, which could lead to reductions in our wealth management fees, because they are based primarily on the market value of the securities we manage, and could lead some of our clients to reduce their assets under management by us or seek legal remedies for investment performance. If any of these events occur, the financial performance of our wealth management business could be materially and adversely affected.\nCredit and Interest Rate Risks\nIf we fail to effectively manage credit risk, our business and financial condition will suffer.\nWe must effectively manage credit risk. As a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers will be unable to repay their loans according to their original contractual terms, and that the collateral securing repayment of their loans, if any, may not be sufficient to ensure repayment. This risk has been and may be further exacerbated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, there are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks relating to proper loan underwriting, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, including the risk that a borrower may not provide information to us about its business in a timely manner, and/or may present inaccurate or incomplete information to us, and risks relating to the value of collateral. In order to manage credit risk successfully, we must, among other things, maintain disciplined and prudent underwriting standards and ensure that our lenders follow those standards. The weakening of these standards for any reason, such as an attempt to attract higher yielding loans, a lack of discipline or diligence by our employees in underwriting and monitoring loans, the inability of our employees to adequately adapt policies and procedures to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting borrowers and the quality of our loan portfolio, may result in loan defaults, foreclosures and additional charge-offs and may necessitate that we significantly increase our allowance for credit losses, each of which could adversely affect our net income. Our inability to successfully manage credit risk could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur allowance for credit losses, or ACL, and fair value adjustments with respect to acquired loans, may be insufficient to absorb potential losses in our loan portfolio, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends significantly on the quality of our assets, particularly loans. Like other financial institutions, we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers may not repay their loans according to their terms, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to fully compensate us for the outstanding balance of the loan plus the costs to dispose of the collateral. As a result, we may experience significant loan, lease or commitment credit losses that may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe maintain an ACL at a level we believe is adequate to absorb estimated credit losses that are expected to occur within the existing loan portfolio through their contractual terms. The level of the ACL is inherently subjective and is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the performance of the loan portfolio, consideration of current economic trends, changes in interest rates and property values, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on an analysis that uses historical loss experience for prior periods that are determined to have like characteristics with management\u2019s economic forecast period, such as pre-recessionary, recessionary, or recovery periods, portfolio growth and concentration risk, management and staffing changes, the interpretation of loan risk classifications by regulatory authorities and other credit market factors. We expect economic uncertainty to continue into 2021, which may result in a significant increase to our ACL in future periods. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our ACL and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of management. If charge-offs in future periods exceed the ACL, we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance. Any increases in the ACL will result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may be required to make significant increases in the provision for credit losses and to charge-off additional loans in the future.\nThe application of the purchase method of accounting in any future acquisitions will impact our ACL. Under the purchase method of accounting, all acquired loans are recorded in our consolidated financial statements at their estimated fair value at the time of acquisition and any related ACL is eliminated because credit quality, among other factors, is considered in the determination of fair value. To the extent that our estimates of fair value are too high, we will incur losses associated with the acquired loans.\nOur loan portfolio is concentrated heavily in commercial and residential real estate loans, including exposure to construction loans, which involve risks specific to real estate values and the real estate markets in general.\nOur loan portfolio generally reflects the profile of the communities in which we operate. Because we operate in areas that saw rapid historical growth, real estate lending of all types is a significant portion of our loan portfolio. Total real estate lending was $1.48 billion, or approximately 72.5%, of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2020, compared to $1.46 billion, or approximately 75.4%, at December 31, 2019. Given that the primary (if not only) source of collateral on these loans is real estate, adverse developments affecting real estate values in our market area could increase the credit risk associated with our real estate loan portfolio.\nIn addition, with respect to commercial real estate loans, the banking regulators are examining commercial real estate lending activity with greater scrutiny, and may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement improved underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies and portfolio stress testing, as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for credit losses and capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending growth and exposures. At December 31, 2020, our outstanding commercial real estate loans, including owner occupied real estate, and undrawn commercial real estate commitments were equal to 274.1% of our Tier 1 capital plus allowance for loan and lease losses, which is under our policy limit and regulatory guidance of 300%. If our regulators require us to maintain higher levels of capital than we would otherwise be expected to maintain, this could limit our ability to leverage our capital and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nReal estate market volatility and future changes in disposition strategies could result in net proceeds that differ significantly from our fair value appraisals of loan collateral and OREO and could negatively impact our operating performance.\nMany of our nonperforming real estate loans are collateral-dependent, meaning the repayment of the loan is largely dependent upon the value of the property securing the loan and the borrower\u2019s ability to refinance, recapitalize or sell the property. For collateral-dependent loans, we estimate the value of the loan based on the appraised value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. Our OREO portfolio essentially consists of properties acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure in partial or total satisfaction of certain loans as a result of borrower defaults. Some property in OREO reflects property formerly utilized as a bank premise or land that was acquired with the expectation that a bank premise would be established at the location. In some cases, the market for such properties has been significantly depressed, and we have been unable to sell them at prices or within timeframes that we deem acceptable. OREO is recorded at the fair value of the property when acquired, less estimated selling costs. In determining the value of OREO properties and loan collateral, an orderly disposition of the property is generally assumed. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of property, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility. In response to market conditions and other economic factors, we may utilize alternative sale strategies other than orderly disposition as part of our OREO disposition strategy, such as immediate liquidation sales. In this event, as a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of disposition, the net proceeds realized from\nsuch sales transactions could differ significantly from appraisals, comparable sales and other estimates used to determine the fair value of our OREO properties.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk, and a change in interest rates could have a negative effect on our net income.\nOur earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, our competition and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy could influence our earnings. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest-earning assets in a period, an increase in interest rates could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income. Additionally, an increase in the general level of interest rates may also, among other things, adversely affect our current borrowers\u2019 ability to repay variable rate loans, the demand for loans and our ability to originate loans and decrease loan prepayment rates. Conversely, a decrease in the general level of interest rates, among other things, may lead to increased prepayments on our loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolios and increased competition for deposits. Accordingly, changes in the general level of market interest rates may adversely affect our net yield on interest-earning assets, loan origination volume and our overall results.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FOMC cut short-term interest rates to a record low range of 0% to 0.25%, and the Federal Reserve has indicated it expects rates to remain within this range through 2023 and possibly longer. If short-term interest rates continue to remain at their historically low levels for a prolonged period and assuming longer-term interest rates fall further, we could experience net interest margin compression as our interest-earning assets would continue to reprice downward while our interest-bearing liability rates could fail to decline in tandem, which would have an adverse effect on our net interest income and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations, any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nNonperforming assets take significant time to resolve, adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and could result in further losses in the future.\nOur nonperforming loans (which consist of nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more still accruing interest and restructured loans still accruing interest), were $23.0 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of 45.4%, compared to $15.8 million at December 31, 2019. Other real estate owned, or OREO, totaled $2.5 million at December 31, 2020, a decreased of 50.6%, compared to $5.0 million at December 31, 2019. In 2019, we did not consider our purchased credit impaired loans, or PCI loans, to be nonperforming assets as long as their cash flows and the timing of such cash flows continue to be estimable and probable of collection, because we recognized interest income on these loans through accretion of the difference between the carrying value of these loans and the present value of expected future cash flows. As a result, management excluded PCI loans from nonperforming assets for 2019. After the adoption of CECL as of January 1, 2020, the credit adjustment outstanding on PCI loans was reclassified to the allowance for credit losses, and PCI loans became purchase credit deteriorated, or PCD loans; all PCD loans are now included within each relevant loan type and are not separately reported as PCI loans, because such loans are now included within the Company\u2019s nonperforming loan disclosures, if such loans otherwise meet the definition of a nonperforming loan.\nOur nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. For example, we do not accrue interest income on nonaccrual loans and OREO may have expenses in excess of any lease revenues collected, thereby adversely affecting our net income, return on assets and return on equity. Our loan administration costs also increase because of our nonperforming assets. The resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant time commitments from management, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. There is no assurance that we will not experience increases in nonperforming assets in the future, or that our nonperforming assets will not result in losses in the future.\nOperational Risks\nWe are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nWe are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values: being an integral part of the communities we serve; delivering superior service to our customers; and caring about our customers and associates. Damage to our reputation could undermine the confidence of our current and potential clients in our ability to provide financial services. Such damage could also impair the confidence of our counterparties and business partners, and ultimately affect our ability to effect transactions. Maintenance of our reputation depends not only on our success in maintaining our core values and controlling and mitigating the various risks described herein, but also on our success in identifying and appropriately addressing issues that may arise in areas such as potential conflicts of interest, anti-money laundering, client personal information and privacy issues, record-keeping, regulatory investigations and any litigation that may arise from the failure or perceived failure of us to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. If our reputation is negatively affected, by the actions of our employees or otherwise, our business and,\ntherefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected. Further, negative public opinion can expose us to litigation and regulatory action as we seek to implement our growth strategy, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and market area and may face severe competitive disadvantages.\nWe face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and have more financial resources. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, other financial service businesses, including investment advisory and wealth management firms, mutual fund companies, and securities brokerage and investment banking firms, as well as super-regional, national and international financial institutions that operate offices in our primary market areas and elsewhere. Local competitors continue to expand their presence in the western suburbs of Chicago, including the communities that surround Aurora, Illinois, and these competitors may be better positioned than us to compete for loans, acquisitions and personnel. As customers\u2019 preferences and expectations continue to evolve, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the Internet and for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as business and consumer lending, automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. There has also been significant advancement in the exchange of digital assets (\u201ccryptocurrency\u201d) that could materially impact the financial services industry in the future. Because of this rapidly changing technology, our future success will depend in part on our ability to address our customers\u2019 needs by using technology. Customer loyalty can be easily influenced by a competitor\u2019s new products, especially offerings that could provide cost savings or a higher return to the customer. Moreover, the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative and regulatory changes, and many large scale competitors can leverage economies of scale to offer better pricing for products and services compared to what we can offer.\nWe compete with these institutions in attracting deposits and assets under management, processing payment transactions, and in making loans. We may not be able to compete successfully with other financial institutions in our markets, particularly with larger financial institutions operating in our markets that have significantly greater resources than us and offer financial products and services that we are unable to offer, putting us at a disadvantage in competing with them for loans and deposits and wealth management clients, and we may have to pay higher interest rates to attract deposits, accept lower yields on loans to attract loans and pay higher wages for new employees, resulting in lower net interest margin and reduced profitability. In addition, competitors that are not depository institutions are generally not subject to the extensive regulations that apply to us. If we are unable to compete effectively with those banking or other financial services businesses, we could find it more difficult to attract new and retain existing clients and our net interest margin, net interest income and wealth management fees could decline, which would adversely affect our results of operations and could cause us to incur losses in the future.\nIn addition, our ability to successfully attract and retain wealth management clients is dependent on our ability to compete with competitors\u2019 investment products, level of investment performance, client services and marketing and distribution capabilities. If we are not successful in attracting new and retaining existing clients, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend on our executive officers and other key employees, and our ability to attract additional key personnel, to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy, and we could be harmed by the unexpected loss of their services.\nWe believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our executive officers and other key employees and our ability to motivate and retain these individuals, as well as our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified senior and middle management and other skilled employees. Our business is primarily relationship-driven in that many of our key personnel have extensive customer or asset management relationships. Loss of key personnel with such relationships may lead to the loss of business if the customers were to follow that employee to a competitor or if asset management expertise was not replaced in a timely manner. Competition for employees is intense, and the process of locating key personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to execute our business strategy may be lengthy. We may not be successful in retaining key personnel, and the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business because of their skill, knowledge of our primary markets, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. If the services of any of our key personnel should become unavailable for any reason, we may not be able to identify and hire qualified persons on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and future prospects.\nIf we are unable to offer our key management personnel long-term incentive compensation, including options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units, as part of their total compensation package, we may have difficulty retaining such personnel, which would adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\nWe have historically granted equity awards, including restricted stock units and stock options, to key management personnel as part of a competitive compensation package. Our ability to grant equity compensation awards as a part of our total compensation package has been vital to attracting, retaining and aligning stockholder interest with a talented management team in a highly competitive marketplace.\nIn the future, we may seek stockholder approval to adopt or amend equity compensation plans so that we may issue additional equity awards to management in order for the equity component of our compensation packages to remain competitive in the industry. Stockholder advisory groups have implemented guidelines and issued voting recommendations related to how much equity companies should be able to grant to employees. These advisors influence certain shareholder votes regarding approval of a company\u2019s request for approval of new equity compensation plans. The factors used to formulate these guidelines and voting recommendations include the volatility of a company\u2019s share price and are influenced by broader macro-economic conditions that can change year to year. The variables used by stockholder advisory groups to formulate equity plan recommendations may limit our ability to obtain approval to adopt or amend equity plans in the future. If we are limited in our ability to grant equity compensation awards, we would need to explore offering other compelling alternatives to supplement our compensation, including long-term cash compensation plans or significantly increased short-term cash compensation, in order to continue to attract and retain key management personnel. If we used these alternatives to long-term equity awards, our compensation costs could increase and our financial performance could be adversely affected. If we are unable to offer key management personnel long-term incentive compensation, including stock options, restricted stock or restricted stock units, as part of their total compensation package, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining such personnel, which would adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\nWe depend on outside third parties for the processing and handling of our records and data.\nWe rely on software developed by third party vendors to process various Company transactions. In some cases, we have contracted with third parties to run their proprietary software on our behalf at a location under the control of the third party. These systems include, but are not limited to, core data processing, payroll, loan origination, wealth management record keeping, and securities portfolio management. While we perform a review of controls instituted by the vendor over these programs in accordance with industry standards and institute our own user controls, we must rely on the continued maintenance of the performance controls by these outside parties, including safeguards over the security of customer data. In addition, we create backup copies of key processing output daily in the event of a failure on the part of any of these systems. Nonetheless, we may incur a temporary disruption in our ability to conduct our business or process our transactions, or incur damage to our reputation if a third-party vendor fails to adequately maintain internal controls or institute necessary changes to systems. A disruption or breach of security may ultimately have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur use of third party vendors and our other ongoing third party business relationships are subject to regulatory requirements and attention.\nWe regularly use third party vendors as part of our business. We also have substantial ongoing business relationships with other third parties. These types of third party relationships are subject to demanding regulatory requirements and attention by our federal bank regulators. Recent regulation requires us to enhance our due diligence, risk assessment, ongoing monitoring and control over our third party vendors and other ongoing third party business relationships. We expect that our regulators will hold us responsible for deficiencies in our oversight and control of our third party relationships and in the performance of the parties with which we have these relationships. As a result, if our regulators conclude that we have not exercised adequate oversight and control over our third party vendors or other ongoing third party business relationships or that such third parties have not performed appropriately, we could be subject to enforcement actions, including civil money penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation, any of which could have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are at risk of increased losses from fraud.\nCriminals committing fraud increasingly are using more sophisticated techniques and in some cases are part of larger criminal rings, which allow them to be more effective. The fraudulent activity has taken many forms, ranging from check fraud, mechanical devices attached to ATMs, social engineering and phishing attacks to obtain personal information or impersonation of our clients through the use of falsified or stolen credentials. Additionally, an individual or business entity may properly identify themselves, particularly when banking online, yet seek to establish a business relationship for the purpose of perpetrating fraud. Further, in addition to fraud committed against us, we may suffer losses as a result of fraudulent activity committed against third parties. Increased deployment of technologies, such as chip card technology, defray and reduce aspects of fraud; however, criminals are turning to other sources to steal personally identifiable information, such as unaffiliated healthcare providers and government entities, in order to impersonate the consumer to commit fraud. Many of these data compromises are widely reported in the media. Further, as a result of the increased sophistication of fraud activity, we have increased our spending on systems and controls to detect and prevent fraud. This will result in continued ongoing investments in the future.\nPrivacy and Technology-Related Risks\nFailure to keep pace with technological change could adversely affect our business.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our\noperations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security and cyber-attacks, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely heavily on internal and outsourced technologies, communications, and information systems to conduct our business. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential information regarding our customers. As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the potential risks of a technology-related operation interruption (such as disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan, or other systems) or the occurrence of a cyber-attack (such as unauthorized access to our systems). These risks have increased for all financial institutions as new technologies have emerged, including the use of the Internet and the expansion of telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions, and as the sophistication of organized criminals, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others have increased.\nIn addition to cyber-attacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers have engaged in attacks against large financial institutions, particularly denial of service attacks that are designed to disrupt key business services, such as customer-facing web sites. We operate in an industry where otherwise effective preventive measures against security breaches become vulnerable as breach strategies change frequently and cyber-attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. It is possible that a cyber-incident, such as a security breach, may be undetected for a period of time. However, applying guidance from the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, we have identified security risks and employ risk mitigation controls. Following a layered security approach, we have analyzed and will continue to analyze security related to device specific considerations, user access topics, transaction-processing and network integrity. We expect that we will spend additional time and will incur additional costs going forward to modify and enhance protective measures and that effort and spending will continue to be required to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nWe also face risks related to cyber-attacks and other security breaches in connection with credit card and debit card transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding our customers through various third parties, including merchant-acquiring banks, payment processors, payment card networks and their processors. Some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyber-attacks. Because these third parties and related environments such as the point-of-sale are not under our direct control, future security breaches or cyber-attacks affecting any of these third parties could impact us and in some cases we may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks. We offer our customers protection against fraud and attendant losses for unauthorized use of debit cards in order to stay competitive in the marketplace. Offering such protection exposes us to potential losses which, in the event of a data breach at one or more retailers of considerable magnitude, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operation. Further cyber-attacks or other breaches in the future, whether affecting us or others, could intensify consumer concern and regulatory focus and result in reduced use of payment cards and increased costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent we are involved in any future cyber-attacks or other breaches, our reputation could be affected which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nGrowth and Strategic Risks\nWe may not be able to implement our growth strategy or manage costs effectively, resulting in lower earnings or profitability.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to grow and to be profitable in future periods, or, if profitable, that our overall earnings will remain consistent or increase in the future. Our strategy is focused on organic growth, supplemented by opportunistic acquisitions, such as our acquisition of ABC Bank. Our growth requires that we increase our loans and deposits while managing risks by following prudent loan underwriting standards without increasing interest rate risk or compressing our net interest margin, maintaining more than adequate capital and liquidity levels at all times, hiring and retaining qualified employees and successfully implementing strategic projects and initiatives. Even if we are able to increase our interest income, our earnings may nonetheless be reduced by increased expenses, such as additional employee compensation or other general and administrative expenses and increased interest expense on any liabilities incurred or deposits solicited to fund increases in assets. Additionally, if our competitors extend credit on terms we find to pose excessive risks, or at interest rates which we believe do not warrant the credit exposure, we may not be able to maintain our lending volume and could experience deteriorating financial performance. Our inability to manage our growth successfully or to continue to expand into new markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur strategic growth plans contemplate additional organic growth and potential growth through additional mergers and acquisitions, which exposes us to additional risks.\nOur strategic growth plans include organic growth and growth through additional mergers and acquisitions. To the extent that we are unable to increase loans through organic loan growth, or to identify and consummate attractive acquisitions, we may be unable to successfully implement our growth strategy, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and earnings.\nWe routinely evaluate opportunities to acquire additional financial institutions or branches or to open new branches. As a result, we regularly engage in discussions or negotiations that, if they were to result in a transaction, could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition, including short- and long-term liquidity. Our merger and acquisition activities could be material and could require us to use a substantial amount of common stock, cash, other liquid assets, and/or incur debt. In addition, if goodwill recorded in connection with our prior or potential future acquisitions were determined to be impaired, then we would be required to recognize a charge against our earnings, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations during the period in which the impairment was recognized. Moreover, these types of expansions involve various risks, including:\nManagement of Growth. We may be unable to successfully:\n\u25cf maintain loan quality in the context of significant loan growth;\n\u25cf identify and expand into suitable markets;\n\u25cf obtain regulatory and other approvals necessary to consummate mergers, acquisitions or other expansion activities, or regulatory approvals may be delayed, impeded, or conditioned due to existing or new regulatory issues surrounding us, the target institution or the proposed combined entity as a result of, among other things, issues related to anti-money laundering/Bank Secrecy Act compliance, fair lending laws, fair housing laws, consumer protection laws, unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices regulations, or the Community Reinvestment Act;\n\u25cf retain employees and customers of the Company or the businesses that we acquire or merge with;\n\u25cf attract sufficient deposits and capital to fund anticipated loan growth;\n\u25cf maintain adequate common equity and regulatory capital;\n\u25cf avoid diversion or disruption of our management and existing operations as well as those of the acquired or merged institution;\n\u25cf maintain adequate management personnel and systems to oversee such growth;\n\u25cf maintain adequate internal audit, risk management, loan review and compliance functions; and\n\u25cf implement additional policies, procedures and operating systems required to support such growth.\nOperating Results. There is no assurance that existing branches or future branches will maintain or achieve deposit levels, loan balances or other operating results necessary to avoid losses or produce profits. Our growth may entail an increase in overhead expenses as we add new branches and staff. There are considerable costs involved in opening branches, and new branches generally do not generate sufficient revenues to offset their costs until they have been in operation for at least a year or more. Accordingly, any new branches we establish can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until they reach certain economies of scale. Our historical results may not be indicative of future results or results that may be achieved, particularly if we continue to expand.\nFailure to successfully address these and other issues related to our expansion could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including short-term and long-term liquidity, and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy.\nWe may be exposed to difficulties in combining the operations of acquired or merged businesses into our own operations, which may prevent us from achieving the expected benefits from our merger and acquisition activities.\nWe may not be able to fully achieve the strategic objectives and operating efficiencies that we anticipate in our merger and acquisition activities. Inherent uncertainties exist in integrating the operations of an acquired or merged business. We may lose our customers or the customers of acquired or merged entities as a result of an acquisition. We may also lose key personnel from the acquired entity as a result of an acquisition. We may not discover all known and unknown factors when examining a company for acquisition or merger during the due diligence period. These factors could produce unintended and unexpected consequences for us. Undiscovered factors as a result of an acquisition or merger could bring civil, criminal, and financial liabilities against us, our management, and the management of those entities we acquire or merge with. In addition, if difficulties arise with respect to the integration process, the economic benefits expected to result from acquisitions and mergers might not occur. Failure to successfully integrate businesses that we acquire or merge with could have an adverse effect on our profitability, return on equity, return on assets, or our ability to implement our strategy, any of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These factors could contribute to our not achieving the expected benefits from our mergers and acquisitions within desired time frames, if at all.\nNew lines of business, products, product enhancements or services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new products, and product enhancements as well as new services within our existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances\nin which the markets are not fully developed. In implementing, developing or marketing new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services, we may invest significant time and resources, although we may not assign the appropriate level of resources or expertise necessary to make these new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services successful or to realize their expected benefits. Further, initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. The introduction of such new products requires continued innovative efforts on the part of our management and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also affect the ultimate implementation of a new line of business or offerings of new products, product enhancements or services. Furthermore, any new line of business, product, product enhancement or service or system conversion could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or offerings of new products, product enhancements or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIndustry-Related Risks\nThe phase-out of LIBOR could negatively impact our net interest income and require significant operational work.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), has announced that it will not compel panel banks to contribute to LIBOR after 2021. The discontinuance of LIBOR has resulted in significant uncertainty regarding the transition to suitable alternative reference rates and could adversely impact our business, operations, and financial results.\nThe Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, has endorsed replacing the U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities (\u201cSOFR\u201d). SOFR is observed and backward looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). In November 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a statement that says that banks may use any reference rate for its loans that the bank determines to be appropriate for its funding model and customer needs.\nWe have substantial exposure to LIBOR-based products, including loans, securities, derivatives and hedges, and we are preparing to transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we began the process of incorporating fallback language in legacy LIBOR-based commercial loans, and we plan to begin indexing new retail adjustable rate mortgages to SOFR in the second quarter of 2021. We continue to monitor market developments and regulatory updates, including recent announcements from the ICE Benchmark Administrator to extend the cessation date for several USD LIBOR tenors to June 30, 2023, as well as collaborate with regulators and industry groups on the transition. The manner and impact of this transition, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, loan and investment and trading securities portfolios, asset-liability management, and business, is uncertain.\nOur estimate of fair values for our investments may not be realizable if we were to sell these securities today.\nOur available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value. The determination of fair value for securities categorized in Level 3 involves significant judgment due to the complexity of the factors contributing to the valuation, many of which are not readily observable in the market. Recent market disruptions and the resulting fluctuations in fair value have made the valuation process even more difficult and subjective. If the valuations are incorrect, it could harm our financial results and financial condition.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market purchases and sales of U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in banks\u2019 reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nOur deposit insurance premiums could be substantially higher in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our future earnings.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, up to $250,000 per insured depositor category. The amount of a particular institution\u2019s deposit insurance assessment is based on that institution\u2019s risk classification under an FDIC risk-based\nassessment system. An institution\u2019s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to its regulators. As a result of recent FDIC assessment charges, banks are now assessed deposit insurance premiums based on the bank\u2019s average consolidated total assets less the sum of its average tangible equity, and the FDIC has modified certain risk-based adjustments, which increase or decrease a bank\u2019s overall assessment rate. In addition to ordinary assessments described above, the FDIC has the ability to impose special assessments in certain instances. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures, we may be required to pay higher FDIC premiums than the recent levels. Any future additional assessments, increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums could reduce our profitability, may limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities or otherwise negatively impact our operations.\nLegal, Accounting, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nWe face a risk of noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations and corresponding enforcement proceedings.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, the PATRIOT Act, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among our other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and to file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury Department to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Federal and state bank regulators also focus on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nWe may be materially and adversely affected by the highly regulated environment in which we operate.\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state regulation, supervision and examination. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, FDIC funds, customers and the banking system as a whole, rather than our stockholders. Compliance with banking regulations is costly and these regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, mergers and acquisitions, dividend policy, and growth, among other things.\nThe Company and the Bank also undergo periodic examinations by their regulators, who have extensive discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or policies could also result in heightened regulatory scrutiny and in sanctions by regulatory agencies (such as a memorandum of understanding, a written supervisory agreement or a cease and desist order), civil money penalties and/or reputation damage. Any of these consequences could restrict our ability to expand our business or could require us to raise additional capital or sell assets on terms that are not advantageous to us or our stockholders and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA more detailed description of the primary federal banking laws and regulations that affect the Company and the Bank is included in this Form 10-K under the section captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in Item 1. Since the 2008 financial crisis, federal and state banking laws and regulations, as well as interpretations and implementations of these laws and regulations, have undergone substantial review and change. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act drastically revised the laws and regulations under which we operate. The burden of regulatory compliance has increased under the Dodd-Frank Act and has increased our costs of doing business and, as a result, may create an advantage for our competitors who may not be subject to similar legislative and regulatory requirements.\nWe face risks related to the adoption of future legislation and potential changes in federal regulatory agency leadership, policies, and priorities.\nWith a new Congress taking office in January 2021, Democrats have retained control of the U.S. House of Representatives, and have gained control of the U.S. Senate, albeit with a majority found only in the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Harris. However slim the majorities, though, the net result is unified Democratic control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, and consequently Democrats will be able to set the agenda both legislatively and in the Administration. We expect that Democratic-led Congressional committees will pursue greater oversight and will also pay increased attention to the banking sector\u2019s role in providing COVID-19-related assistance. The prospects for the enactment of major banking reform legislation under the new Congress are unclear at this time.\nMoreover, the turnover of the presidential administration has produced, and likely will continue to produce, certain changes in the leadership and senior staffs of the federal banking agencies, the CFPB, SEC, and the Treasury Department. These changes could impact the rulemaking, supervision, examination and enforcement priorities and policies of the agencies. Of note, promptly after taking office,\nPresident Biden issued an Executive Order instituting a \u201cfreeze\u201d of certain recently-finalized and pending regulations to allow for review by incoming Administration officials. As a result of this Executive Order, recently-adopted regulations may be subject to further notice-and-comment rulemaking and, more broadly, agency rulemaking agendas may be disrupted. The potential impact of any changes in agency personnel, policies and priorities on the financial services sector, including the Bank, cannot be predicted at this time. Regulations and laws may be modified at any time, and new legislation may be enacted that will affect us. Any future changes in federal and state laws and regulations, as well as the interpretation and implementation of such laws and regulations, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including those listed above or other ways that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur accounting estimates and risk management processes and controls rely on analytical and forecasting techniques and models and assumptions, which may not accurately predict future events.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with GAAP and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner in which to report our financial condition and results. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet which may result in our reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nCertain accounting policies are critical to presenting our financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. These critical accounting policies include the allowance for credit losses and fair value methodologies. Because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters, we may be required to significantly increase the ACL or sustain loan losses that are significantly higher than the reserve provided, reduce the carrying value of an asset measured at fair value, or significantly increase liabilities measured at fair value. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur internal controls, disclosure controls, processes and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures are based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable (not absolute) assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls, processes and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls, processes and procedures could necessitate changes in those controls, processes and procedures, which may increase our compliance costs, divert management attention from our business or subject us to regulatory actions and increased regulatory scrutiny. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAs a participating lender in the SBA Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), we are subject to additional risks of litigation from our customers or other parties regarding our processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties.\nOn March 27, 2020, President Trump signed the CARES Act, which created a guaranteed, unsecured loan program, the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, to fund operational costs of eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons during COVID-19. Under the PPP, small businesses and other entities and individuals can apply for loans from existing SBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enroll in the program, subject to numerous limitations and eligibility criteria. The Bank is participating as a lender in the PPP. The PPP commenced on April 3, 2020, and was available to qualified borrowers through August 8, 2020, and an additional stimulus package was approved on December 28, 2020, authorizing an additional $284.5 billion of PPP funds. Since the opening of the PPP, several other larger banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the PPP. We may be exposed to the risk of litigation, from both customers and non-customers that approached us regarding PPP loans, regarding our process and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP. If any such litigation is filed against us and is not resolved in a manner favorable to us, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect our reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP-related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also have credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by us, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by us, the SBA may deny our liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from us.\nWe are subject to federal and state fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nFederal and state fair lending laws and regulations, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice, the CFPB and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s\nperformance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. A successful challenge to our performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact our rating under the Community Reinvestment Act and result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax laws, regulations, and interpretations or challenges to our income tax provision.\nWe compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any change in enacted tax laws, rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations, or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments and results of operations. The taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our tax positions, which could increase our effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. We are subject to audit and review by U.S. federal and state tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nIn addition, deferred tax assets are reported as assets on our balance sheet and represent the decrease in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and tax credit carryforwards and because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by enacted tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements. As of December 31, 2020, we had net deferred tax assets of $8.1 million, which included no remaining federal net operating loss carryforward. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income during the periods in which existing deferred tax assets are expected to become deductible for income tax purposes. Changes in enacted tax laws, such as adoption of a lower income tax rate in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, could impact our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets. Our deferred tax asset may be further reduced in the future if estimates of future income or our tax planning strategies do not support the amount of the deferred tax asset. Charges to establish a valuation allowance with respect to our deferred tax asset could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the determination of our provision for income taxes and other liabilities requires significant judgment by management. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nWe could become subject to claims and litigation pertaining to our fiduciary responsibility.\nSome of the services we provide, such as wealth management services through River Street Advisors, LLC, require us to act as fiduciaries for our customers and others. Customers make claims and on occasion take legal action pertaining to our performance of our fiduciary responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal action related to our performance of our fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal action are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Any financial liability or reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are defendants in a variety of litigation and other actions.\nCurrently, there are certain other legal proceedings pending against the Company and our subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of any legal proceeding is inherently uncertain, based on information currently available, the Company\u2019s management believes that any liabilities arising from pending legal matters would not have a material adverse effect on us or our consolidated financial statements. However, if actual results differ from management\u2019s expectations, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nFrom time to time we are, or may become, involved in suits, legal proceedings, information-gatherings, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences.\nMany aspects of the banking business involve a substantial risk of legal liability. From time to time, we are, or may become, the subject of information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings, and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank regulatory agencies, self-regulatory agencies, the SEC and law enforcement authorities. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgements, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way we conduct our business or reputational harm.\nCapital and Liquidity Risks\nOur business needs and future growth may require us to raise additional capital, but that capital may not be available or may be dilutive.\nWe may need to raise additional capital, in the form of debt or equity securities, in the future to have sufficient capital resources to meet our commitments and fund our business needs and future growth, particularly if the quality of our assets or earnings were to deteriorate significantly. In addition, the Company and the Bank are each required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support their operations.\nOur ability to raise capital will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets, which are outside of our control, and our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that such capital will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Any occurrence that limits our access to capital, may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. Further, if we need to raise capital in the future we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would then have to compete with those institutions for investors. Any inability to raise capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could be dilutive to both tangible book value and our share price.\nIn addition, an inability to raise capital when needed may subject us to increased regulatory supervision and the imposition of restrictions on our growth and business. These restrictions could negatively affect our ability to operate or further expand our operations through loan growth, acquisitions or the establishment of additional branches. These restrictions may also result in increases in operating expenses and reductions in revenues that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and share price.\nWe could experience an unexpected inability to obtain needed liquidity.\nLiquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due. The liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan requests, to accommodate possible outflows in deposits, and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities and is essential to a financial institution\u2019s business. The ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of its balance sheet structure, its ability to liquidate assets and its access to alternative sources of funds. We seek to ensure that our funding needs are met by maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity through asset and liability management. In 2020, the Bank experienced ample liquidity due to customer deposits received related to federal stimulus programs responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as funds received as PPP loans were forgiven, and short-term borrowing facilities were not required to be significantly utilized. However, if funds were needed, we could seek to secure liquidity under the advance program provided under terms offered by the FHLBC. If we are unable to obtain funds when needed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to maintain a strong core deposit base or access other low-cost funding sources.\nWe rely on bank deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding. In addition, our future growth will largely depend on our ability to maintain and grow a strong deposit base. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain core deposits, to obtain third party financing on favorable terms, or to have access to interbank or other liquidity sources, we may not be able to grow our assets as quickly. We compete with banks and other financial services companies for deposits. If our competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits in response to interest rate changes initiated by the FRBC Open Market Committee or for other reasons of their choice, our funding costs may increase, either because we raise our rates to avoid losing deposits or because we lose deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. Higher funding costs could reduce our net interest margin and net interest income. Any decline in available funding could adversely affect our ability to continue to implement our business strategy which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock\nOur future ability to pay dividends is subject to restrictions.\nWe currently conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries, and a significant part of our income is attributable to dividends from the Bank. We principally rely on the profitability of the Bank to conduct operations and satisfy obligations. As is the case with all financial institutions, the profitability of the Bank is subject to the fluctuating cost and availability of money, changes in interest rates, and in economic conditions in general.\nHolders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such cash dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Any declaration and payment of dividends on common stock will depend upon our earnings and financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, the general economic and regulatory climate, our ability to service any equity or debt obligations senior to the common stock, and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors. Furthermore, consistent with our business plans, growth initiatives, capital availability, projected liquidity needs, and other factors, we have made, and will continue to make, capital management decisions and policies that could adversely impact the amount of dividends, if any, paid to our stockholders.\nAlthough we currently expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends, any future determination relating to our dividend policy will be made by our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors. We are subject to certain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends as a result of banking laws, regulations and policies. Finally, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders depends on our receipt of dividends from the Bank, which is also subject to restrictions on dividends as a result of banking laws, regulations and policies. See Part II, Item 5. \u201cDividends.\u201d\nThe trading volumes in our common stock may not provide adequate liquidity for investors.\nShares of our common stock are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market; however, the average daily trading volume in our common stock is less than that of larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of a sufficient number of willing buyers and sellers of the common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the current daily average trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock in a brief period of time, or the expectation of these sales, could cause a significant decline in the price of our common stock.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be subject to continued significant fluctuations and volatility.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to, among other things:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating and financial results, particularly if such results vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors, including with respect to further credit losses on loans or unfunded commitments we may incur;\n\u25cf announcements regarding significant transactions in which we may engage;\n\u25cf market assessments regarding such transactions;\n\u25cf changes or perceived changes in our operations or business prospects;\n\u25cf legislative or regulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our businesses and operations;\n\u25cf a weakening of general market and economic conditions, particularly with respect to economic conditions in Illinois;\n\u25cf the operating and share price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;\n\u25cf future offerings by us of debt, preferred stock or trust preferred securities, each of which would be senior to our common stock upon liquidation and for purposes of dividend distributions;\n\u25cf actions of our current stockholders, including future sales of common stock by existing stockholders and our directors and executive officers; and\n\u25cf other changes in U.S. or global financial markets, economies and market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations or volatility.\nAs a result, the market price of our common stock may continue to be subject to similar market fluctuations that may or may not be related to our operating performance or prospects. Increased volatility could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nShares of our common stock are subject to dilution, which could cause our common stock price to decline.\nWe are generally not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock up to the number of shares authorized in our Certificate of Incorporation. We may issue additional shares of our common stock (or securities convertible into common stock) in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy (including mergers and acquisitions), to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, to address regulatory capital concerns, or to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding stock awards. We may issue equity securities in transactions that generate cash proceeds, transactions that free up regulatory capital but do not immediately generate or preserve substantial amounts of cash, and transactions that generate regulatory or balance sheet capital only and do not generate or preserve cash. If we choose to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock for any reason, the issuance would have a dilutive effect on the holders of our common stock and could have a material negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nCertain banking laws and our governing documents may have an anti-takeover effect and may make it difficult and expensive to remove current management.\nCertain federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our stockholders. In addition, certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the Company, even if such event was perceived by you to be beneficial to your interests. These include, among others, (a) provisions that empower our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock, the terms of which, including voting power, are set by the board of directors, (b) we have a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board, and (c) the approval of certain business combinations require the affirmative vote of at least 75% of our outstanding shares of common stock. The combination of these laws and provisions in our certificate of incorporation may inhibit certain business combinations, including a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. These provisions in our certificate of incorporation could also discourage proxy contests\nand make it more difficult and expensive for holders of our common stock to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board of directors or otherwise remove existing directors and management, even if current management is not performing adequately.", "PERMNO": 79851, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "OSBC"}
