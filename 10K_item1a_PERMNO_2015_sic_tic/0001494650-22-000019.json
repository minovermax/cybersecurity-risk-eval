RISK FACTORS\nRisk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding to invest in our common stock, you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with general economic and business risks and all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and the section titled \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be harmed. In that event, the price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks described below. See \"Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Resources\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses in the future.\nWe are a specialty pharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. To date, we have focused primarily on XHANCE and Onzetra Xsail, as well as other product candidates using our proprietary EDS device technology. Since inception, we have incurred significant net losses and expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. To date, we have generated revenue from sales of XHANCE since its launch in 2018, as well as from licensing revenues. We incurred net losses of $82.3 million and $99.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $610.1 million.\nWe expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we:\n\u25aacontinue to commercialize XHANCE and further scale up external manufacturing and distribution capabilities to commercialize XHANCE or any other product candidate for which we may obtain regulatory approval;\n\u25aacontinue to focus our regulatory compliance efforts on requirements applicable to marketed drugs;\n\u25aacontinue clinical development activities for XHANCE, including the one ongoing FDA Phase 3b clinical trial in pursuit of a follow-on indication for the treatment of chronic sinusitis and mandated post-marketing pediatric study;\n\u25aacontinue pre-clinical and clinical development activities with respect to our other product candidates;\n\u25aaseek to discover and develop, in-license or acquire additional products, product candidates and technology;\n\u25aamaintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u25aahire additional personnel to continue to support company growth; and\n\u25aaincur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a publicly traded commercial-stage company.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with drug development and commercialization, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. If we are required by regulatory authorities to perform studies in addition to those expected, or if there are any delays in the initiation and completion of our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates, our expenses could increase.\nWe may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nOur ability to become and remain profitable will depend on our ability to generate revenue. Our ability to generate revenue depends upon our ability to successfully commercialize XHANCE and any of our other product candidates, if approved, that we may in-license or acquire in the future, as well as from our ability to successfully out-license any of our products or technology. Our ability to generate revenue from our current or future products and product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25aaour ability to successfully commercialize XHANCE for the treatment of nasal polyps;\n\u25aaour ability to successfully complete required clinical trials and submit a supplemental NDA to the FDA and obtain regulatory approval for XHANCE for the treatment of chronic sinusitis;\n\u25aaour ability to complete and submit applications to, and obtain regulatory approval from, foreign regulatory authorities, if we choose to commercialize XHANCE outside the U.S.;\n\u25aathe size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval;\n\u25aathe performance of our sales team, in marketing and promoting XHANCE;\n\u25aaour ability to maintain and further develop a commercial organization capable of sales, marketing and distribution for XHANCE and any of our other product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval;\n\u25aaour ability to maintain commercially reasonable agreements with wholesalers, distributors and other third parties in our supply chain;\n\u25aaour success in establishing a commercially viable price for our products;\n\u25aaour success in defending against potential generic competition and other developments in our market generally;\n\u25aaour ability to have commercial quantities of our products manufactured at acceptable cost levels;\n\u25aaour ability to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third parties, including government payors; and\n\u25aaour ability to successfully complete development activities, including the necessary clinical trials, with respect to our other product candidates.\nXHANCE, as well as any of our other product candidates if approved for commercial sale, may not gain market acceptance or achieve commercial success. If our addressable market is not as significant as we estimate or the treatment population is narrowed by competition, physician choice or clinical practice guidelines, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of XHANCE. In addition, we would anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product. We may not achieve profitability. If we are unable to generate enough product revenues to cover our operating expenses and service our debt, we will not become profitable and may be unable to continue operations without continued funding.\nEven if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our development efforts, obtain drug approvals, diversify our offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nWe will likely require additional capital to fund our operations and, if we fail to obtain necessary financing, we may be unable to continue the commercialization of XHANCE and to continue the development of XHANCE for the treatment of chronic sinusitis.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale and issuance of common and preferred stock, debt, licensing revenues, XHANCE revenue and research grants. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to commercialize XHANCE and to advance the clinical development of XHANCE for the treatment of chronic sinusitis. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $110.5 million. Although it is difficult to predict our future liquidity requirements, we will likely require additional capital in the future secured through equity or debt financings, partnerships, collaborations, or other sources in order to meet our debt service obligations under our debt, and to carry out our planned development and commercial activities.\nOur future funding requirements, both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25aathe success of our commercialization of XHANCE for the treatment of nasal polyps including, among other things, patient and physician acceptance of XHANCE and our ability to maintain adequate insurance coverage and reimbursement for XHANCE;\n\u25aathe impact of COVID-19 on our sales of XHANCE and our clinical trials;\n\u25aathe cost of commercialization activities for XHANCE, including product manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sales;\n\u25aanet product revenues received from sales of XHANCE;\n\u25aathe level of co-pay assistance and other patient affordability programs offered for XHANCE;\n\u25aaour clinical development plans for XHANCE, including clinical trials for the supplemental indication for the treatment of chronic sinusitis and the FDA-mandated post-marketing pediatric study;\n\u25aathe outcome, timing and cost of the regulatory approval process of XHANCE for chronic sinusitis by the FDA, including the potential for the FDA to require that we perform more studies and clinical trials than those that we currently expect;\n\u25aathe costs involved in preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, and maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights;\n\u25aathe cost of defending intellectual property disputes, including patent infringement actions brought by third parties against us;\n\u25aathe initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials and other research and development related to additional product candidates; and\n\u25aathe extent to which we in-license, acquire or otherwise partner in the development of other products, product candidates or technologies.\nWe cannot be certain that additional funding will be available when needed on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts, when required or on acceptable terms, we also could be required to:\n\u25aaseek strategic collaborations to assist in the commercialization of XHANCE in the U.S. and other markets at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available;\n\u25aasignificantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development of XHANCE for the treatment of chronic sinusitis;\n\u25aarelinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to our EDS devices and technologies or other product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves;\n\u25aadelay, limit, reduce or terminate the drug development of our current or future product candidates, or seek collaborators for one or more of our current or future product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; or\n\u25aasignificantly curtail our operations.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants or other terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in a default under the Note Purchase Agreement that could materially and adversely affect the ongoing viability of our business.\nIn November 2021, we entered into a second amendment (the Second Amendment) to that certain Note Purchase Agreement, dated September 12, 2019, among us and our subsidiaries, OptiNose US, Inc., OptiNose UK Limited and OptiNose AS, BioPharma Credit PLC, as collateral agent, and the purchasers party thereto from time to time (Purchasers), as previously amended pursuant to that certain letter agreement dated August 13, 2020 and that certain first amendment to Note Purchase Agreement dated March 2, 2021 (as amended, the Note Purchase Agreement). As of December 31, 2021, $130.0 million of senior secured notes (the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes) have been issued under the Note Purchase Agreement. We are not eligible to issue any additional Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes under the Note Purchase Agreement. Amounts outstanding under the Note Purchase Agreement bear interest at a fixed rate of 10.75% per annum and are scheduled to mature on September 12, 2024 (the Maturity Date). As of December 31, 2021, the principal interest outstanding under the Note Purchase Agreement was $0.6 million.\nWe are required to make quarterly interest payments until the Maturity Date. We are also required to make principal payments, which are payable in five equal quarterly installments beginning on September 15, 2023, and continuing until the Maturity Date; provided that we may elect to postpone any such principal payment until the Maturity Date if, as of the applicable payment date, certain minimum trailing four-quarter consolidated XHANCE net sales and royalties thresholds have been achieved. The Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed by OptiNose, Inc. and our subsidiaries and are secured by a pledge of substantially all of our and their assets.\nThe Note Purchase Agreement contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions without our lenders\u2019 prior consent, as well as financial covenants that require us to maintain at least $30.0 million of cash and cash equivalents in certain deposit accounts and require us to achieve certain minimum trailing twelve-month consolidated XHANCE net sales and royalties, tested on a quarterly basis. Pursuant to the second amendment, the financial covenant to achieve minimum trailing twelve-month consolidated XHANCE net product sales and royalties under the Note Purchase Agreement are as follows (amounts in millions):\nEach holder of the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes may elect to accelerate the repayment of all unpaid principal and accrued interest under such holders\u2019 Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes upon consummation of a specified change of control transaction or occurrence of certain events of default (as specified in the Note Purchase Agreement), including, among other things:\n\u25aaour default in a payment obligation under the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes;\n\u25aaour breach of a financial covenant (including the financial covenants that require us to maintain at least $30.0 million of cash and cash equivalents in certain deposit accounts and require us to achieve certain minimum trailing twelve-month consolidated XHANCE net sales and royalties, tested on a quarterly basis), the restrictive covenants or other terms of the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes;\n\u25aaour breach of reporting obligations;\n\u25aaour failure to properly maintain the collateral;\n\u25aaany circumstance that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) on us;\n\u25aacertain regulatory and/or commercial actions that cause an ongoing delay in commercialization of XHANCE; and\n\u25aacertain specified insolvency and bankruptcy-related events.\nSubject to any applicable cure period set forth in the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes, all amounts outstanding with respect to the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes (principal and accrued interest), as well as any applicable prepayment premiums or interest \u201cmake-whole\u201d payments, would become due and payable immediately upon an event of default at a default interest rate of 13.75%. Our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay our obligations under the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes if the obligations thereunder are accelerated upon any events of default. The duration and magnitude of the negative impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on XHANCE net revenues has previously affected, and could affect in the future, our ability to meet the consolidated XHANCE net product sales and royalties threshold to remain in compliance with our financial covenants. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our obligations under the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes, the holders of such Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes could proceed to protect and enforce their rights under the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes by exercising such remedies (including foreclosure on the assets securing our obligations under the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes and the Note Purchase Agreement) as are available to the holders thereunder and in respect thereof under applicable law, either by suit in equity or by action at law, or both, whether for specific performance of any covenant or other agreement contained in the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in the Pharmakon Senior Secured Notes. Any such action would materially and adversely affect the ongoing viability of our business.\nOur Note Purchase Agreement contains restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe Note Purchase Agreement contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions without our lenders\u2019 prior consent. These covenants limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022 sell, transfer, lease or dispose of our assets;\n\u2022 create, incur or assume additional indebtedness;\n\u2022 encumber or permit liens on certain of our assets;\n\u2022 make restricted payments, including paying dividends on, repurchasing or making distributions with respect to our common stock;\n\u2022 make specified investments (including loans and advances);\n\u2022 consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022 enter into certain transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022 grant certain license rights related to our products, technology and other intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022 permit our cash and cash equivalents held in certain deposit accounts to be less than $30.0 million at any time.\nThe covenants in our Note Purchase Agreement and related security agreements may limit our ability to take certain actions that may be in our long-term best interests. In the event that we breach one or more covenants, our lenders may choose to declare an event of default and require that we immediately repay all amounts outstanding under the Notes, plus penalties and interest, terminate their commitments to purchase additional Notes and foreclose on the collateral granted to them to secure the Notes. Such repayment could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nProvisions of the Notes for certain potential payments to the holders of such Notes could impede a sale of the Company.\nSubject to certain exceptions, we are required to make mandatory prepayments of the Notes, with the proceeds of asset sales, extraordinary receipts and prohibited debt issuances, and upon the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement). In addition, we may make voluntary prepayments of the Notes, in whole or in part. All mandatory and voluntary prepayments of the Notes are subject to the payment of prepayment premiums as follows: (i) if prepayment occurs prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date, an amount equal to 2% of the principal prepaid, (ii) if prepayment occurs on or after the third anniversary of the Closing Date but prior to the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, an amount equal to 1% of the principal prepaid, and (iii) if prepayment occurs on or after the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, no prepayment premium is due. We are also required to pay a \"make-whole\" amount in respect of any principal prepayments (whether mandatory or voluntary) made prior to the 30-month anniversary of our November 2021 underwritten public offering, in an amount equal to the interest that would have accrued through the 30-month anniversary in respect of such Note but for such principal prepayment, provided that in the case of any prepayment made prior to the 15-month anniversary, we will not be required to pay a \u201cmake-whole\u201d amount in excess of an amount equal to the interest that would have accrued through the 15-month anniversary but for such principal prepayment. These provisions may make it more costly for a potential acquirer to engage in a business combination transaction with us. Provisions that have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nWe do not have any committed external source of funds. Until such a time, if ever, that we can generate substantial revenue, we may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. Debt financings may be coupled with an equity component, such as warrants to purchase shares, which could also result in dilution of our existing stockholders' ownership. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business and may result in liens being placed on our assets and intellectual property. If we were to default on such indebtedness, we could lose such assets and intellectual property.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations, or strategic alliance, grants, marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, product candidates or future revenue streams or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us or at an earlier stage than would otherwise be desirable.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards and other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had U.S. federal net operating loss (NOL) carry forwards of approximately $294.1 million available to offset future U.S. taxable income and U.S. federal research and development (R&D) tax credits of $2.4 million. While some of our federal NOL carry forwards will carry forward indefinitely, some of our U.S. NOL and credit carry forwards will expire if not utilized with the first expiration occurring in 2030. We also had state NOL\ncarry forwards of $231.8 million as of December 31, 2021. These state NOL carry forwards can only offset income in the same state in which they were generated and thus there is a possibility that they may not be utilized. The carry forward period varies among the states, with the first expiration in 2028. In addition, our Norwegian and UK subsidiaries had total foreign NOL carry forwards of $63.9 million as of December 31, 2021. These foreign NOL carry forwards do not expire but can only be used to offset profits generated in Norway or the United Kingdom, respectively, and may be limited in use based on the laws of those countries.\nOur U.S. NOL and tax credit carry forwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities because of their limited duration or because of other restrictions under U.S. tax law. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d, generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in equity ownership during a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to offset pre-change tax attributes, such as NOLs and R&D tax credits, against post-change income or tax may be limited. We have not performed an analysis under Section 382 of the Code and cannot predict or otherwise determine whether utilization of our federal tax attribute carry forwards may be limited. As a result, if we have taxable income in the future, our ability to use existing U.S. NOL and R&D tax credit carry forwards to reduce U.S. taxable income or tax liability may be subject to limitation resulting in increased future tax liabilities. Similar rules at the state level may also limit our ability to use state NOLs. Also, there may be periods when the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited at the state level, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. Furthermore, the losses could expire before we generate sufficient income to utilize them.\nWe may have ownership changes in the future due to additional changes in our stock ownership which could be outside of our control. If an ownership change occurs and our ability to use our historical net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards is limited, it could adversely impact our future operating results by increasing our tax obligations.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, as a pandemic (the \u201cCOVID-19 pandemic\u201d), which continues to spread throughout the U.S. and worldwide. On March 13, 2020, the then-President of the United States announced a national emergency relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn March 2020, we modified our business practices and transitioned to a full-time, virtual work environment in which all employees were encouraged to work from their place of residence if their job functions allowed, and all work-related travel was temporarily discontinued. A significant portion of the physicians' offices in which our territory managers detail XHANCE either were closed, had reduced patient flow or temporarily stopped sales representatives\u2019 visits, which has hindered our ability to detail XHANCE to physicians' offices. Late in the first quarter of 2020, we began to observe an adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on XHANCE prescription growth and net revenues, and we subsequently withdrew our previous XHANCE revenue guidance for 2020. This adverse impact on our revenues was most pronounced during the \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d mitigation efforts that were prevalent from late-March through May 2020. Where permitted by governmental requirements and the policies of physician offices, our territory managers began to return to in-person detailing of physicians in May and June 2020, however, many restrictions remain and some physicians' offices are still not accepting visits from sales representatives and others are limiting or placing restrictions on visits, which has negatively impacted our ability to drive prescription growth from the physicians targeted by our sales representatives. If our territory managers continue to have a limited ability to meet in person with physicians and if patients\u2019 visits to doctors continue to be limited, XHANCE prescription growth and net revenues will continue to be adversely impacted. In addition, reduced patients visiting physicians offices, changes in insurance coverage or reimbursement levels by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors, or in the type of such coverage held by patients, due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impact on U.S. unemployment rates, may also negatively impact XHANCE prescription growth and net revenues.\nThe duration and magnitude of the negative impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on consolidated XHANCE net revenues could also affect our ability to remain in compliance with our financial covenants. Furthermore, capital markets in the U.S. and around the world have also been negatively impacted by COVID-19; if market conditions continue to be volatile, it may harm our business, including our ability to obtain future financing.\nOur ability to enroll patients and retain principal investigators and site staff for our ongoing clinical trials have been, and could continue to be, impaired due to the COVID-19 outbreak in their geographic areas, the prioritization of medical resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic, or as a result of quarantines and other restrictions that interrupt healthcare services. For example, previous guidance related to the expected timing of results from our ongoing chronic sinusitis trials indicated that top-line results from both trials would be available in the second half of 2021. Pauses or delays in patient enrollment due to factors related to COVID-19 have had, and may continue to have, varying effects in different geographies and over time have led to a change in our projected timeline for initial data availability and may lead to additional changes in the future. We now expect top-line from our second ongoing Phase 3b chronic sinusitis trials in the second quarter of 2022. For those subjects currently participating in these studies, procedures to facilitate ongoing treatment and capture of data during periods of in-person care restrictions have been put in place. Furthermore, patients, investigators, or site staff have been and may continue to be unwilling or unable to comply with clinical trial protocols due to COVID-19 illness, concerns about the pandemic, or quarantines or other restrictions that impede their movement. Any interruption in the supply of the study drug might also delay our ability to complete our ongoing clinical trials within our expected timelines. Significant delays in the completion of our ongoing clinical trials are costly and could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nCOVID-19 may also have an adverse impact on our contract manufacturers, suppliers, PPN partners, wholesalers, distributors and third party logistic provider as a result of employees or other key personnel becoming infected, preventive and precautionary measures that governments or such third parties are taking, such as social distancing, quarantines, and other restrictions, and shortages of supplies necessary for the manufacture of XHANCE. Any of these circumstances could adversely impact the ability of third parties on which we rely to manufacture and distribute adequate volumes of XHANCE. For example, in April 2020, our contract manufacturer for the formulation and assembly of finished XHANCE drug product implemented a reduced work schedule in response to the pandemic which resulted in temporary delays relating to the assembly of XHANCE finished goods.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business, our customers, and the third parties on whom we rely, such as our contract manufacturers, suppliers, PPN partners, wholesalers, distributors, third party logistics, contract research organizations, investigators for our clinical trials and other vendors, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak and any resurgence, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus, the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, and the speed with which and the extent to which normal economic and operating conditions resume, among others.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of XHANCE\nWe have a limited history of commercializing drugs, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nAlthough our predecessor and subsidiary, OptiNose AS, commenced operations in 2000, our operations until the launch of XHANCE in March 2018 were largely focused on raising capital and developing Onzetra Xsail and XHANCE, including undertaking preclinical studies and conducting clinical trials. While we conducted the pre-approval stages of clinical development for Onzetra Xsail, Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was responsible for completing the clinical development of, obtaining regulatory approval for, and initiating the initial commercial launch of that product under our former license agreement with them. Further, while we have been commercializing XHANCE since March 2018, we have limited history regarding sales, marketing, distribution and other activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Consequently, any predictions about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer history of successfully developing and commercializing drugs.\nIf we are unable to successfully commercialize XHANCE, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the price of our common stock may decline.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize XHANCE depends on many factors, including:\n\u25aaour ability to have commercial quantities of XHANCE manufactured at a reasonable cost and with sufficient speed to meet commercial demand;\n\u25aathe ability of our sales team to effectively market, promote and sell XHANCE;\n\u25aaour success in educating physicians, patients and caregivers about the benefits, administration and use of XHANCE;\n\u25aapatient and physician acceptable of XHANCE;\n\u25aathe availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of competing products;\n\u25aathe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement for XHANCE;\n\u25aaour ability to commercialize XHANCE at a profitable average net revenue per prescription;\n\u25aaour ability to obtain and maintain contracts with wholesalers, distributors and/or PPN partners on acceptable terms;\n\u25aaresults from additional clinical trials and our ability to obtain regulatory approval for XHANCE for a follow-on indication for the treatment of chronic sinusitis;\n\u25aathe effectiveness of our marketing campaigns;\n\u25aaour ability to attract and retain qualified pharmaceutical industry personnel;\n\u25aaa continued acceptable safety profile for XHANCE;\n\u25aaour ability to obtain and maintain required state licenses to sell XHANCE; and\n\u25aaour ability to successfully defend any challenges to our intellectual property relating to XHANCE.\nIt is difficult for us to predict future performance. As we gain additional commercial experience, a number of factors over which we have limited control may contribute to fluctuations in our financial results. We expect that first quarter prescription demand and average net revenue per prescription for XHANCE will be adversely impacted by the annual resetting of patient healthcare insurance plan deductibles and changes in individual patients' healthcare insurance coverage, both of which often occur in January. Additionally, demand has historically been, and we expect will continue to be, impacted by the seasonal variation in patient visits with their doctor and INS market seasonality resulting in reduced XHANCE prescription demand in the third quarter.\nMany of these matters are beyond our control and are subject to other risks described elsewhere in this \"Risk Factors\" section. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully commercialize or generate enough revenue from XHANCE to achieve profitability. If we cannot do so, or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the price of our common stock may decline.\nThe commercial success of XHANCE depends upon its acceptance by multiple stakeholders, including physicians, patients and healthcare payors.\nThe degree of market acceptance of XHANCE depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u25aademonstration of clinical safety and efficacy;\n\u25aarelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u25aapricing and cost-effectiveness;\n\u25aaavailability of alternative treatments and perceived advantages over such alternative treatments;\n\u25aathe clinical indications for which XHANCE is approved;\n\u25aathe prevalence and severity of any AEs;\n\u25aalimitations or warnings contained in the FDA-approved label for XHANCE;\n\u25aathe effectiveness of our or any future collaborators' sales and marketing strategies;\n\u25aaconsolidation among healthcare providers, which increases the impact of the loss of any relationship;\n\u25aaour ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement;\n\u25aaadequacy and accessibility of our patient assistance programs; and\n\u25aathe willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage.\nIf XHANCE does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients and healthcare payors, we may not generate sufficient revenue in order to become or remain profitable.\nIf third-party payors do not reimburse patients for XHANCE or if reimbursement levels are set too low for us to sell XHANCE at a profit, our ability to successfully commercialize XHANCE and our results of operations will be harmed.\nOur ability to commercialize XHANCE successfully depends in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for XHANCE will be available in a timely manner and remains available from third-party payors, including governmental healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. Government authorities and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, determine which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. Reimbursement decisions by particular third-party payors depend upon a number of factors, including each third-party payor's determination that use of a product is:\n\u25aaa covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u25aaappropriate and medically necessary for the specific condition or disease;\n\u25aacost effective; and\n\u25aaneither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for XHANCE from government authorities or other third-party payors is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data, including expensive pharmacoeconomic studies beyond the data required to obtain marketing approval, for the use of XHANCE to each government authority or other third-party payor. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain or maintain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement from government authorities or other third-party payors.\nThird-party payors may deny reimbursement for covered products if they determine that a medical product was not used in accordance with cost-effective diagnosis methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an unapproved indication. Third-party payors also may refuse to reimburse for procedures and devices deemed to be experimental. Third-party payors may also limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication.\nThird-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Levels of reimbursement may also decrease in the future, and future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors may adversely affect the demand for and reimbursement available for XHANCE, which in turn, could negatively impact pricing. Further, payors, including healthcare insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and group purchasing organizations, increasingly seek ways to reduce their costs. Many payors continue to adopt benefit plan changes that shift a greater portion of prescription costs to patients. Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs, higher patient co-pay or co-insurance obligations and limitations on patients\u2019 use of commercial manufacturer co-pay assistance programs (including through co-pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs). Payors also increasingly seek price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage. Payors may also control costs by imposing restrictions on access to or usage of our products, such as by requiring prior authorizations or \"step-edits,\" and may choose to exclude certain indications for which our products are approved or even choose to exclude coverage entirely. For example, some insurers have established a step-edit system that requires a patient to first use a lower price alternative product prior to becoming eligible for reimbursement of a higher priced product and some insurers require that a physician attest that XHANCE is being used to treat a patient for an indication for which XHANCE is approved. Approximately half of the commercially covered lives as of December 31, 2021 are in a plan that requires a prior authorization and most of those prior authorizations request information regarding patient diagnosis and prior use of INS. Some providers may not complete the burdensome administrative process required to demonstrate or document that the patients for whom XHANCE has been prescribed meet the payors\u2019 utilization management criteria (i.e., prior authorizations or step-edits) and, as a result, patients will not gain access to XHANCE treatment. Further, other patients may obtain coverage for XHANCE but abandon their prescriptions rather than pay their co-pay payment which would result in a significant shortfall in achieving our revenue expectations and negatively impact our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nSignificant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and pharmacy benefit managers exerting greater pressure in pricing and usage negotiations with drug manufacturers, significantly increasing discounts and rebates required of manufacturers and limiting patient access and usage. Further consolidation among insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and other payors, including through integrated delivery systems, would increase the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other drug manufacturers. Ultimately, further discounts, rebates, coverage or plan changes, restrictions or exclusions as described above could have a material adverse effect on sales of our affected products.\nIf we are unable to differentiate XHANCE from current and future products or existing methods of treatments, our ability to successfully commercialize XHANCE would be adversely affected.\nWe are currently commercializing XHANCE for the treatment of nasal polyps and intend to seek FDA approval for a follow-on indication of XHANCE for the treatment of chronic sinusitis. Currently, Nasonex\u2122, marketed by Merck, is the only other branded drug therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of nasal polyps. A generic version of Nasonex\u2122, mometasone furoate monohydrate, was approved by the FDA for, among other indications, the treatment of nasal polyps and launched in 2016. In addition, Beconase AQ\u2122, which is an INS marketed by GlaxoSmithKline, is indicated for the prophylaxis of nasal polyps after surgical resection, while SINUVA\u2122 is a commercially available corticosteroid-eluting implant indicated for the treatment of nasal polyps in adult patients who have had ethmoid sinus surgery that can be placed in the ethmoid sinus under endoscopic visualization for up to 90 days. We are not aware of any drug product approved for the treatment of chronic sinusitis. In addition to competition from Nasonex\u2122 and Beconase AQ\u2122, we will also need to differentiate XHANCE from other products and treatments identified in current clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps. Such products and treatments include the use of nasal rinses, decongestants, over-the-counter and prescription INS products, oral steroids, antibiotics, and sinus surgery and other procedures, including functional endoscopic sinus surgery, balloon sinus dilation and steroid-releasing sinus implants. In addition, several monoclonal antibodies are in clinical development or have been developed for the treatment of nasal polyps. In June 2019, the FDA approved DUPIXENT\u2122 (dupilumab) as an add-on maintenance treatment (to an intranasal steroid) in adult patients with inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. In November 2020, the FDA approved XOLAIR\u2122 add-on maintenance treatment of nasal polyps in adult patients with inadequate response to nasal corticosteroids. In July 2021, the FDA approved NUCALA\u2122 add-on maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in adult patients with inadequate response to nasal corticosteroids. In addition, Lyra Therapeutics is developing corticosteroid-eluting implants as potential treatment for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. If we are unable to achieve significant differentiation for XHANCE against these other products and treatments, including on the basis of efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of administration, price and reimbursement, the opportunity for XHANCE to be commercialized successfully would be adversely affected.\nIf the market opportunities for XHANCE are smaller than we believe, our revenue may be adversely affected, and our business may suffer.\nWe believe there is a market opportunity for XHANCE consisting of ENT physicians, allergists and high-decile INS-prescribing primary care physicians that we believe treat an estimated 3.5 million U.S. patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, an estimated 1.2 million of whom have chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. If we are able to obtain a follow-on indication of XHANCE for the treatment of chronic sinusitis, we intend to broaden, through potential collaborations, our reach and target primary care physicians that we believe treat an additional estimated 6.25 million patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, an estimated one-third of whom have chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.\nOur projections of both the number of people who suffer from chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps, as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from the use of XHANCE, are based on our beliefs and estimates. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including scientific literature, surveys we commissioned, prescription data or other market research and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis or nasal polyps. The number of patients may turn out to be lower than expected. Additionally, the potentially addressable patient population for XHANCE may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with XHANCE, and new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business.\nClinical practice guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations could have significant influence on the use of XHANCE.\nGovernment agencies may promulgate clinical practice guidelines directly applicable to XHANCE. In addition, professional societies, practice management groups, private health and science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to the healthcare and patient communities. Recommendations of government agencies or these other groups or organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of concomitant therapies. Recommendations or guidelines suggesting the reduced use of XHANCE or the use of competitive or alternative products as the standard of care to be followed by patients and healthcare providers could result in decreased use of XHANCE.\nA significant portion of our sales are to a limited number of PPN partners and pharmaceutical wholesalers. Changes in terms required by these wholesalers, disruptions in these relationships or a default could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nApproximately 84% of our XHANCE net revenues during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 were to PPN partners. The three leading PPNs accounted for approximately 22% of our XHANCE net revenues. Additionally, approximately 16% of our XHANCE net revenues during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 were to the three largest wholesale pharmaceutical distributors, Cardinal Health, McKesson Corporation and AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation. If any of these PPN partners or wholesalers ceases to purchase our product for any reason, then unless and until the remaining PPN partners or wholesalers increase their purchases of XHANCE or alternative distribution channels are established:\n\u25aaour commercial operations could be significantly disrupted;\n\u25aathe availability of XHANCE to patients could be disrupted; and\n\u25aawe may not achieve the sales of XHANCE that we expect, which would decrease our revenues.\nWe do not require collateral from our wholesalers or PPN partners but rather maintain credit limits and, as a result, we have an exposure to credit risk in our accounts receivable. A default by a large PPN partner or wholesaler could harm our results of operations and financial condition. In the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2021, we established bad debt reserves for two customer with past due balances. Our inability to collect these past due balances or any other balances that may become past due as a result of our extension of credit to customers may harm our results of operations.\nWe rely on PPN partners for distribution of XHANCE in the U.S., and the failure of those PPN partners to distribute XHANCE effectively would adversely affect sales of XHANCE.\nOur reliance on PPN partners for the distribution of XHANCE in the U.S. involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that these PPN partners will:\n\u25aanot provide us accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, the number of patients who are using our products or complaints about our products;\n\u25aareduce or discontinue their efforts to sell or support or otherwise not effectively sell or support our products, including, without limitation, the discontinuation of their refill programs for XHANCE and other patient support services;\n\u25aanot devote the resources necessary to sell our products in the volumes and within the time frames that we expect;\n\u25aaengage in unlawful or inappropriate business practices that result in legal or regulatory enforcement activity which could result in liability to our Company or damage our goodwill with patients; or\n\u25aabe unable to satisfy financial obligations to us or others.\nIn the event that any of the PPN partners with whom we work do not fulfill their contractual obligations to us or refuse to or fail to adequately serve patients, or the agreements are terminated without adequate notice, shipments of XHANCE, and associated revenues, would be adversely affected.\nIf we cannot implement and maintain effective patient affordability programs or improve formulary access for XHANCE in the face of increasing pressure to reduce the price of medications, the adoption of XHANCE by physicians and patients may decline.\nWe offer patient affordability programs through traditional retail pharmacies and PPN partners to help reduce eligible patients\u2019 out-of-pocket costs for XHANCE prescriptions. The utilization of our patient affordability programs will depend on physician and patient awareness and acceptance of the programs. Additionally, certain co-pay assistance benefits are only available through PPN partners. As a result, eligible patients\u2019 out-of-pocket cost for XHANCE, when dispensed through PPN partners, may be lower than such costs when XHANCE is dispensed from traditional retail pharmacies. However, to the extent physicians are not willing to prescribe through PPN partners or patients are not willing to receive XHANCE through PPN partners, access to and utilization of XHANCE may decline. In addition, our patient affordability programs are not available to federal health care program (such as Medicare and Medicaid) beneficiaries.\nWe have also contracted with certain PBMs and other payors to secure formulary status and reimbursement for XHANCE, which generally require us to pay administrative fees and rebates to the PBMs and other payors for qualifying prescriptions. While we have agreements with three of the largest PBMs, as well as other PBMs and payors, in order to facilitate formulary status for XHANCE, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to agree to terms with other PBMs and payors, or that such terms will be commercially reasonable to us. Additionally, our contracts with PBMs and payors are of limited duration and PBMs and payors with whom we contract may seek to renegotiate more favorable terms prior to the expiration of such contracts or in connection with renewals. Despite our agreements with PBMs, the extent of formulary status and reimbursement will ultimately depend to a large extent upon individual healthcare plan formulary decisions. If healthcare plans that contract with PBMs with which we have agreements do not adopt formulary changes recommended by the PBMs with respect to XHANCE, we may not realize the expected access and reimbursement benefits from these agreements. Consequently, the success of our PBM contracting strategy will depend not only on our ability to expand formulary adoption among healthcare plans, but also upon the relative mix of healthcare plans that have PBM-chosen formularies versus custom formularies. If we are unable to realize the expected benefits of our contractual arrangements with the PBMs the adoption of XHANCE by physicians and patients may decline. If we are unable to increase adoption of PPN partners for filling prescriptions of XHANCE by physicians or to secure formulary status and reimbursement through arrangements with PBMs and other payors, particularly with healthcare plans that use custom formularies, our ability to achieve net sales growth for XHANCE would be impaired.\nThe negative publicity regarding specialty pharmacies or patient support service providers may result in physicians being less willing to send prescriptions to PPN partners or participate in our patient affordability programs, which would limit patient access and utilization of XHANCE.\nThere has been negative publicity and inquiries from Congress and enforcement authorities regarding the use of specialty pharmacies and patient support services providers and drug pricing. We contract with PPN partners (who may be considered specialty pharmacies) and patient support services providers that provide certain services in connection with our patient affordability programs. These programs are in place to assist in ensuring that when a physician determines XHANCE offers a potential clinical benefit to their patients and they prescribe it for an eligible patient, financial assistance may be available to reduce the patient\u2019s out-of-pocket costs. We do not own or possess any option to purchase an ownership stake in any pharmacy that distributes XHANCE or in any patient support services provider, and our relationship with each pharmacy and patient support services provider is non-exclusive and arm\u2019s length. All of our sales are processed through pharmacies independent of us. Despite this, the negative publicity and interest from Congress and enforcement authorities regarding specialty pharmacies or patient support services providers may result in physicians being less willing to send prescriptions to PPN partners or participate in our patient affordability programs and thereby limit patient access and utilization of XHANCE.\nWe may be unable to form and maintain relationships with pharmacies that participate in our PPN and patient affordability programs, which could adversely affect the commercialization of XHANCE and our operating results.\nWe may encounter difficulty in forming and maintaining relationships with pharmacies that participate in our PPN and patient affordability programs. We currently depend on a limited number of PPN partners to fulfill patient prescriptions. If these PPN partners are unable to process and fulfill the volume of patient prescriptions directed to them, our ability to maintain or increase prescriptions for XHANCE will be impaired. The commercialization of XHANCE and our operating results could be affected should any of the PPN partners choose not to continue to fulfill XHANCE prescriptions or by any adverse market events at any of the PPN partners. For example, pharmacies that dispense XHANCE could lose contracts that they currently maintain with managed care organizations (MCOs),\nincluding PBMs. Pharmacies often enter into agreements with MCOs. They may be required to abide by certain terms and conditions to maintain access to MCO networks, including terms and conditions that could limit their ability to participate in patient affordability programs like ours. Failure to comply with the terms of their agreements with MCOs could result in a variety of penalties, including termination of their agreement, which could negatively impact the ability of those pharmacies to dispense XHANCE and collect reimbursement from MCOs for such medicines.\nOur patient affordability programs are subject to certain federal and state laws, the violation of which could have an adverse impact on our business and subject us to significant penalties.\nOur patient affordability programs may implicate certain federal and state laws related to, among other things, unlawful schemes to defraud, fraud and abuse, excessive fees for services, tortious interference with patient contracts and statutory or common law fraud. We have a comprehensive compliance program in place to address adherence with various laws and regulations relating to the selling, marketing and manufacturing of XHANCE. Despite our compliance efforts, to the extent the patient affordability programs are found to be inconsistent with applicable laws or the pharmacies that participate in our patient affordability programs do not comply with applicable laws or our business rules, we may be required to restructure or discontinue such programs, terminate our relationship with certain pharmacies, or be subject to other significant penalties.\nIf the cost of maintaining our patient affordability programs increases relative to our sales revenue, we could be forced to reduce or eliminate our financial assistance programs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nIf the cost of maintaining our patient affordability programs increases relative to our sales revenues, we could be forced to reduce the amount of patient financial assistance that we offer or otherwise scale back or eliminate such programs, which could in turn have a negative impact on physicians\u2019 willingness to prescribe and patients\u2019 willingness to fill prescriptions of XHANCE. While we believe that our arrangements with PBMs will result in broader inclusion of XHANCE on healthcare plan formularies, and lower our cost of providing patient affordability programs, these arrangements generally require us to pay administrative and rebate payments to the PBMs and/or other payors and their effectiveness will ultimately depend to a large extent upon individual healthcare plan formulary decisions that are beyond the control of the PBMs. If our arrangements with PBMs and other payors do not result in increased prescriptions and reductions in our costs to provide our patient affordability programs that are sufficient to offset the administrative fees and rebate payments to the PBMs and/or other payors, our financial results may continue to be harmed.\nXHANCE may become associated with undesirable adverse reactions or have other properties that could result in significant negative consequences following regulatory approval.\nIf we or others identify AEs associated with XHANCE, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u25aawe may be forced to suspend marketing of XHANCE;\n\u25aathe FDA may withdraw its approval of XHANCE or impose restrictions on its distribution;\n\u25aathe FDA may require additional warnings or contradictions in the label that could diminish the usage or otherwise limit the commercial success of XHANCE;\n\u25aawe may be required to conduct additional post-marketing studies;\n\u25aawe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u25aaour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of XHANCE.\nIf the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities approve generic or similar products that compete with XHANCE, or if the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities change or create new pathways that may expedite approval of such products, it could decrease our expected sales of XHANCE.\nOnce an NDA, including a Section 505(b)(2) application, is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a \"listed drug\" which can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA. The FD&C Act, FDA regulations and other applicable regulations and policies provide incentives to manufacturers to create modified, non-infringing versions of a drug to facilitate the approval of an ANDA for generic\nsubstitutes. Manufacturers may be able to bring a generic product to market in a much more cost-efficient pathway than we currently anticipate. If the costs involved in bringing such a product to market are significantly less than our costs with respect to the development of XHANCE, companies that produce generic equivalents to XHANCE may be able to offer their products at lower prices. Further, if the timeline for bringing such a product to market is expedited, companies that produce generic equivalents to XHANCE may compete with XHANCE faster than we currently anticipate. For example, the FDA has communicated a priority to build on initiatives to accelerate generic entry of complex generics, which include locally acting nasal drug products and the FDA has included XHANCE on the updated list of product specific guidances for complex generic drug products that the FDA plans to issue, which may provide clarity for competitors to develop generic products that compete with XHANCE. If the FDA accepts alternatives to comparative clinical endpoint bioequivalence studies for generic versions of XHANCE, we may face generic competition faster than we currently anticipate and a significant percentage of any future sales of XHANCE could be lost to such generic products. In 2019, the FDA published a draft product-specific guidance for 0.05mg/spray fluticasone propionate nasal spray that states that a comparative clinical endpoint bioequivalence study is recommended for a fluticasone propionate nasal spray product because of an inability to adequately characterize drug particle size distribution (PSD) in aerosols and sprays using commonly used analytical methods. However, the draft guidance also provides that if a product's PSD can be accurately measured using a validated analytical method such as morphology-directed Raman spectroscopy or any other advanced methodology, the product's sponsor could submit comparative PSD data as part of their drug characterization within their ANDA application as a potential alternative to a bioequivalence study. Moreover, in addition to generic competition, we could face competition from other companies seeking approval of products that are similar to ours using the Section 505(b)(2) pathway. Such applicants may be able to rely on XHANCE or other approved drug products or published literature to develop drug products that are similar to ours. Furthermore, in 2021 we provided units of XHANCE to a generic manufacturer in compliance with the CREATES Act. The introduction of a drug product similar to our products or product candidates could expose us to increased competition, leading to a decrease in sales of XHANCE. Competition that we may face from generic or similar versions of XHANCE could materially and adversely impact our future revenue, profitability, and cash flows.\nEven though we have obtained regulatory approval for XHANCE, we still face extensive FDA regulatory requirements and may face future regulatory difficulties.\nEven though we have obtained regulatory approval in the U.S. for XHANCE for the treatment of nasal polyps in adults, the FDA and state regulatory authorities may still impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of XHANCE, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-marketing surveillance. For example, as part of its approval of XHANCE for the treatment of nasal polyps in adults, the FDA is requiring that we conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age with nasal polyposis to assess the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of XHANCE in this population. We have contracted with various clinical trial sites and begun patient enrollment in this trial. We are required to complete the trial by January 2022 and to submit a final report with respect to the trial by July 2022, however, due to enrollment rates, we have submitted a request to the FDA to extend these deadlines. If the FDA declines our request, we may be in violation of this requirement relating to the FDA's approval of our NDA for XHANCE.\nWe are also subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and reporting of safety and other post-marketing information. The holder of an approved NDA is obligated to monitor and report AEs and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA. The holder of an approved NDA must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA regulations and may be subject to other potentially applicable federal and state laws. The applicable regulations in countries outside the U.S. grant similar powers to the competent authorities and impose similar obligations on companies.\nIn addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to payment of substantial user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations and adherence to commitments made in the NDA. Since XHANCE is a combination product, we also need to comply with some of the FDA's manufacturing regulations for devices. In addition to cGMP, the FDA requires that our drug-device combination product comply with the Quality System Regulation (QSR), which sets forth the FDA's manufacturing quality standards for medical devices, and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. If we, or a regulatory authority, discover previously unknown problems with XHANCE, such as AEs, of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with a facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions relative to XHANCE or the manufacturing facility,\nincluding requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market, suspension of manufacturing, or other FDA action or other action by foreign regulatory authorities.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements following approval of XHANCE, a regulatory authority may:\n\u25aaissue a warning letter asserting that we or our manufacturing partners are in violation of the law;\n\u25aaseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u25aasuspend, modify or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u25aasuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u25aarefuse to approve a pending NDA or a pending application for marketing authorization or supplements to an NDA or to an application for marketing authorization submitted by us;\n\u25aaseize our product or product candidate; and/or\n\u25aarefuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.\nOur relationships with physicians, patients, payors and pharmacies in the U.S. are subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws could expose us to criminal, civil and administrative sanctions, reputational harm, and could harm our results of operations and financial conditions.\nOur current and future operations with respect to the commercialization and further development of XHANCE, including the commercialization of XHANCE by our co-promotion partner, as well as potential future development programs, are subject to various U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations. These laws impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, support and education programs and constrain our business and financial arrangements and relationships with third-party payors, healthcare professionals, pharmacies and others who may prescribe, recommend, purchase or provide XHANCE, and other parties through which we market, sell and distribute XHANCE. Finally, our current and future operations are subject to additional healthcare-related statutory and regulatory requirements and enforcement by foreign regulatory authorities in jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The laws are described in greater detail in the previous section under \"Business - Government Regulation - Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws,\" and include, but are not limited to:\n\u25aathe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibits persons or entities from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.\n\u25aathe federal civil False Claims Act (which can be enforced through \"qui tam,\" or whistleblower actions, by private citizens on behalf of the federal government) prohibits any person from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment of government funds or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government.\n\u25aathe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services by a healthcare benefit program, which includes both government and privately funded benefits programs; similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.\n\u2022numerous federal and state laws and regulations that address privacy and data security, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer\nprotection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act)), govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating relevant compliance efforts. Compliance with these laws is difficult, constantly evolving, time consuming, and requires a flexible privacy framework and substantial resources. Compliance efforts will likely be an increasing and substantial cost in the future. Federal regulators, state attorneys general, and plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys have been and will likely continue to be active in this space.\n\u25aaa majority of states whom have adopted laws and regulations analogous to federal laws, including state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including private insurers. Other states have adopted laws that, among other things, require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; and state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities. In addition, some states have laws requiring pharmaceutical sales representatives to be registered or licensed, and still others impose limits on co-pay assistance that pharmaceutical companies can offer to patients.\n\u2022the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments program, and its implementing regulations, requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children's Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to direct or indirect payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held in the company by physicians and their immediate family members.\nThe shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare or pharmaceutical company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices, including those of our co-promotion partner, do not comply with applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations or guidance. If our operations or those of our co-promotion partner with respect to their promotion of XHANCE are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional oversight and reporting requirements if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other settlement agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to the same criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our financial condition and divert resources and the attention of our management from operating our business.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize and further develop XHANCE and generate revenues which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, or other governmental pricing programs, we could be subject to additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, and other governmental pricing programs, and therefore we are obligated to pay certain specified rebates and report pricing information with respect to XHANCE. Pricing and rebate calculations vary across product and programs, are complex and are often subject to interpretation by us, governmental and regulatory agencies and the courts. We cannot assure you that our submissions will not be found by CMS to be incomplete or incorrect. Governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations, requirements or conditions of participation, some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid. The Medicaid rebate amount is computed each quarter based on our submission to CMS of our current AMP and Best Price for the quarter. If we become aware that our reporting for a prior quarter was incorrect, or has changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we are obligated to resubmit the corrected data for a period not to exceed twelve quarters from the quarter in which the data originally were due, and CMS may request or require restatements for earlier periods as well. Such restatements and recalculations increase our costs for complying with the laws and regulations governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Any corrections to our rebate calculations could result in an overage or underage in our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the nature of the correction. Price recalculations also may affect the ceiling price at which we are required to offer our products to certain covered entities, such as safety-net providers, under the Public Health Service's 340B Program and under other similar government pricing programs. These programs are described in greater detail in the previous section under \"Business - Government Regulation - Coverage and Reimbursement.\"\nOur failure to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and other governmental programs could negatively impact our financial results. The issuance of federal regulations and coverage expansion by various governmental agencies relating to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program has increased and will continue to increase our costs and the complexity of compliance, has been and will continue to be time-consuming to implement, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, particularly if CMS challenges the approach we take in our implementation of federal regulation.\nWe also are liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data. In addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B Program refunds, if we are found to have knowingly submitted false AMP or Best Price information to the government, we may be liable for significant civil monetary penalties. Our failure to submit monthly/quarterly AMP and Best Price data on a timely basis also could result in a significant civil monetary penalty per day for each day the information is late beyond the due date. Further, if we are found to have knowingly misclassified a drug (e.g., by knowingly classifying it as a generic drug for Medicaid Drug Rebate Program purposes, which are subject to lower rebates, instead of a single-source or innovator multiple-source drug), we could be subject to civil monetary penalties no greater than two times the difference between the rebates we should have paid and the rebates we actually paid, which penalties are in addition to the penalties discussed previously. Such failures also could be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which we participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. In the event that CMS terminates our rebate agreement, federal payments may not be available under Medicaid or Medicare Part B for XHANCE. If we are found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of our ASP, the Medicare statute provides for significant civil monetary penalties for each misrepresentation for each day in which the misrepresentation was applied.\nHRSA issued a final regulation regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities, which became effective on January 1, 2019. It is currently unclear how HRSA will apply its enforcement authority under the regulation. HRSA also has implemented a ceiling price reporting requirement related to the 340B Program under which we are required to report 340B ceiling prices to HRSA on a quarterly basis, and HRSA then publishes that information to covered entities. Moreover, under a final regulation effective January 13, 2021, HRSA newly established an administrative dispute resolution, or ADR, process for claims by covered entities that a manufacturer has engaged in overcharging, and by manufacturers that a covered entity violated the prohibitions against diversion or duplicate discounts. Such claims are to be resolved through an ADR panel of government officials rendering a decision that could be appealed only in federal court. An ADR proceeding could subject us to onerous procedural requirements and could result in additional liability. In addition, changes to legislation, regulations, or guidance could modify 340B Program compliance or expand discount liability.\nCivil monetary penalties can also be applied if we are found to have knowingly and intentionally charged 340B covered entities more than the statutorily mandated ceiling price. A covered entity or association representing covered entities can also bring claims against us through HRSA\u2019s 340B ADR process. HRSA could terminate our 340B program Pharmaceutical Pricing Agreement for good cause, which could cause our Medicaid National Drug Rebate Agreement to be terminated, rendering federal funds for our covered outpatient drugs unavailable under\nMedicaid and Medicare Part B. Finally, we note again that civil monetary penalties could apply if a manufacturer fails to provide discounts under the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program in the amount of 125 percent of the discount that was due.\nFederal law requires that a company must participate in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) pricing program to be eligible to have its products paid for with federal funds. As part of this program, we are obligated to make XHANCE available for procurement on an FSS contract under which we must comply with standard government terms and conditions and charge a price that is no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price (FCP) to four federal agencies (VA, U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) Public Health Service, and U.S. Coast Guard). The FCP is based on the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (Non-FAMP), which we calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. If we overcharge the government in connection with our FSS contract or Tricare Retail Pharmacy Agreement, whether due to a misstated FCP or otherwise, we are required to refund the difference to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in allegations against us under the U.S. civil False Claims Act and other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and responding to a government investigation or enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nRegulatory approval for any approved product is limited by the FDA to those specific indications and conditions for which clinical safety and efficacy have been demonstrated.\nOur promotional materials, statements and training methods must comply with applicable laws and regulations, including FDA's prohibition of the promotion of unapproved, or off-label, use. Physicians may use our products off-label, as the FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician's independent choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. As healthcare professionals frequently prescribe corticosteroids for the treatment of chronic nasal inflammatory diseases, such as chronic rhinosinusitis, doctors often prescribe XHANCE for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis and other chronic nasal inflammatory diseases, even though the FDA has granted approval of XHANCE only for the treatment of nasal polyps and we promote the use of XHANCE only for the treatment of nasal polyps. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials, statements or activities constitute promotion of an off-label use, we could be required to modify our promotional materials, statements or training methods or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, such as the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions or criminal penalties. We may also be subject to actions by other governmental entities or private parties, such as the U.S. civil False Claims Act, civil whistleblower or \"qui tam\" actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional materials or activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities. In that event, our reputation could be damaged and market adoption of XHANCE could be impaired.\nEven though we have obtained FDA approval for XHANCE in the U.S., we may never obtain approval for or successfully commercialize XHANCE outside of the U.S., which would limit our ability to realize its full market potential.\nIn order to market XHANCE outside of the U.S., we must obtain marketing authorizations and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding quality, safety and efficacy. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by foreign regulatory authorities, and regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional non-clinical studies or clinical trials, which could be costly and time consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of XHANCE in those countries. While our management team has experience in obtaining foreign regulatory approvals at other companies, we do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any foreign jurisdiction, and we, as a company, do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, or if regulatory approval in international markets is delayed, our target market for XHANCE will be reduced and we would not be able to realize the full market potential of XHANCE. Furthermore, in addition to the costs to commercialize XHANCE in international markets, the pricing of XHANCE outside of the U.S. at levels acceptable to patients, prescribing physicians or a foreign government payor may be a challenge. If we are unable to achieve, or do not believe we will be able to achieve, acceptable pricing, we may not be able to profitably commercialize XHANCE in international markets.\nThe Affordable Care Act and any other healthcare reform measures may increase the difficulty and cost for us to commercialize XHANCE and affect the prices we may obtain.\nThe U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions have proposed and enacted legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system that could restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell XHANCE. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs.\nThe Affordable Care Act was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. These intended reforms are described in greater detail in the previous section under \"Business - Government Regulation - U.S. Healthcare Reform.\"\nAmong the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that have been implemented since enactment and are of importance to the commercialization of XHANCE are the following:\n\u25aaan annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs or biologic agents;\n\u25aaan increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;\n\u25aaexpansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the U.S. civil False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;\n\u25aaa new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% (as of January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u25aaextension of manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u25aaprice reporting requirements for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected;\n\u25aaexpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs;\n\u25aaexpansion of the entity types eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service Act's 340B drug pricing program;\n\u25aaa requirement to annually report certain information regarding drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and\n\u25aaa Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.\nCertain provisions of the Affordable Care Act have been subject to judicial challenges, as well as efforts to modify them or alter their interpretation and implementation. For example, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. government signed into law the Tax Act, which includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d It is unclear how efforts to modify or invalidate the Affordable Care Act or its implementing regulations, or portions thereof, will affect the Affordable Care Act or our business.\nFurther, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the Medicare statute to reduce the coverage gap in most Medicare drugs plans, commonly known as the \u201cdonut hole,\u201d by raising the required manufacturer point-of-sale discount from 50% to 70% off the negotiated price effective as of January 1, 2019. Additional legislative changes, regulatory changes, and judicial challenges related to the Affordable Care Act remain possible. We expect that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse\neffect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of XHANCE or to successfully commercialize it.\nWe also expect that the Affordable Care Act, as well as other healthcare reform measures that have been adopted and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for XHANCE and could seriously harm our future revenues. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenues, attain profitability or successfully commercialize XHANCE.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of XHANCE and any other product candidates that we may develop.\nWe currently face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and from our commercialization of XHANCE, and this risk will increase significantly as we further commercialize XHANCE and other product candidates that we may develop. We may face product liability claims, regardless of FDA approval for commercial manufacturing and sale as product liability claims may be brought against us by patients who have used XHANCE in any of our clinical trials, future patients, healthcare providers or others using, administering or selling XHANCE and any of our product candidates, if and when approved. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated adverse effects. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25aadecreased demand for XHANCE;\n\u25aainjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u25aatermination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs that we conduct now or in the future relating to XHANCE or our other product candidates;\n\u25aawithdrawal of clinical trial participants from any current or future clinical trial relating to XHANCE or our other product candidates;\n\u25aasignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u25aasubstantial monetary awards to patients;\n\u25aaloss of revenue;\n\u25aadiversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations; and\n\u25aaan increase in product liability insurance premiums or an inability to maintain product liability insurance coverage.\nWe currently carry product liability insurance with coverage up to $10.0 million in the aggregate, with a per incident limit of $10.0 million, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. Further, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. Our inability to maintain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost could adversely affect our XHANCE product revenues, result in additional liabilities, inhibit the development of XHANCE for additional indications or inhibit the development of our other product candidates. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and business.\nAdditionally, any agreements we may enter into in the future with collaborators in connection with the development or commercialization of XHANCE, our exhalation device technology or any of our other product candidates may entitle us to indemnification against product liability losses, but such indemnification may not be available or adequate should any claim arise. In addition, several of our agreements require us to indemnify third parties and these indemnifications obligations may exceed the coverage under our product liability insurance policy.\nWe are subject to intense competition and, if we are unable to compete effectively, our product candidates, if approved, may not reach their commercial potential.\nThe development and commercialization of new drugs is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change as research provides a deeper understanding of the pathology of diseases and new technologies and treatments are developed. We face competition with respect to XHANCE from prescription and over-the-counter INS, monoclonal antibodies, oral steroids and other medical management products, and will face competition with respect to any other product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from many different sources, including large pharmaceutical, biotechnology, specialty pharmaceutical and, to a lesser degree, medical device companies.\nThe key competitive factors that we expect to impact the commercial success of XHANCE and any other product candidates we may develop are likely to be their efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of administration, price and reimbursement. Nasonex\u2122, marketed by Merck, is currently the only other branded INS drug therapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of nasal polyps, which is our current indication for XHANCE. A generic version of Nasonex\u2122, mometasone furoate monohydrate, was approved by the FDA for, among other indications, the treatment of nasal polyps and launched in 2016. In addition, Beconase AQ\u2122, which is an INS marketed by GlaxoSmithKline, is indicated for the prophylaxis of nasal polyps after surgical resection, SINUVA\u2122 is a commercially available corticosteroid-eluting implant indicated for the treatment of nasal polyps in adult patients who have had ethmoid sinus surgery that can be placed in the ethmoid sinus under endoscopic visualization for up to 90 days, DUPIXENT\u2122, which is a monoclonal antibody marketed by Sanofi and Regeneron, is indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment (to an intranasal steroid) in adult patients with inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis, XOLAIR\u2122, which is a monoclonal antibody marketed by Genentech USA, Inc. and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, is indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment of nasal polyps in adult patients with inadequate response to nasal corticosteroids, and NUCALA\u2122, which is a monoclonal antibody marketed by GlaxoSmithKline, is indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in adult patients with inadequate response to nasal corticosteroids. We are not aware of any drug therapy approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies for the treatment of chronic sinusitis.\nEven though they have not been approved for the treatment of such indications, published clinical practice guidelines do recommend the use of INS products for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps in an effort to maximize medical therapy prior to surgical intervention. Currently approved branded INS products include Rhinocort\u2122, marketed by AstraZeneca, Nasacort AQ\u2122, marketed by Sanofi-Aventis, Beconase AQ\u2122, Flonase\u2122 (which contains the same active pharmaceutical ingredient as XHANCE), and Veramyst\u2122, each marketed by GlaxoSmithKline, Qnasl\u2122, marketed by Teva Pharmaceuticals, and Omnaris\u2122 and Zetonna\u2122, each marketed by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals.\nDue to the limitations of current treatments, several companies are investigating or have investigated the treatment of nasal polyps with monoclonal antibodies. To date, four monoclonal antibodies have been studied in nasal polyps: omalizumab, benralizumab, mepolizumab and dupilumab. In June 2019, the FDA approved DUPIXENT\u2122 (dupilumab) as an add-on maintenance treatment (to an intranasal steroid) in adult patients with inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. In November 2020, the FDA approved XOLAIR\u2122 (omalizumab) add-on maintenance treatment of nasal polyps in adult patients with inadequate response to nasal corticosteroids. And, in July 2021 the FDA approved NUCALA\u2122 (mepolizumab) add-on maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in adult patients with inadequate response to nasal corticosteroids. In addition, Lyra Therapeutics is developing corticosteroid-eluting implants as potential treatment for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Most of these INS and monoclonal antibody companies, as well as other potential competitors, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products.\nMergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval of drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors' drugs, or drugs they may develop in the future, may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render XHANCE or any of our other product candidates we may develop obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing XHANCE or any of our other product candidates. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval of products more rapidly than expected or may obtain better or preferred market access by offering large rebates to payors or by other means. We may not have accurately or completely predicted the development of new and improved or low-cost surgical interventions, alternative medical therapies or other market-disrupting events. If we are unable to manufacture, distribute, stimulate demand reaching the predicted market share, overcome barriers to access or otherwise effectively commercialize the product, all of which factors may be influenced by current or\nfuture competition, then our opportunity to generate revenue from the sale of XHANCE or any of our other product candidates, if approved, will be compromised.\nRisks Related to Clinical Development and Regulatory Approval of XHANCE for the Treatment of Chronic Sinusitis and Our Other Product Candidates\nThe design and execution of clinical trials to support FDA-approval of XHANCE for the treatment of chronic sinusitis is subject to substantial risk and uncertainty.\nWe have initiated a clinical program to support a follow-on indication of XHANCE for the treatment of chronic sinusitis. Recently, the FDA has approved drug products for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and issued a guidance document in November 2021 for clinical trial programs for nasal polyps in which it supports use of the term chronic rhinosinusitis instead of chronic sinusitis. As a result of the FDA's evolving view on terminology for nasal polyps, it is uncertain whether the phase 3 clinical trial program that we are currently conducting for XHANCE would, if positive, support a follow-on indication for the treatment of chronic sinusitis or chronic rhinosinusitis. Nevertheless, we currently intend to submit a prior approval efficacy supplement under our currently approved 505(b)(2) NDA for a follow-on indication for the treatment of chronic sinusitis if data from our ongoing clinical trials is positive. Because there is no FDA-approved product for the treatment of chronic sinusitis, we believe there is substantial risk and uncertainty in planning and conducting adequate clinical trials to meet FDA requirements to support approval for this indication. If the clinical program required by the FDA is more costly or time-consuming than anticipated, we may decide to cease the pursuit of this follow-on indication. Additionally, clinical trials for this indication may not demonstrate sufficient efficacy or safety to support FDA approval for a follow-on indication for XHANCE. If we do not obtain a follow-on indication for the treatment of chronic sinusitis, our promotion of XHANCE will be limited to nasal polyps, which would limit our potential sales of XHANCE.\nThe clinical and regulatory approval processes of the FDA are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business may be substantially harmed.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the FDA. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate's clinical development.\nOur product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:\n\u25aathe FDA may not accept our NDA filing or prior approval efficacy supplement;\n\u25aathe FDA may disagree with the design, scope or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u25aawe may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;\n\u25aawe may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate's clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u25aathe FDA may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u25aathe data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the approval of an NDA;\n\u25aathe FDA may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n\u25aathe approval policies or regulations of the FDA may change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nThe failure to obtain regulatory approval for a particular product candidate, could substantially harm our business.\nClinical development is a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results. Clinical failure can occur at any stage of clinical development.\nClinical trials are expensive, can take many years to complete and have highly uncertain outcomes. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process as a result of inadequate performance of a drug, inadequate adherence by patients or investigators to clinical trial protocols, investigators failure to comply with applicable laws, or other factors. Drug candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through earlier clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials as a result of a lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, despite promising results in earlier trials. Our clinical trials for the follow-on indication of XHANCE for the treatment of chronic sinusitis or our other product candidates may not be successful or may be more expensive or time-consuming than we currently expect. If clinical trials for this or any other product candidate fail to demonstrate safety or efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, the FDA may not approve the follow-on indication of XHANCE or any other product candidate and we would not be able to commercialize it, which could substantially harm our business.\nDelays in clinical trials are common and have many causes, and any delay could result in increased costs to us and jeopardize or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commence product sales, or our ability to maintain regulatory approval.\nWe have experienced and may experience further delays in clinical trials of our product candidates or for our FDA-mandated post-marketing pediatric study for XHANCE, or the time required to complete clinical trials for our product candidates of FDA-mandated post-marketing pediatric study for XHANCE may be longer than anticipated. Our ongoing and future clinical trials may not begin on time, have an effective design, enroll a sufficient number of patients, timely enroll patients, or be completed on schedule, if at all. Our clinical trials can be delayed or terminated for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u25aainability to raise funding necessary to initiate or continue a clinical trial;\n\u25aadelays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial;\n\u25aadelays in reaching agreement with the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities on final trial design or the scope of the development program;\n\u25aaimposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u25aadelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (CROs), and clinical trial sites;\n\u25aadelays in obtaining required IRB approval;\n\u25aainability to attract clinical investigators for trials;\n\u25aadelays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a clinical trial;\n\u25aadelays as a result of interim analyses, if any, of clinical trials that indicate futility of the trial or necessitate an increase in the number of patients enrolled in trial;\n\u25aapatients' delays or failure to complete participation in a clinical trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u25aaadverse side effects;\n\u25aaclinical sites dropping out of a clinical trial;\n\u25aatime required to add new clinical sites;\n\u25aaany shelter-in-place orders from local, state or federal governments or clinical trial site policies resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic that determine essential and non-essential functions and staff, which may impact the ability of site staff to conduct assessments, or result in delays to the conduct of the assessments, as part of our clinical trial protocols, or the ability to enter assessment results into clinical trial databases in a timely manner;\n\u25aadelays by our CMOs to produce and deliver a sufficient supply of clinical trial materials; or\n\u25aagovernmental or regulatory delays, or changes in approval policies or regulations.\nFor example, previous guidance related to the expected timing of results from our ongoing chronic sinusitis trials indicated that top-line results from both trials would be available in the second half of 2021. Pauses in patient enrollment due to factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic have had, and may continue to have, varying effects in different geographies and over time led to a delay in the availability of data from our chronic sinusitis trials and may lead to additional changes in the future. We reported top-line results from our first chronic sinusitis trial in March 2022 and expect to report data from the second trial in the second quarter of 2022.\nIf clinical trials for our product candidates or for our FDA-mandated post-marketing pediatric study for XHANCE are delayed for any of the above reasons or other reasons, our development costs may increase, our approval process could be delayed or negatively impacted and our ability to commercialize our product or product candidates could be materially harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nIf we encounter difficulties in maintaining commercial manufacturing and supply agreements with our third-party manufacturers and suppliers of XHANCE, our ability to commercialize XHANCE would be impaired.\nWe do not own any manufacturing facilities. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing facility. We lack the resources to manufacture and test, on a commercial scale, the technical performance of XHANCE and our other product candidates. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a limited number of experienced personnel and CMOs and suppliers who assist in the production, assembly, test, supply, storage and distribution of XHANCE and its components for commercial and clinical supplies, and we control only some of the aspects of their activities. We may not be able to maintain terms that are favorable to us. We may not be able to enter into commercial manufacturing and supply agreements with any necessary third parties, should such additional agreements become necessary. If we are unable to enter into such agreements or maintain existing agreements, each on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to commercialize XHANCE would be impaired, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. We have initiated the process of qualifying an alternate third-party supplier for select components of XHANCE. Alternate third party suppliers of XHANCE components are subject to qualification and approval from the FDA.\nIf we encounter issues with our contract manufacturers or suppliers, we may need to qualify alternative manufacturers or suppliers, which could impair our ability to sufficiently and timely manufacture and supply XHANCE.\nWe currently depend on contract manufacturers and suppliers for XHANCE and its components. Although we could obtain each of these components from other third-party suppliers, we would need to qualify and obtain FDA approval for another contract manufacturer or supplier as an alternative source for each such component, which could be costly and cause significant delays. For example, we estimate that it would take at least one year to identify and qualify an alternate contract manufacturer for XHANCE. Additionally, our commercial manufacturing and supply agreements generally include limitations on our ability to utilize alternative manufacturers or suppliers for these components above certain specified thresholds during the terms of the agreements, or may include purchase minimums, which impairs our ability to fully implement any future manufacturing strategies to prevent supply shortages or quality issues.\nIn addition, some of our suppliers, including our active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) supplier and our contract manufacturers, conduct their manufacturing operations for us at a single facility. Unless and until we qualify additional facilities, we may face limitations in our ability to respond to manufacturing and supply issues. For example, if regulatory, manufacturing or other problems require one of these manufacturers or suppliers to discontinue production at their respective facility, or if the equipment used for the production of XHANCE in these facilities is significantly damaged or destroyed by fire, flood, earthquake, power loss or similar events, the ability of such manufacturer or supplier to provide components or API needed for XHANCE, or to manufacture XHANCE may be significantly impaired. In the event that these parties suffer a temporary or protracted loss of its facility or equipment, we would still be required to obtain FDA approval to qualify a new manufacturer or supplier, as applicable, as an alternate manufacturer or source for the respective component before any components manufactured by such manufacturer or by such supplier could be sold or used.\nAny production shortfall that impairs the supply of XHANCE or any of its components could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and adversely affect our ability to satisfy demand for XHANCE, which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results materially. We have initiated the process of qualifying an alternate third-party supplier for select components of XHANCE. Alternate third party suppliers of XHANCE components are subject to qualification and approval from the FDA.\nCOVID-19 may also have an adverse impact on our contract manufacturers or suppliers as a result of employees or other key personnel becoming infected, preventive and precautionary measures that governments or such third parties are taking, such as social distancing, quarantines, and other restrictions, and shortages of supplies necessary for the manufacture of XHANCE. Any of these circumstances could adversely impact the ability of third parties on which we rely to manufacture and distribute adequate volumes of XHANCE.\nIf third-party manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors and PPN partners fail to devote sufficient time and resources to XHANCE or their performance is substandard, our product supply may be negatively impacted.\nOur reliance on a limited number of manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors and PPN partners exposes us to the following risks, any of which could limit commercial supply of our products, result in higher costs, or deprive us of potential product revenues:\n\u25aaour CMOs, or other third parties we rely on, may encounter difficulties in achieving the volume of production needed to satisfy commercial demand, may experience technical issues that impact quality or compliance with applicable and strictly enforced regulations governing the manufacture of pharmaceutical products, and may experience shortages of qualified personnel to adequately staff production operations;\n\u25aaour wholesalers, distributors and PPN partners could become unable to sell and deliver XHANCE for regulatory, compliance and other reasons;\n\u25aaour CMOs, wholesalers, distributors and PPN partners could default on their agreements with us to meet our requirements for commercial supply of XHANCE;\n\u25aaour CMOs, wholesalers, distributors and PPN partners may not perform as agreed or may not remain in business for the time required to successfully produce, store, sell and distribute our products and we may incur additional cost; and\n\u25aaif our CMOs, wholesalers, distributors and PPN partners were to terminate our arrangements or fail to meet their contractual obligations, we may be forced to delay or cease sales and ongoing development of XHANCE, or find alternatives that may be more expensive than originally anticipated.\nOur reliance on third parties reduces our control over our product candidate development and commercialization activities but does not relieve us of our responsibility to ensure compliance with all required legal, regulatory and scientific standards. For example, the FDA and other regulatory authorities require that our product candidates and any products that we may eventually commercialize be manufactured according to cGMP and similar foreign standards. Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMP or failure to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of product candidates in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of any of our product candidates or supply our commercial volume of XHANCE. In addition, such failure could be the basis for the FDA to issue a warning or untitled letter, withdraw approvals for product candidates previously granted to us, or take other regulatory or legal action, including recall or seizure, total or partial suspension of production, suspension of ongoing clinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, detention or product, refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunction, imposing civil penalties or pursuing criminal prosecution.We have initiated the process of qualifying an alternate third-party supplier for select components of XHANCE. Alternate third party suppliers of XHANCE components are subject to qualification and approval from the FDA.\nManufacturing issues may arise that could increase product and regulatory approval costs or delay commercialization.\nIssues may arise involving product manufacturing of XHANCE or any of our products that may be under development, including but not limited to delays in receiving finished product or product components, analytical testing issues, product-packaging problems and equipment malfunctions. These issues may require refinement or resolution in order to continue and not delay the commercialization of XHANCE or development of any of our products under development. In addition, quality issues may arise during commercial manufacturing processes or the scale-up of any of our products that may be under development. Any issues in our product or delivery devices could result in increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities, delays in our regulatory approval process, increases in our operating expenses, shortages in our products available for sales or clinical trial use, decreases in sales to customers, or failure to obtain or maintain approval for our products. We have initiated the process of qualifying an alternate third-party supplier for select components of XHANCE. Alternate third party suppliers of XHANCE components are subject to qualification and approval from the FDA.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, or if they terminate their agreement with us, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon CROs to monitor and manage data for our prospective preclinical and clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of our clinical trials, and we control only some of the aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies and clinical trials are conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs are required to comply with federal regulations and current GCP, which are international standards meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, advisors and monitors. GCPs are enforced by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities in the form of International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines for all of our product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce GCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP and other regulations, including as a result of any recent changes in such regulations, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP requirements. While we have agreements governing activities of our CROs, we have limited influence over their actual performance. Failure to comply with applicable regulations in the conduct of the clinical trials for our product candidates may require us to repeat preclinical studies and clinical trials, which would increase our operating expenses and delay the regulatory approval process.\nOur CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical and preclinical programs. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons or if we receive additional FDA notices that do require corrective action, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase substantially and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.\nSwitching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. Identifying, qualifying and managing performance of third-party service providers can be difficult, time-consuming and cause delays in our development programs. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work and the new CRO may not provide the same type or level of services as the original provider. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects. If any of our relationships with our CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. As a result, delays may occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines.\nBecause we have relied on third parties, our internal capacity to perform these functions is limited. Outsourcing these functions involves risks that third parties may not perform to our standards, may not produce results in a timely manner or may fail to perform at all. In addition, the use of third-party service providers requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that this information will be misappropriated. We currently have a small number of employees, which limits the internal resources we have available to identify and monitor our third-party providers. To the extent we are unable to identify and successfully manage the performance of third-party service providers in the future, our ability to advance our product candidates through clinical trials will be compromised. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry\nOur long-term growth depends on our ability to develop and commercialize additional ENT and allergy products.\nIt is important to our business that we continue to build a more complete product offering within the ENT and allergy markets. We are evaluating the use of our proprietary EDS device technology to develop new product candidates\nfor the ENT and allergy markets. Developing additional product candidates is expensive and time-consuming and could divert management's attention away from the commercialization of XHANCE. Even if we are successful in developing additional product candidates, the success of any new product candidates or enhancement to any existing product candidates will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\n\u25aaproperly identify and anticipate ENT and allergy physician and patient needs;\n\u25aadevelop, obtain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals, and introduce new product candidates or product enhancements in a timely manner;\n\u25aademonstrate, if required, the safety and efficacy of new product candidates with data from preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u25aaavoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties;\n\u25aacomply with all regulations relating to the marketing of new product candidates, including any new or modified EDS technologies; and\n\u25aaprovide adequate training to potential users of our product candidates.\nIf we are unsuccessful in developing, acquiring or licensing additional product candidates in other areas of the ENT and allergy markets, our ability to gain and maintain profitability may be impaired.\nWe are subject to risks inherent in foreign operations.\nWe currently operate portions of our business through our foreign subsidiaries, including through our Norwegian subsidiary, OptiNose AS, which currently owns a substantial portion of our intellectual property and conducts development activities. We also have our United Kingdom subsidiary, OptiNose UK Ltd., which currently has no employees. We have committed, and intend to continue to commit, resources to our international operations. The operations we conduct in other countries, including clinical trials, and the operations conducted by third party suppliers and vendors with whom we do business, are subject to foreign laws. We are subject to a number of risks associated with our international business operations and activities that may increase liability, costs, and require significant management attention. These risks include:\n\u25aacompliance with the laws of the U.S., the United Kingdom, Norway, and other countries that apply to our international operations, including import and export legislation;\n\u25aacompliance with foreign data protection laws and regulations in the United Kingdom, Norway and other countries that apply to our international operations;\n\u25aathe complexities and expenses of administering a business abroad;\n\u25aacomplications in compliance with, and unexpected changes in, tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other foreign regulatory requirements, including potential trade conflicts, changes to trade agreements/treaties, and the implementation of trade restrictions;\n\u25aainstability in economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession and actual or anticipated military conflicts, social upheaval or political uncertainty;\n\u25aaproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad;\n\u25aauncertainties of laws and enforcement relating to the protection of intellectual property or secured technology;\n\u25aalitigation in foreign court systems;\n\u25aalanguage barriers;\n\u25aachanges in tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate;\n\u25aacompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws, regulations and restrictions for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u25aadifficulties staffing and managing foreign operations; and\n\u25aaworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the U.S.\nThere can be no assurance that the policies and procedures we implement to address or mitigate these risks will be successful, that our personnel will comply with them or that we will not experience these risks in the future or that they will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur corporate structure and foreign operations may have adverse tax consequences and expose us to additional tax liabilities. In addition, tax returns we file are subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign tax authorities.\nWe have operations in Norway and the UK and a substantial portion of our intellectual property, including certain rights to XHANCE, are owned by OptiNose AS, our Norwegian subsidiary. We file tax returns in various jurisdictions and those returns are subject to examination by the tax authorities. During an examination, a tax authority could challenge positions taken on a return. Such a challenge could result in the loss of tax attributes or in the payment of tax which could have an unfavorable impact on our financial condition.\nWe operate pursuant to written intercompany license, service and related agreements that establish prices for intellectual property and for services provided such as production, marketing, management, and technology development activities that are performed by one group company for another group company. The amounts paid under these intercompany agreements are commonly considered for tax purposes as transfer prices. If the affiliated companies are located in different countries, the tax laws and regulations of each country generally require that transfer prices be at arm\u2019s length as if between unrelated companies. Our transfer pricing arrangements consider requirements of the jurisdictions in which we operate but are not binding on the tax authorities. If any tax authority is successful in challenging our transfer prices, there could be an increase in taxable income in that jurisdiction which could increase our tax liabilities. Further, if the tax authority in the other country does not agree with the adjustment, both countries could tax the same income, resulting in double taxation.\nAny income earned by our foreign subsidiaries, including a portion of the sales of XHANCE in the U.S., may be subject to additional tax liabilities. If our foreign operations generate cash that we want to repatriate to the U.S. or if cash generated by our U.S. operations is not sufficient to fund our U.S. operations, we may face additional tax liabilities in returning or otherwise providing such cash to support our U.S. operations or other strategic opportunities in the U.S. If we are forced to repatriate any foreign-held cash, we could incur a significant tax charge, and our business, operating results or financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nIf foreign subsidiary income is subject to the Subpart F, investment in US property or global intangible low-taxed income provisions, or similar provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, collectively referred to in this paragraph as Subpart F, the income may be subject to U.S. corporate income tax even if there is no cash distribution of those earnings to the U.S. For example, Subpart F income includes certain \"passive\" income, certain income from intercompany transactions, foreign subsidiary income over a legislative threshold or income of a foreign subsidiary which makes an \"investment in U.S. property\", such as holding the stock in a U.S. corporation. Any foreign subsidiary income subject to the Subpart F provisions would be included in determining U.S. taxable income and potentially subject to federal corporate income tax at rates up to 21%.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights are inadequate to protect our technology, XHANCE or our other product candidates, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology similar to ours, and our competitive position could be harmed.\nOur commercial success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection in the U.S. and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, and confidentiality and other agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. Our strategy is to seek patent protection for XHANCE, our other product candidates and their compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, and any other aspects of inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we and any future licensors and licensees may not be able to apply for or prosecute patents on certain aspects of our product candidates or delivery technologies at a reasonable cost, in a timely fashion, or at all. We may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the rights to patents licensed to third parties. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. It is also possible that we, or any future licensors or licensees, will fail to identify patentable aspects\nof inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. Therefore, our patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. It is possible that defects of form in the preparation or filing of our patents or patent applications may exist, or may arise in the future, such as with respect to proper priority claims, inventorship, claim scope or patent term adjustments. If any future licensors or licensees are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the prosecution, maintenance, or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised and we might not be able to prevent third parties from making, using, and selling competing products. If there are material defects in the form or preparation of our patents or patent applications, such patents or applications may be invalid or unenforceable. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods, and know-how. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical companies generally are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and have in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of any patents that issue, are highly uncertain. The steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, both inside and outside the U.S. Further, the examination process may require us to narrow the claims of pending patent applications, which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained if these applications issue. The rights that may be granted under future issued patents may not provide us with the proprietary protection or competitive advantages we are seeking. If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficient, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or superior to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired.\nAs of February 1, 2022, we owned over 60 U.S. patents, with additional pending U.S. patent applications. Our issued U.S. patents expire between 2022 and 2035. We do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in issued patents or, if any of our patent applications do issue, whether such patents will protect our technology and drugs, in whole or in part, or whether such patents will effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. There is no guarantee that any of our issued or granted patents will not later be found invalid or unenforceable. Furthermore, as our issued patents expire, the risk that competitors may be able to circumvent our remaining patents by developing similar or alternate technologies or products in a non-infringing manner is increased. Two of our 13 patents listed in the FDA's Orange Book for XHANCE are set to expire from 2022 to 2023. These patents cover certain aspects of our exhalation deliver system technology utilized by XHANCE.\nThe laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. or vice versa. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than U.S. law does. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the U.S. and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all, until they are issued as a patent. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications, that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions, or that we have found all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications that could invalidate one or more of our patents or prevent one or more of our patent applications from issuing. Even if patents do successfully issue and even if such patents cover our product candidates, third parties may initiate oppositions, interferences, re-examinations, post-grant reviews, inter partes reviews, nullification or derivation actions in court or before patent offices or similar proceedings challenging the validity, enforceability, or scope of such patents, which may result in the patent claims being narrowed or invalidated. For example, in 2020 a third party filed an opposition in Europe to the issuance of one of our patents covering certain aspects of our flexible mouthpiece. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our product candidates, or prevent others from designing around our claims. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties.\nFurthermore, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the U.S. and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and drugs, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and drugs. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new drug candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a\nresult, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing drugs similar or identical to ours.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors or other third parties may infringe our patents or the patents of any party from whom we may license patents from in the future. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In a patent litigation in the U.S., defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, for example, lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable. A court may decide that a patent of ours or of any of our future licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. In addition, to the extent that we have to file patent litigation in a federal court against a U.S. patent holder, we would be required to initiate the proceeding in the state of incorporation or residency of such entity. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that no invalidating prior art exists. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, found unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly, and it could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on one or more of our products or certain aspects of our EDS technology. Such a loss of patent protection could compromise our ability to pursue our business strategy.\nInterference proceedings brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents and patent applications or those of our collaborators or licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if a prevailing party does not offer us a license on terms that are acceptable to us. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distraction of our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone, with our licensees, or with any of our future licensors, misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the U.S. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO or other foreign patent offices, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or drugs and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize drugs without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop, or commercialize current or future product candidates.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on XHANCE, our other product candidates and our EDS technology throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the U.S. may be less extensive than those in the U.S. In addition, the laws and practices of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights, especially those relating to life sciences, to the same extent as federal and state laws in the U.S. For example, novel formulations of existing drugs and manufacturing processes may not be patentable in certain jurisdictions, and the requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. Also, some foreign countries, including European Union countries, India, Japan and China, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled under certain circumstances to grant licenses to third parties. Consequently, we may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we are compelled to grant a license to a third party, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the U.S., or from selling or importing products made using our inventions into or\nwithin the U.S. or other jurisdictions. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products, and may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the U.S. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing with us in these jurisdictions. Furthermore, the prevalence of counterfeit medicines, which is one that has been deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled as to its identity and source, is a significant and growing industry-wide issue that could impact our revenue and our reputation for which we may have limited or no recourse. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from our intellectual property. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate in these foreign countries and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and applications are required to be paid to the USPTO and various governmental patent agencies outside of the U.S. in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and applications. The USPTO and various non-U.S. governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process and after a patent has issued. There are situations in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which could be uncertain and could harm our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell XHANCE and our other product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. While our product candidates are in preclinical studies and clinical trials, we believe that the use of our product candidates in these preclinical studies and clinical trials falls within the scope of the exemptions provided by 35 U.S.C. Section 271(e) in the U.S., which exempts from patent infringement liability activities reasonably related to the development and submission of information to the FDA. As XHANCE and Onzetra Xsail are commercialized and our other product candidates progress toward commercialization, the possibility of a patent infringement claim against us increases. For instance, if we use the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for the follow-on indication of chronic sinusitis or any of our other product candidates it will require us to provide a Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders of the RLD pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act if the RLD is covered by Orange Book-listed patents. If the NDA or patent holder files a patent infringement lawsuit against us within 45 days of its receipt of notice of our certification, the FDA is prevented from approving our Section 505(b)(2) NDA until the earliest of 30 months, expiration of the patents, settlement of the lawsuit or a court decision in the infringement case that is favorable to us. Accordingly, we may invest significant time and expense in the development of our product candidates only to be subject to significant delay and expensive and time-consuming patent litigation before our product candidates may be commercialized. There can be no assurance that our product candidates do not infringe other parties' patents or other proprietary rights and competitors or other parties may assert that we infringe their proprietary rights in any event.\nThere is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our product candidates, including interference or derivation proceedings before the USPTO. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing our drug candidates. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party's intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue commercializing our product candidates. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if a license can be obtained on acceptable terms, the rights may be non-exclusive, which could give our competitors access to the same technology or intellectual property rights licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license, we may be unable to effectively market product candidates based on our technology, which could limit our ability to generate revenue or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations. Alternatively, we may need to redesign our infringing products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. Under certain circumstances, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing our product\ncandidates. In addition, in any such proceeding or litigation, we could be found liable for substantial monetary damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys' fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could harm our business. Any claims by third parties that we have misappropriated their confidential information or trade secrets could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nThe cost to us in defending or initiating any litigation or other proceeding relating to patent or other proprietary rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and litigation would divert our management's attention. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could compromise our commercialization efforts, delay our research and development efforts and limit our ability to continue our operations. There could also be public announcements of the results of the hearing, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive those results to be negative, it could cause the price of shares of our common stock to decline.\nOur competitors may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.\nOur competitors may seek to market generic versions of XHANCE or any other product for which we obtain approval by submitting ANDAs to the FDA or new products that use our approved products as the RLD, in each case where our competitors claim that our patents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. Alternatively, our competitors may seek approval to market their own products that are the same as, similar to or otherwise competitive with XHANCE and any future product candidates we may develop. In these circumstances, we may need to defend or assert our patents, by means including filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement requiring us to engage in complex, lengthy and costly litigation or other proceedings. In any of these types of proceedings, a court or government agency with jurisdiction may find our patents invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. We may also fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Even if we have valid and enforceable patents, these patents still may not provide protection against competing products or processes sufficient to achieve our business objectives. Furthermore, as our issued patents expire, the risk that competitors may be able to circumvent our remaining patents by developing similar or alternate technologies or products in a non-infringing manner is increased. Two of our 13 remaining patents listed in the FDA's Orange Book for XHANCE are set to expire from 2022 to 2023. These patents cover certain aspects of our exhalation deliver system technology utilized by XHANCE.\nChanges in either U.S. or foreign patent law or interpretation of such laws could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nAs is the case with other pharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the pharmaceutical industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and it therefore is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, on September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the AIA) was signed into law. The AIA includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation.\nAn important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March 16, 2013, the U.S. transitioned to a \"first-to-file\" system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after that date, but before us, could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by the third party. This will require us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent application.\nAmong some of the other changes introduced by the AIA are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and providing opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. This applies to all of our U.S. patents, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard necessary to invalidate a patent claim in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in U.S. federal court, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action.\nDepending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, the USPTO, or similar authorities in foreign jurisdictions, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nWe may be subject to claims asserting that our employees, consultants, independent contractors and advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information and/or alleged trade secrets of their current or former employers or claims asserting ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nAlthough we try to ensure that our employees, consultants, independent contractors and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these individuals or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information and/or intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of the companies that any such individual currently or formerly worked for or provided services to. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our business.\nIn addition, while we require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIntellectual property rights do not prevent all potential threats to competitive advantages we may have.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and intellectual property rights may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage.\nThe following examples are illustrative:\n\u25aaOthers may be able to make drug and device components that are the same as or similar to XHANCE and our other product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u25aaWe or any of our licensors or collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u25aaWe or any of our licensors or collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u25aaOthers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u25aaThe prosecution of our pending patent applications may not result in granted patents;\n\u25aaGranted patents that we own or have licensed may not cover our products or may be held not infringed, invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\u25aaWith respect to granted patents that we own or have licensed, especially patents that we either acquire or in-license, if certain information was withheld from or misrepresented to the patent examiner, such patents might be held to be unenforceable;\n\u25aaPatent protection on our product candidates may expire before we are able to develop and commercialize the product, or before we are able to recover our investment in the product;\n\u25aaOur competitors might conduct research and development activities in the U.S. and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for such activities, as well as in countries in which we do not have patent rights, and may then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in markets where we intend to market our product candidates;\n\u25aaWe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u25aaThe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business; and\n\u25aaWe may choose not to file a patent application for certain technologies, trade secrets or know-how, and a third party may subsequently file a patent covering such intellectual property.\nShould any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patent protection for certain aspects of our product candidates and delivery technologies, we also consider trade secrets, including confidential and unpatented know-how, important to the maintenance of our competitive position. We protect trade secrets and confidential and unpatented know-how, in part, by customarily entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to such knowledge, such as our employees, outside scientific and commercial collaborators, CROs, CMOs, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to maintain confidentiality and assign their inventions to us. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known, including through a potential cybersecurity breach, or may be independently developed by competitors.\nEnforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nIf our trademarks are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe expect to rely on trademarks as one means to distinguish any of our product candidates that are approved for marketing from the products of our competitors. OPTINOSE\u00ae and XHANCE\u00ae are registered trademarks of ours in the U.S. Our trademarks may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks or may be forced to stop using these names, which we need for name recognition by potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. If we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this \"Risk Factors\" section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, these factors include:\n\u25aaour ability to successfully commercialize XHANCE;\n\u25aaany delay in our regulatory approval or filings for XHANCE for a follow-on indication for the treatment of chronic sinusitis or any other product candidate we may develop, and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the applicable regulatory authority's review of such filings, including without limitation the FDA's issuance of a \"refusal to file\" letter, a request for additional information, or a CRL;\n\u25aathe success of competitive products, technologies or services;\n\u25aaadverse regulatory actions with respect to our product candidates, including the failure to receive regulatory approval, or our competitors' products or product candidates;\n\u25aadiscovery of previously unknown problems with XHANCE, such as AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency,\n\u25aaissues involving manufacturing of XHANCE or any of our products that may be under development;\n\u25aaactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u25aaannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or divestitures, strategic collaborations, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u25aathe impact of COVID-19 on our business, including the manufacture, supply, distribution and sale of XHANCE;\n\u25aathe commencement, enrollment or results of planned clinical trials of our product candidates or any future clinical trials we may conduct, or any changes generally in the development status of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u25aaregulatory or legal developments in the U.S. and other countries;\n\u25aathe outcome of any investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or litigation that may be brought against us;\n\u25aadevelopments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u25aathe level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u25aaactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u25aaour ability to develop, acquire or license additional product candidates in other areas of the ENT and allergy markets;\n\u25aafailure to meet the estimates and projections of the investment community or financial guidance that we may otherwise provide to the public;\n\u25aaactual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25aaactual or anticipated changes in estimates as to development timelines that we may provide to the public;\n\u25aavariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25aafluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u25aashare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u25aaannouncement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u25aasales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders;\n\u25aasignificant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u25aachanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u25aamarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u25aageneral political, economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u25aainvestors' general perception of our company and our business;\n\u25aapublication of research reports about us, our competitors or our industry, or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities or industry analysts; and\n\u25aaother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and pharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks stated above could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. If our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nAs of March 1, 2022, there were 82,418,106 outstanding shares of our common stock. Holders of an aggregate of 14,461,137 shares of our common stock have rights, subject to specified conditions, that require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. Of these shares, 14,273,017 are already covered by a registration statement and may be sold in the public market pursuant to such registration statement. Additionally, these shares are also eligible for sale without registration under Rule 144, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nFuture issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe will likely require additional capital in the future to execute our business plan. To raise capital, we may sell substantial amounts of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock. These future issuances of common stock or common stock-related securities, together with the exercise of outstanding options, restricted stock units, warrants and any additional shares issued in connection with acquisitions, if any, may result in material dilution to our investors and may cause our stock price to fall. Such sales may also result in new investors receiving rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a substantial percentage of our stock and are able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval, which could prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nOur executive officers, directors, beneficial owners of 5% or more of our capital stock and their respective affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially own approximately 49.8% of our outstanding common stock as of March 1, 2022. Entities associated with Avista Capital Partners II, L.P. (Avista), our largest stockholder, collectively hold as a group approximately 17.3% of our outstanding common stock as of March 1, 2022. Additionally, entities associated with MVM Partners, LLC (MVM) collectively hold as a group approximately 15.2% of our outstanding stock as of March 1, 2022. As a result, Avista and MVM can significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest. The interests of Avista and MVM may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their common stock. For instance, and specifically with respect to Avista, under the terms of our fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation, neither Avista nor any of its respective representatives whom in the future may be on our board of directors are required to offer us any transaction opportunity of which they become aware, and they could take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment, unless that opportunity is expressly offered to a person serving on our board of directors solely in his or her capacity as one of our directors. These actions might affect the prevailing market price for our common stock. In addition, because Avista and certain of our other principal stockholders have held their shares for several years, they may be more interested in selling our company than other investors, or they may want us to pursue strategies that deviate from the interests of other stockholders. Such concentration of ownership control may also:\n\u25aadelay, defer or prevent a change in control;\n\u25aaentrench our management and/or the board of directors; or\n\u25aaimpede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us that other stockholders may desire.\nWe may also take actions that our other stockholders do not view as beneficial, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and cause the value of your investment to decline.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, or remove our current management. These include provisions that:\n\u25aapermit our board of directors to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as it may designate, which issuance could result in the loss of voting control by other stockholders;\n\u25aaprovide that our board of directors will be classified into three classes with staggered, three-year terms and that, subject to the rights of Avista to remove its respective director nominees with or without cause, directors may only be removed for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of outstanding shares of our capital stock;\n\u25aasubject to any director nomination rights afforded Avista, provide that all vacancies on our board of directors, including as a result of newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u25aarequire that any action to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and not be taken by written consent;\n\u25aaprovide that, with the exception of director nominees submitted by Avista pursuant to our Stockholders Agreement, dated October 2, 2017 with Avista, stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of stockholders must provide advance notice in writing, and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder's notice;\n\u25aarequire that the amendment of certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to anti-takeover measures may only be approved by a vote of 662/3% of our outstanding common stock;\n\u25aarequire that the amendment of our bylaws be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office or 662/3% of our outstanding common stock entitled to vote thereon;\n\u25aado not provide for cumulative voting rights, thereby allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election; and\n\u25aaprovide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman or vice chairman of our board of directors, our chief executive officer, or a majority of our board of directors.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management. Under our fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we have elected not to be governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law until such time that Avista ceases to own 15% or more of our capital stock. Our fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation does, however, contain a provision that generally mirrors Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, except that it excludes Avista and its affiliates from the definition of \"interested stockholder.\" At such time that Avista ceases to own 15% or more of our capital stock, we will be governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Under Section 203, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, prior to the time the stockholder has become an interested stockholder, the board of directors has approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder.\nThese provisions of our fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law could have the effect of discouraging potential acquisition proposals and delaying or preventing a change in control. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock, including transactions that may be in your best interests or provide an opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock. These provisions could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation also provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware and any appellate courts thereof will be the exclusive forum for resolving any such complaint for which subject matter jurisdiction of such claim is vested exclusively in the federal courts of the U.S. These choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company\" and intend to take advantage of reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could result in our common stock being less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act) and we are eligible to and intend to take advantage of some of the exemptions from reporting requirements applicable to other public companies, but not to emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure about executive compensation arrangements pursuant to the rules applicable to smaller reporting companies and no requirement to seek non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, December 31, 2022, (2) the beginning of the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenue is $1.07 billion or more, (3) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities and (4) the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we have chosen to \"opt out\" of such extended transition period and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our choices, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may also be unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe may acquire other assets or businesses, or form collaborations or make investments in other companies or technologies, which could negatively impact our operating results, dilute our stockholders' ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of assets, including preclinical, clinical or commercial-stage products or product candidates, businesses or strategic alliances and collaborations, to expand our existing technologies and operations. We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and if we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to complete technology transfers and integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we may incur additional debt or assume unknown or contingent liabilities as part of the transaction. Integration of an acquired company or assets may also disrupt ongoing operations, require the hiring of additional personnel and the implementation of additional internal systems and infrastructure, especially the acquisition of commercial assets, and require management resources that would otherwise focus on developing our existing business. We may not be able to find suitable strategic collaborators or identify other investment opportunities, and we may experience losses related to any such investments.\nTo finance any acquisitions or collaborations, we may choose to issue debt or shares of our common or preferred stock as consideration. Any such issuance of shares would dilute the ownership of our stockholders. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other assets or companies or fund a transaction using our stock as consideration. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds for acquisitions through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\nOur sales force and other employees, PPN partners, CMOs, CROs, principal investigators, co-promotion partners, collaborators, independent contractors, consultants and other vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our sales force and other employees, PPN partners, CMOs, CROs, principal investigators, collaborators, independent contractors, consultants and other vendors may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity with respect to our business. Misconduct by these employees could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or unauthorized activity that violates:\n\u25aaFDA promotion or other regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA;\n\u25aamanufacturing standards;\n\u25aafederal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations; or\n\u25aalaws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data.\nIn particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct by these parties could also involve individually identifiable information, including, without limitation, the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, or illegal misappropriation of drug product, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. Any incidents or any other conduct that leads to an employee receiving an FDA debarment could result in a loss of business from third parties and severe reputational harm.\nWe have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to govern and deter such behaviors, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and curtailment of our operations.\nIf we fail to comply with data and privacy protection laws and regulations, we could be subject to government enforcement actions, which could include civil or criminal penalties, as well as private litigation and/or adverse publicity, any of which could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S., state and international data and privacy protection laws. In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act) govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. Compliance with these laws is difficult, constantly evolving, and time consuming. These laws may differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. Many of the state laws enable a state attorney general to bring actions and provide private rights of action to consumers as enforcement mechanisms. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (which could include civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity. Federal regulators, state attorneys general, and plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys have been and will likely continue to be active in this space. We may also obtain health information from third parties (e.g., healthcare providers who prescribe our products) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA, and other privacy and data security and consumer protection laws. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA, other than potentially with respect to providing certain employee benefits, we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we, our affiliates, or our agents knowingly receive individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA, and could also potentially be subject to other civil and/or criminal penalties if we obtain, use or disclose information in a manner not permitted by other privacy and data security and consumer protection laws.\nThe Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) also sets expectations for failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers\u2019 personal information secure, or failing to provide a level of security commensurate to promises made to individual about the security of their personal information (such as in a privacy notice) may constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act. The FTC expects a company\u2019s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. With respect to privacy, the FTC also sets expectations that companies honor the privacy promises made to individuals about how the company handles consumers\u2019 personal information; any failure to honor promises, such as the statements made in a privacy policy or on a website, may also constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of the FTC Act. While we do not intend to engage in unfair or deceptive acts or practices, the FTC has the power to enforce promises as it interprets them, and events that we cannot fully control, such as data breaches, may be result in FTC enforcement. Enforcement by the FTC under the FTC Act can result in civil penalties or enforcement actions.\nAdditionally, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), applicable in the European Union (EU), applies to our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services that we may offer to EU users that involve the collection, use, storage, transfer, and other processing of personal data, including personal health data. The GDPR creates a range of new compliance obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, which could cause us to change our business practices, and has significantly increased financial penalties for noncompliance (including possible fines of up to 4% of global annual turnover for the preceding financial year or \u20ac20 million (whichever is higher) for the most serious infringements). In particular, these obligations and restrictions concern the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the sharing of personal data with third parties, the transfer of personal data out of the EU, security breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data and imposition of substantial potential fines for violations of the data protection obligations. Specifically regarding the transfer of personal data outside of the EU, while there are legal mechanisms available to lawfully transfer personal data outside of the EU, including to the United States, there are certain unsettled legal issues regarding such data transfers, the resolution of which may adversely affect our ability to transfer personal data or otherwise may cause us to incur significant costs to come into compliance with applicable data transfer impact assessments and implementation of legal data transfer mechanisms. On July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice ruled the EU-US Privacy Shield to be an invalid data transfer mechanism and confirmed that the Model Clauses remain valid, and in June 2021, the European Commission published updated versions of the Model Clauses, which must be incorporated into new and existing agreements within prescribed timeframes in order to continue to lawfully transfer personal data outside of the EU. Data protection authorities from the different EU member states, as well as in the United Kingdom and Switzerland, have promulgated national privacy laws that impose additional requirements,\nwhich add to the complexity of processing and transferring EU personal data, with the United Kingdom and Switzerland following the EU with the publication of new Model Clauses to be incorporated in all applicable contracts within a specified timeframe in order to legitimize data transfers from those jurisdictions. Our ability to continue to transfer personal data outside of the EU, United Kingdom, or Switzerland may become significantly more costly and may subject us to increased scrutiny and liability under the GDPR or similar local laws, and we may experience operating disruptions if we are unable to conduct these transfers in the future.\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, establishes certain requirements for data use and sharing transparency and provides California residents certain rights concerning the use, disclosure, and retention of their personal data. The CCPA and its implementing regulations have already been amended multiple times since their enactment. In November 2020, California voters approved the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) ballot initiative, which introduced significant amendments to the CCPA and established and funded a dedicated California privacy regulator, the California Privacy Protection Agency. The amendments introduced by the CPRA go into effect on January 1, 2023, and new implementing regulations are expected to be introduced by the California Privacy Protection Agency. Failure to comply with the CCPA may result in, among other things, significant civil penalties and injunctive relief, or potential statutory or actual damages. In addition, California residents have the right to bring a private right of action in connection with certain types of incidents. These claims may result in significant liability and potential damages. We implemented processes to manage compliance with the CCPA and continue to assess the impact of the CPRA, and other state legislation, on our business as additional information and guidance becomes available. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and may impose limitations on our activities or otherwise adversely affect our business. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, and in other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services and research activities. These laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or any other government actions may lead to unfavorable outcomes including increased compliance costs, delays or impediments in the development of new products, negative publicity, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, and remedies that harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\nCertain of these laws and regulations are described in greater detail in the previous section under \"Business - Government Regulation - Healthcare Privacy Laws.\" If we, our agents, or our third party partners fail to comply or are alleged to have failed to comply with these or other applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations, or if we were to experience a data breach involving personal information, we could be subject to government enforcement actions or private lawsuits. Any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or other government actions could lead to unfavorable outcomes that have a material impact on our business including through significant penalties or fines, monetary judgments or settlements including criminal and civil liability for us and our officers and directors, increased compliance costs, delays or impediments in the development of new products, negative publicity, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, or other remedies that harm our business, including orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyberattacks or a deficiency in our cybersecurity or those of any business partners.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contractors, vendors, customers and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures, cyberattacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, loss of funds or information from phishing or other fraudulent schemes, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization or those with whom we do business. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Such an event could cause interruption of our operations or loss of Company funds and have a negative financial consequence on our business. For example, the loss of data from completed or ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data, or could result in a delay of the services provided by our vendor. Although we are targeted for cyber-attacks from time to time, we are only aware of one instance where an unauthorized third party accessed certain parts of our computer systems and we believe we have addressed the matter without any known financial implication, loss of data or exposure of confidential or personal information. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were\nto result in a loss of or damage to our data, misappropriation of funds to unintended recipients, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential, proprietary or personal information, we could incur material legal claims and liabilities and damage to our reputation and the development and commercialization of XHANCE and our other product candidates could be delayed. Additionally, breach remediation costs may be significant. Despite our efforts and the ever-changing threat landscape, the possibility of these events occurring cannot be eliminated entirely and there can be no assurance that any measures we take will prevent cyber-attacks or security breaches that could adversely affect our business.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other U.S. and foreign anti-corruption anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions, and other trade laws and regulations, and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (FCPA), the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, and possibly other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries outside of the U.S. in which we conduct our activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting, or accepting, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to or from any person whether in the public or private sector. As we commercialize XHANCE and any other product candidates that we may develop, we may engage with third-party manufacturers and collaborators who operate abroad and are required to obtain certain necessary permits, licenses and other regulatory approvals with respect to our business. Our activities abroad create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors, even though they may not always be subject to our control. We have implemented policies to discourage these practices by our employees, consultants, sales agents and distributors. However, our employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors of our company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities.\nNoncompliance with anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions, and other trade laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension and/or debarment from contracting with certain persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed. Responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management's attention and resources and significant defense and compliance costs and other professional fees. In addition, the U.S. government may seek to hold us liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. As a general matter, enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 16992, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "OPTN"}
