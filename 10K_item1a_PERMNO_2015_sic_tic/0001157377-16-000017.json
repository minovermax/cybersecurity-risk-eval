{"cik": "1157377", "company": "ADVISORY BOARD CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe describe below what we believe are currently the material risks and uncertainties we face, but they are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, also may become important factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nBecause most of our members are in the health care industry, factors that adversely affect the financial condition of the health care industry could have a negative impact on us.\nWe historically have derived most of our revenue from members in the health care industry. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by conditions affecting the health care industry generally and hospitals and health systems in particular. Our ability to grow will depend on the economic environment of the health care industry as well as our ability to increase the number and the breadth of the services that we sell to our members. There are many factors that could affect the purchasing practices, operations, and, ultimately, the operating funds of health care organizations, such as reimbursement policies for health care expenses, consolidation in the health care industry, and regulation, litigation, and general economic conditions. Because of current macro-economic conditions, many health care delivery organizations continue to experience deteriorating cash flow, access to credit, and budgets. It is unclear what long-term effects general economic conditions will have on the health care industry and in turn on us.\nThe health care industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory, and other influences. Existing and new federal and state laws and regulations affecting the health care industry could create unexpected liabilities for us, could cause us or our members to incur additional costs, and could restrict our or our members\u2019 operations. Many health care laws are complex and their application to us, our members, or the specific services and relationships we have with our members is not always clear. In addition, federal and state legislatures periodically have considered programs to reform or amend the U.S. health care system at both the federal and state level, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, and we expect that additional federal and state health care reform measures will be adopted in the future.\nBecause of the significant implementation issues arising under these laws and because regulations for implementing these laws are being released on an ongoing basis, it is unclear what long-term effects such issues they will have on the health care industry and in turn on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Among other effects, we could be required to make unplanned modifications of our products and services or could suffer delays or cancellations of orders or reductions in demand for our products and services as a result of changes in regulations affecting the health care industry, such as any increased regulation by governmental agencies of the purchase and sale of medical products, changes to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1995, and the regulations that have been issued under it, which we refer to collectively as HIPAA, and other federal or state privacy laws, laws relating to the tax-exempt status of many of our members, or restrictions on permissible discounts and other financial arrangements. Our failure to anticipate accurately the application of these laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with them, could create liability for us, result in adverse publicity, and negatively affect our business.\nFederal and state regulations governing our members in the education industry may negatively affect our members\u2019 businesses, marketing practices, and budgets, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue.\nWe expect to derive an increasing amount of revenue from post-secondary educational institutions. Such educational institutions are subject to extensive federal and state regulation, including the Higher Education Act, Department of Education regulations, and individual state higher education regulations. The regulations govern many aspects of the operations of our higher education members, including marketing and recruiting activities, as well as their eligibility to participate in Title IV federal student financial aid programs, which is the principal source of funding for many of our members. There recently have been significant changes to these regulations, and a high level of regulatory activity and heightened legislative scrutiny is expected to continue. Changes in, new interpretations of, or noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations, standards, or policies applicable to our members could have a material adverse effect on their accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, or receipt of funds under Title IV programs, any of which, in turn, may harm our ability to generate revenue from these members and thereby negatively affect our financial results.\nPrivacy and security laws may increase the costs of operation and expose us to civil and criminal sanctions.\nThe privacy and security of personally identifiable information, also known as personal data, is a major issue in our industries. We must comply with extensive requirements regarding the use, disclosure, retention, and security of personal data, including patient health care information. Failure by us to comply with any of the applicable laws, regulations, and standards regarding privacy, identity theft prevention and detection, breach notification, and data security may subject us to actual or threatened proceedings, actions, and public statements against us by government entities, private parties, consumer advocacy groups, or others, including civil monetary penalties and, in some circumstances, criminal penalties or contractual liability under our agreements with our members. In addition, any such failure may harm our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain existing members and attract new members.\nRecently, there has been an increase in public awareness of privacy issues in the wake of revelations about data security breaches suffered by well-known companies and institutions and the activities of various government agencies and lawsuits filed in response to these breaches. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personally identifiable information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded and even if we are in compliance with applicable laws, could damage our reputation and harm our business. In addition, we may incur significant costs in monitoring and complying with the multitude of evolving laws and regulations relating to privacy and security, the scope of which is changing and subject to differing interpretations.\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (or the HITECH Act, which was enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009), and the implementing regulations issued under these statutes contain substantial restrictions and requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of individuals\u2019 protected health information. These restrictions and requirements are set forth in the Privacy Rule and Security Rule portions of HIPAA. The HIPAA Privacy Rule prohibits a covered entity from using or disclosing an individual\u2019s protected health information unless the use or disclosure is authorized by the individual or is specifically required or permitted under the Privacy Rule, and requires covered entities to provide individuals with certain rights with respect to their protected health information. The Privacy Rule imposes a complex system of requirements on covered entities for complying with these basic standards. Under the HIPAA Security Rule, covered entities must establish administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information maintained or transmitted by them or by others on their behalf.\nThe HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules historically have applied directly to covered entities, such as our members who are health care providers that engage in HIPAA-defined standard electronic transactions or health plans. Because some of our members disclose protected health information to us so that we may use that information to provide certain services to them, we are a \u201cbusiness associate\u201d of those members. To provide members with services that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information, the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules require us to enter into business associate agreements with our members. Such agreements must, among other matters, provide adequate written assurances:\n\u2022\nas to how we will use and disclose the protected health information;\n\u2022\nthat we will implement reasonable administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect such information from misuse;\n\u2022\nthat we will enter into similar agreements with our agents and subcontractors that have access to the information;\n\u2022\nthat we will report security incidents and other inappropriate uses or disclosures of the information; and\n\u2022\nthat we will assist the covered entity with certain of its duties under the Privacy Rule.\nOn January 25, 2013, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights, published a final rule modifying the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Enforcement, and Breach Notification Rules, referred to as the Final HIPAA Omnibus Rule, that implemented many of the provisions of the HITECH Act. Under the Final HIPAA Omnibus Rule, the privacy and security requirements of HIPAA were modified and expanded. The Final HIPAA Omnibus Rule applies certain of the HIPAA privacy and security requirements directly to business associates of covered entities. We must directly comply with certain aspects of the Privacy and Security Rules, and are also subject to enforcement for a violation of HIPAA. The Final HIPAA Omnibus Rule also imposes mandatory federal requirements for both covered entities and business associates regarding notification of breaches of unsecured protected health information.\nAny failure or perception of failure of our products or services to meet HIPAA and related regulatory requirements could expose us to risks of investigation, notification, litigation, penalty, or enforcement, could adversely affect demand for our products and services, and force us to expend significant capital and other resources to modify our products or services to address the privacy and security requirements of our members and HIPAA.\nIn addition to our obligations under HIPAA, most states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical information, and many states have adopted or are considering adopting further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards, and data security breach notification requirements. We may be required to comply with these state laws, if they are more stringent than HIPAA requirements and therefore not preempted by the federal requirements.\nWe are unable to predict what changes to HIPAA or other federal or state laws or regulations might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business, products, services, or the associated costs of compliance.\nFederal or state governmental authorities may impose additional data security standards or additional privacy or other restrictions on the collection, use, transmission, and other disclosures of health information that would limit, forbid, or regulate the use or transmission of health information pertaining to U.S. patients outside of the United States. Such legislation, if adopted, could render operations outside of the United States impracticable or substantially more expensive. In addition, although most of our business is conducted in the United States, some of our businesses and operations are international in nature and consequently are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we conduct those operations. We may be obligated to comply with these regulatory regimes, which include, among other matters, privacy and data protection regulations (including requirements for cross-border data transfers) that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\nOur higher education industry members are required to comply with The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA, and if we violate obligations relating to such members\u2019 FERPA compliance, our reputation and business could suffer.\nFERPA generally prohibits an institution of higher education from disclosing personally identifiable information from a student\u2019s education records without the student\u2019s consent. Our members disclose to us certain information that originates from or constitutes a student education record under FERPA and must make such disclosures to us in compliance with FERPA. As an entity that provides services to institutions, we are indirectly subject to FERPA and may not transfer or otherwise disclose any personally identifiable information from a student record to another party other than in a manner permitted under the statute. Any violation of us by FERPA could result in a material breach of contract with one or more of our members and could harm our reputation. Further, if we disclose student information in violation of FERPA, the Department of Education could require one or more members to suspend our access to student information for an extended period.\nIf we or our subcontractors or agents cause a violation of the Higher Education Act and corresponding regulations established by the Department of Education as they relate to the ban on incentive compensation, we could be liable to our members for substantial fines, sanctions, or other liabilities.\nMany of our higher education members are subject to the ban on incentive compensation established under the Higher Education Act and corresponding regulations established by the Department of Education. Such institutions are prohibited from providing any incentive payments based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any persons or \u201centities\u201d engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the award of student financial assistance. Such entities would include us to the extent that we are engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities, or in making decisions regarding financial aid, for a member. Moreover, the ban on incentive compensation extends to incentive payments, based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid, to the employees of such entities if the employees are involved with or responsible for admissions, recruiting, or financial aid activities. If we or our subcontractors or agents act in a manner that causes a violation of the incentive compensation rule, we could be liable to our members for substantial fines, sanctions, or other liabilities, including liabilities related to \u201cwhistleblower\u201d claims under the federal False Claims Act. Any such claims, even if without merit, could require us to incur significant costs to defend the claim, distract management\u2019s attention from our operations, and damage our reputation.\nIf we or our subcontractors or agents act in a manner that causes a violation of the Department of Education\u2019s misrepresentation rule, or similar federal and state regulatory requirements, we could face fines, sanctions, and other liabilities.\nMany of our higher education members are subject to other regulations promulgated by the Department of Education that affect our student recruitment activities, including the misrepresentation rule. The misrepresentation rule is broad in scope and may apply to certain statements our employees, subcontractors, or agents may make on behalf of or at the direction of a higher education member about the nature of a member\u2019s program, a member\u2019s financial charges, or the employability of graduates of a member\u2019s program. A violation of this rule, or other federal or state regulations applicable to our activities, based on statements or conduct by us or by an employee, subcontractor, or agent performing services for members could negatively affect our reputation, result in the termination of member contracts, require us to pay the fees associated with indemnifying a member from private claims or government investigations, or require us to pay substantial fines, sanctions, or other liabilities.\nIf our products or services fail to provide accurate information, or if our content or any other element of our products or services is associated with incorrect, inaccurate, or faulty coding, billing, or claims submissions to Medicare or any other third-party payor, we could be liable for damages to customers or the government.\nOur products and content were developed based on the laws, regulations, and third-party payor rules in existence at the time such software and content was developed. Members could assert claims against us or the government, or qui tam relators on behalf of the government could assert claims against us under the federal False Claims Act or similar state laws, if we interpret those laws, regulations, or rules incorrectly; the laws, regulations, or rules materially change at any point after the software and content was developed; we fail to provide up-to-date, accurate information; or our products or services are otherwise associated with incorrect, inaccurate, or faulty coding, billing, or claims submissions by our members. The assertion of such claims and ensuing litigation, regardless of the resolution, could result in substantial costs to us, divert management\u2019s attention from operations, damage our reputation, and decrease market acceptance of our services. Although we attempt to limit by contract our liability to customers for damages, the allocations of responsibility and limitations of liability set forth in our contracts may not be enforceable or otherwise protect us from liability for damages. We cannot limit liability the government could seek to impose on us under the False Claims Act.\nIf we fail to comply with federal and state laws governing health care fraud and abuse or reimbursement, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties or loss of eligibility to participate in government health care programs.\nA number of federal and state laws, including physician self-referral laws, anti-kickback restrictions, and laws prohibiting the submission of false or fraudulent claims, apply to health care providers, physicians, and others that make, offer, seek, or receive referrals or payments for products or services that may be paid for through any federal or state health care program and, in some instances, private programs. These laws are complex and change rapidly and may be applied to our business in ways that we do not anticipate. Federal and state regulatory and law enforcement authorities recently have increased enforcement activities with respect to Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse regulations and other health care reimbursement laws and rules. From time to time, participants in the health care industry receive inquiries or subpoenas to produce documents in connection with government investigations. We could be required to expend significant time and resources to comply with these requests, and the attention of our management team could be diverted from operations by these efforts.\nThese laws and regulations may change rapidly, and it is frequently unclear how they apply to our business. Errors created by our proprietary applications or that relate to claims or cost report information or services that relate to relationships between our members and other health care providers, including physicians, may be determined or alleged to be in violation of these laws and regulations. Any failure of our proprietary applications or services, including consulting and management services, to comply with these laws and regulations could result in substantial civil or criminal liability and could, among other impacts, adversely affect demand for our services, invalidate all or portions of some of our contracts with our members, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, cause us to be disqualified from serving customers doing business with government payors, and give our members the right to terminate our contracts with them.\nWe could become subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration if functionality in one or more of the software applications we offer causes the software to be considered a medical device.\nThe overall framework of the laws and regulations administered by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, applies to all products that meet the definition of a \u201cmedical device.\u201d To the extent that functionality in one or more of the software products we currently or may in the future offer causes the software to be considered a medical device under existing FDA regulations or policies or under regulations and policies now under active consideration by the FDA, we, as a provider of application functionality, could be required, depending on the functionality, to:\n\u2022\nregister our company and list products with the FDA;\n\u2022\nnotify the FDA and demonstrate substantial equivalence to other products on the market before marketing our functionality;\n\u2022\nobtain FDA approval by demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of the regulated products prior to marketing; and\n\u2022\ncomply with various FDA regulations, including the agency\u2019s quality system regulation, medical device reporting regulations, corrections and removal reporting regulations, and post-market surveillance regulations.\nThe FDA can impose extensive requirements governing pre- and post-market conditions, such as service investigation and conditions relating to approval, labeling, and manufacturing. In addition, the FDA can impose extensive requirements governing development controls and quality assurance processes. Any application of FDA regulations to our business could adversely affect our financial results by increasing our operating costs, slowing our time to market for regulated software products, and making it uneconomical to offer some software products.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nOur revenue and results of operations may suffer if we are unable to attract new members, obtain renewals from existing members, or sell additional products and services.\nWe derive most of our revenue from annual memberships for our programs, products, and services. Our growth therefore depends on our ability to attract prospects to their first membership, achieve and sustain high renewal rates on existing memberships, and sell additional products and services to existing members. This depends on our ability to understand and anticipate market and pricing trends and members\u2019 needs, the continuity of our principal contacts at a member organization, our members\u2019 budgetary environment, and our ability to deliver consistent, reliable, high-quality, and timely products and services that are more desirable than those of our competition. Failure to achieve new member additions, to deliver acceptable member renewal rate levels, or to cross-sell additional memberships and services to existing members at the level we forecast could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we are unable to maintain our reputation and expand our name recognition, we may have difficulty attracting new business and retaining current members.\nOur professional reputation is an important factor in attracting and retaining our members and in building relationships with the progressive health care and education organizations that supply many of the best practices we feature in our research. We believe that establishing and maintaining a good reputation and name recognition are critical for attracting and retaining members. Promotion and enhancement of our reputation will depend largely on our success in continuing to provide effective solutions. Our brand name and reputation will suffer, and our ability to attract new members or retain existing members could be adversely affected, if members do not perceive our solutions to be effective or of high quality or if there are inaccuracies or defects in our solutions.\nIf we are not able to offer new and valuable products and services, our business may suffer.\nOur success depends on our ability to identify and develop new products and services that serve specific constituencies, to anticipate changing market trends, and to adapt our research, software applications, and analysis to meet the changing needs of our members. We may not be able to provide helpful and timely research and analysis of developments and trends in a manner that meets market needs. Any such failure could cause some of our existing products and services to become obsolete, particularly in the health care industry, where needs continue to evolve rapidly with the introduction of new technology and the obsolescence of old technology, changing payment systems and regulatory requirements, shifting strategies and market positions of major industry participants, and changing objectives and expectations of health care consumers. This environment of rapid and continuous change presents significant challenges to our ability to provide our members with timely research, software applications, and consulting and management services for issues and topics of importance. As a result, we must continue to invest resources in development of new programs and services in order to enhance our existing products and services and introduce new high-quality products and services that will appeal to members and potential members.\nMany of our member relationships are non-exclusive or terminable after a specified term. If our new or modified product and service innovations are not responsive to user preferences or emerging industry standards or regulatory changes, are not appropriately timed with market opportunity, or are not effectively brought to market, we may lose existing members, be unable to obtain new members, or incur impairment of capitalized software development assets.\nBecause many of our programs offer a standardized set of services that allows us to spread our largely fixed program cost structure across our membership base of participating organizations, we may lose money on or terminate a program if we are unable to attract or retain a sufficient number of members in that program to cover our costs. Terminating a program could adversely affect our business by causing dissatisfaction among members of the terminated program and by impairing our reputation with current and potential members.\nCompetition may adversely affect our business.\nAny failure by us adequately to identify, understand, or address competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business. We compete in discrete programs and for discretionary dollars against health care-focused, education-focused, and multi-industry firms. These include traditional consulting firms; market research, data, benchmarking and forecasting providers; technology vendors and services firms; health care and education information technology firms; technology advisory firms; and specialized providers of educational and training services. Other entities, such as state and national trade associations, group purchasing organizations, non-profit think-tanks, and database companies, also may offer research, consulting, data- and tech-enabled services, and education services to health care and education organizations that are competitive with our programs.\nWe compete on the basis of several factors, including breadth, depth, and quality of product and service offerings, ability to deliver clinical, financial, and operational performance improvement through the use of products and services, quality and\nreliability of services, ease of use and convenience, brand recognition, and the ability to integrate services with existing technology. Some of our competitors are more established, benefit from greater name recognition, have larger member bases, and have substantially greater financial, technical, and marketing resources. Other of our competitors have proprietary technology that differentiates their product and service offerings from ours. As a result of these competitive advantages, our competitors and potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly to market forces, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns for their brands, products, and services, and make more attractive offers to our members.\nWe also compete on the basis of price. We may be subject to pricing pressures as a result of, among other factors, competition within the industry, consolidation of health care industry participants, practices of managed care organizations, government action affecting reimbursement, government action affecting access to student loans, and financial stress experienced by our members. If our pricing experiences significant downward pressure, our business will be less profitable and our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to retain our current members or expand our member base in this competitive environment. If we do not retain current members or expand our member base, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be harmed. Moreover, we expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation in both the health care information technology and health care industries. If one or more of our competitors or potential competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape also could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur prospects will suffer if we are not able to hire, train, motivate, manage, and retain a significant number of highly skilled employees.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to hire, train, motivate, manage, and retain a significant number of highly skilled employees, particularly research analysts, technical experts, and sales and marketing staff. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, competition for professional personnel from management consulting firms and other producers of research, technology, and analysis services. Hiring, training, motivating, managing, and retaining employees with the skills we need is time consuming and expensive. Any failure by us to address our staffing needs in an effective manner could hinder our ability to continue to provide high-quality products and services, implement software applications, complete existing member engagements, or attract new members.\nUnsuccessful design or implementation of our software may harm our future financial results.\nSoftware development and implementation can take long periods of time and require significant capital investments. If our software applications are less effective, cost-efficient, or attractive to our members than they anticipate or do not function as expected or designed, we may not recover the development costs, and our competitive position, operations, or financial results could be adversely affected. In addition, any defects in our software applications or other intellectual property could result in additional development costs, the diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts, significant cost to resolve the defect, loss of members, harm to our reputation, risk of nonpayment, loss of revenue, and exposure to liability claims. We also rely on technology and implementation support provided by others in certain of our programs that offer software applications. Our business could be harmed by defects in this technology or by the failure of third parties to provide timely and accurate services.\nSome of our products and services are complex and require significant work to implement. If the member implementation process is not executed successfully or if execution is delayed, our relationships with some of our members may be adversely impacted, and our results of operations may be negatively affected. In addition, cancellation of any of our products and services after implementation has begun may involve loss to us of time, effort, and resources invested in the canceled implementation as well as lost opportunity for acquiring other members over the same period.\nWe may experience significant delays in generating, or an inability to generate, revenue if potential members take a long time to evaluate our products and services.\nA key element of our strategy is to market our products and services directly to health care providers, such as health systems and acute care hospitals, and education institutions, such as colleges and research universities, to increase the number of our products and services utilized by existing members. If we are unable to sell additional products and services to existing hospital, health system, and education members, or enter into and maintain favorable relationships with other health care providers or education organizations, our ability to increase our revenue could be materially adversely affected. We do not control many of the factors that will influence the decisions of these organizations regarding the purchase of our products and services. The evaluation process sometimes can be lengthy and involve significant technical evaluation and commitment of personnel by these organizations. The use of our products and services also may be delayed due to reluctance to change or modify existing procedures.\nUnsuccessful delivery of our consulting and management services may harm our future financial success.\nWe provide strategic and operational support to our member institutions to help them achieve key clinical quality and financial performance goals, as well as to accelerate the implementation of best practices profiled in our research studies and to perform some services that they otherwise may perform themselves. If we do not deliver our services appropriately or timely, our relationships with some of our members and our results of operations may be negatively affected. To maintain our annual revenue and contract value from our consulting and management services, we will have to sell new consulting and management engagements each year as we complete other consulting and management engagements. We may not be successful in selling consulting and management engagements in the future as a result of a lack of continued market acceptance of our offerings or other factors. We also are subject to litigation for any failure to provide our services appropriately or in a timely manner.\nWe could sustain a material loss of business, substantial legal liability, and significant harm to our reputation as a result of an actual or attempted breach of security, unauthorized disclosure of information, denial of service attack, or the perception that personal or other sensitive or confidential information in our possession is not secure.\nWe receive, collect, process, and use a large amount of data and information from our employees and from or on behalf of our members and prospective members and other third parties in the course of our operations, including personally identifiable, protected health, and other sensitive and confidential information. This data is often accessed by us and our members through transmissions over public and private networks, including the Internet. The secure transmission of such information over the Internet and other mechanisms is essential to maintain confidence in our information technology systems. We have implemented security measures, technical controls, and contractual precautions designed to identify, detect, and prevent unauthorized access, alteration, use, or disclosure of our and our clients' and employees' data. However, there is no guarantee that these measures can provide absolute security. Beyond external criminal activity, systems that access or control access to our services and databases may be compromised as a result of human error, fraud, or malice on the part of employees or third parties, or may result from accidental technological failure. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable service, or sabotage systems change frequently, may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, and generally are not recognized until launched against us, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nIf someone is able to circumvent or breach our security systems, they could misappropriate information or cause interruptions to our operations. Successful or attempted security breaches also could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of monetary loss, litigation, fines, and sanctions. We also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties that conduct business with us or our members and others who interact with our data. While we maintain insurance against loss for certain security and privacy breaches, we may not carry appropriate insurance or maintain sufficient coverage to compensate for all potential liability.\nThe costs to us to eliminate or address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after an incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential members that may impede our critical functions. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our members or other third parties could expose us, our members, or other third parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business. In addition, we rely in certain limited capacities on third-party data management providers whose possible security problems and security vulnerabilities may have similar effects on us.\nOur business could be harmed by disruptions in service or operational failures at our data centers or at other service provider locations related to the storage, transmission, and presentation of member data.\nOur data centers and service provider locations store and transmit critical member data that is essential to our business. While these locations are chosen for their stability, failover capabilities, and system controls, we do not directly control the continued or uninterrupted availability of every location. Interruptions in service or damage to locations may be caused by natural disasters, power loss, Internet or network failures, operator error, security breaches, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, or similar events, and could result in service interruptions, delays in access, or the destruction of data. Disaster recovery, data backups, and business continuity planning address many of these possible service interruptions, but the varied types and severity of the interruptions that could occur may render our safeguards inadequate. These service interruption events could impair our ability to deliver services or products or cause us to miss specified service levels in our agreements with our members, which could negatively affect our ability to retain existing members and attract new members.\nWe may be liable to our members and may lose members if we are unable to collect and maintain member data or if we lose member data.\nBecause of the large amount of data that we collect and manage from our members and other third parties and the increasing use of technology in our programs, hardware failures or errors in our processes or systems could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our members regard as significant. Further, our ability to collect and report data may be interrupted or limited by a number of factors, including the failure of our network, software systems, or software applications, or the terms of our members\u2019 contracts with their third-party suppliers. Computer viruses may harm our systems, causing us to lose data, and the transmission of computer viruses could expose us to litigation. In addition to potential liability, if we supply inaccurate information or experience interruptions in our ability to capture, store, supply, utilize, and report information, our reputation could be harmed and we could lose existing members and experience difficulties in attracting new members.\nFailure by our members to obtain proper permissions and waivers for use and disclosure of the information we receive from them or on their behalf may result in claims against us or may limit or prevent our use of data, which could harm our business.\nWe require our members to provide necessary notices and to obtain necessary permissions and waivers for use and disclosure of the information that we receive, and we require contractual assurances from our members that they have done so and will do so. If our members do not obtain necessary permissions and waivers, our use and disclosure of information that we receive from them or on their behalf may be limited or prohibited by state or federal privacy laws or other laws. Any such failure to obtain proper permissions and waivers could impair our functions, processes, and databases that reflect, contain, or are based on such data and may prevent our use of such data. In addition, such a failure could interfere with or prevent creation or use of rules and analyses or limit other data-driven activities that benefit us. Moreover, we may be subject to claims or liability for use or disclosure of information by reason of our lack of a valid notice, permission, or waiver. These claims or liabilities could subject us to unexpected costs and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur sources of data might restrict our use of or refuse to license us such data, which could adversely affect our ability to provide certain products or services.\nA portion of the data that we use is purchased, licensed, or otherwise obtained from third parties, including from our members, government entities, and public records. We believe that we currently have the rights necessary to use the data that are incorporated into our products and services, although our licenses for information may not allow us to use that information for all potential or contemplated applications and products. These third parties could seek to withdraw their data from us for any reason, including if there is a competitive reason to do so, if legislation is passed restricting the use of the data, or if judicial or regulatory interpretations are issued restricting use of the data, and they also could fail to adhere to our data quality standards, causing us to incur additional expense to utilize the data appropriately. If a substantial number or data providers were to withdraw or restrict their data, or if they fail to adhere to our quality control standards, and if we are unable to identify and contract with suitable alternative data suppliers and integrate these data sources into our service offerings, our ability to provide products and services to our members could be materially adversely impacted, and it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to maintain our third-party providers or strategic alliances, or enter into new alliances, we may be unable to expand our current business.\nOur business strategy includes entering into strategic alliances and affiliations with leading service providers. If existing alliances are terminated or we are unable to enter into alliances with such providers, we may be unable to maintain or increase our market presence. We work closely with our strategic partners either to expand our penetration in certain areas or to expand our market capabilities. We may not achieve our objectives through these alliances. Many of these companies have multiple relationships and they may not regard us as significant to their business. Moreover, these companies, in certain circumstances, may pursue relationships with our competitors or develop or acquire products and services that compete with our products and services.\nOur business could be harmed if we are no longer able to license, integrate, or access third-party technologies and data.\nWe depend upon licenses from third-party vendors for some of the technology and data used in our software applications, for some of the technology platforms upon which these applications operate. We also use third-party software to maintain and enhance content generation and delivery, and to support our technology infrastructure. These technologies might not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Most of these licenses can be renewed only by mutual agreement and may be terminated if we breach the terms of the license and fail to cure the breach within a specified period. Our inability to obtain any of these licenses could delay our ability to provide services until alternative technology can be identified, licensed, and integrated, which may harm our financial condition and results of operations. Some of our third-\nparty licenses are non-exclusive, and our competitors may obtain the right to use any of the technology covered by these licenses to compete directly with us.\nOur use of third-party technologies exposes us to increased risks, including risks associated with the integration of new technology into our solutions, the diversion of our resources from development of our own proprietary technology, and the generation of revenue from licensed technology sufficient to offset associated procurement and maintenance costs. In addition, if our vendors choose to discontinue support of the licensed technology in the future, we might not be able to modify or adapt our own solutions to operate as effectively without this technology.\nIn addition, we need to access a member\u2019s information technology systems, some of which are provided to our members by third parties, in order to extract some of the member\u2019s data for certain of our software applications or otherwise to provide some of our consulting and management services to the member. Some of those third parties may limit, condition, or otherwise deny us access to those systems for any reason, including if there is a competitive reason to do so. Our inability to obtain timely access to a member\u2019s system on reasonable terms may increase the cost to deliver such services to our members and may adversely affect our ability to serve or retain existing members, gain new members, or continue to provide certain services.\nPotential liability claims may adversely affect our business.\nOur services, which may include recommendations and advice to organizations regarding complex business and operational processes, regulatory and compliance issues, and labor practices, may give rise to liability claims by our members or by third parties who bring claims against our members. Health care and education organizations often are the subject of regulatory scrutiny and litigation, and we also may become the subject of such litigation based on our advice and services. Any such litigation, whether or not resulting in a judgment against us, may adversely affect our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may not have adequate insurance coverage for claims against us.\nIf the protection of our intellectual property is inadequate, our competitors may gain access to our intellectual property and we may lose our competitive advantage.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of internal controls, contractual arrangements, and legal protections to protect our proprietary rights in our products and services. The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to deter misappropriation of our rights and may not enable us to detect unauthorized uses and take timely and effective steps to enforce our rights. Our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we lose our competitive advantage because others are able to use our intellectual property. If unauthorized uses of our proprietary products and services were to occur, we may be required to engage in costly and time-consuming litigation to enforce our rights, and we might not prevail in any such litigation. If others were able to use our intellectual property, our ability to charge our fees for our products and services could be adversely affected. In addition, we may be subject to infringement claims as we become more well-known to non-operating entities, sometimes referred to as patent trolls, or to competitors, that assert patents against other entities.\nIf we are alleged to infringe, misappropriate, or violate the proprietary rights of third parties, we could incur unanticipated expense and be prevented from providing our products and services.\nWe could be subject to intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, or other intellectual property violation claims to the extent that our research content and applications\u2019 functionality may overlap with competitive products, and third parties may claim that we do not own or have rights to use all intellectual property rights used in the conduct of our business. We cannot assure you that infringement, misappropriation, or claims alleging intellectual property violations will not be asserted against us. Also, we cannot assure you that any such claims will be unsuccessful. We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources defending any such claims. Further, a party making a claim against us could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide products or services. Licenses for any intellectual property of third parties that might be required for our products or services may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Such claims also might require us to indemnify of our members at significant expense.\nA number of our contracts with our members contain indemnity provisions in which we indemnify such members against certain losses that may arise from third-party claims that are brought in connection with the use of our products.\nOur exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of our acquisitions of technology, as we have limited information about the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks. In addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.\nOur use of open source technology could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our software applications and subject us to possible litigation.\nThe products or technologies acquired, licensed, or developed by us may incorporate so-called \u201copen source\u201d software, and we may incorporate open source software into other products in the future. Such open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under various public domain or other open source licenses. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to disclose publicly all or part of the source code to such software or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. There is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of many of the terms of these licenses and therefore the potential impact of such terms on our business is unknown and may result in unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our software applications.\nIf an author or other party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such allegations. If our defenses were not successful, we could be subject to significant damages, be enjoined from the distribution of our products that contained the open source software, and be required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of some of our products. In addition, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could be required under some open source licenses to release the source code of our proprietary software, which could substantially help our competitors develop products that are similar to or better than ours.\nWe make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIn connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors. Our most critical accounting estimates are described in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in this report. In addition, as discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 included elsewhere in this report, we make certain estimates, including decisions related to provisions for uncollectible revenue, income taxes, and other contingencies. While we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, they are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If any of these estimates and assumptions should change or prove to have been incorrect, our reported operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nAny significant increase in bad debt in excess of recorded estimates would have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur operations may incur unexpected losses from unforeseen exposures to member credit risk. We initially evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a number of factors, including a specific member\u2019s ability to meet its financial obligations to us, the length of time the receivables are past due, and historical collections experience. Based on these assessments, we record a reserve for specific account balances as well as a general reserve based on our historical experience for bad debt to reduce the related receivables to the amount we expect to collect from members. If circumstances related to specific members change as a result of economic conditions or otherwise, such as a limited ability to meet financial obligations due to bankruptcy, or if conditions deteriorate to the extent that our past collection experience is no longer relevant, the amount of accounts receivable that we are able to collect may be less than our previous estimates as we experience bad debt in excess of reserves previously recorded.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of Royall.\nOur future success will depend in part on our ability to realize the new revenue opportunities and other benefits that we expect to achieve from the integration of the businesses of Royall Acquisition Co., referred to as \u201cRoyall,\u201d into our company. Our operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected if we are unable to integrate successfully Royall\u2019s operations into our own, fail to achieve new revenue opportunities, incur unforeseen costs and expenses, or experience unexpected operating difficulties that offset anticipated benefits. In particular, the integration of our and the Royall businesses will involve, among other matters, integration of sales, marketing, billing, accounting, management, personnel, payroll, and other systems.\nWe are continuing to integrate the operations of Royall and other acquisitions into our business, and we may be unable to do so in the manner expected.\nOur ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of Royall and other acquisitions continue to be subject to a number of uncertainties. The integration process, which is continuing in 2016, could result in brand confusion, reduced employee morale and engagement, the disruption of our businesses, processes, and systems, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, and policies, and a significant burden on our management and internal resources, any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated the benefits of the acquisition as and when expected, or at all.\nFailure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenue and efficiencies from the Royall and other smaller acquisitions and could adversely affect our operating results and future growth\nWe may pursue other acquisition opportunities, which could subject us to considerable business and financial risk.\nWe evaluate potential acquisitions of complementary businesses on an ongoing basis and may from time to time pursue acquisition opportunities. We may not be successful in identifying acquisition opportunities, assessing the value, strengths, and weaknesses of these opportunities, or completing acquisitions on acceptable terms. Future acquisitions may result in dilution to our earnings, including as a result of dilutive issuances of equity securities we may pay as acquisition consideration. Acquisitions may expose us to particular business and financial risks, including risks that we may:\n\u2022\nsuffer the diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;\n\u2022\nincur indebtedness and assume additional liabilities, known and unknown, including liabilities relating to the use of intellectual property we acquire;\n\u2022\nincur significant additional capital expenditures, transaction expenses, operating expenses, and non-recurring acquisition-related and integration charges;\n\u2022\nexperience an adverse impact on our earnings from the amortization or impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets;\n\u2022\nfail to integrate successfully the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nenter new markets or market new products with which we are not entirely familiar; and\n\u2022\nfail to retain key personnel of, vendors to, and clients of the acquired businesses.\nIf we are unable to manage the risks associated with acquisitions, or if we experience unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, or delays frequently encountered in connection with the integration of acquired entities and the expansion of operations, we may fail to achieve expected cost savings, revenue opportunities, and other expected benefits of our acquisition strategy and may be required to focus resources on integrating the acquired operations rather than on our primary product and service offerings.\nGoodwill impairment charges may adversely affect our operating results.\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price over the net amount of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination measured at fair value. We have a substantial amount of goodwill on our balance sheet generated in connection with our acquisitions and business growth strategy. As of December 31, 2015, our goodwill of approximately $738.2 million represented approximately 37.3% of our total assets as of that date. We test the goodwill balances allocated to our reporting units for impairment on an annual basis and if events occur or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of one or more of our reporting units may be below its carrying amount. A decline in the quoted market price of our stock could denote a triggering event indicating that goodwill may be impaired. When testing goodwill for impairment, we determine fair value using both an income and market approach. The income approach is based on the present value of expected future cash flows utilizing a market-based weighted average cost of capital, or \u201cWACC.\u201d The market approach is based on revenue and earnings multiple data of peer companies. Given that market prices of our reporting units are not readily available, we make various estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of the reporting units, including estimating revenue growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, tax rates, terminal growth rates, discount rate, benefits associated with a taxable transaction, and synergistic benefits available to market participants. We also perform a reconciliation between our market capitalization and our estimate of the aggregate fair value of the reporting units, including consideration of a control premium. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to inherent uncertainties and changes in the estimates and assumptions described above.\nIn connection with our annual goodwill assessment on October 1, 2015, management reduced its cash flow projections for Royall due in part to first year performance being below the expectations we had set as of the acquisition date. Based on the results of the impairment test, we recorded an impairment charge of 15.3% of Royall\u2019s goodwill. For information about this $99.1 million impairment charge, see Note 8, \u201cGoodwill and intangibles,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nContinued lower than expected revenue growth, a trend of weaker than anticipated financial performance, including the pace and extent of operating margin, a decline in our share price from current levels for a sustained period of time, or an increase in the market-based WACC, among other factors, could significantly impact our impairment analysis and may result in further goodwill impairment charges that, if incurred, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For additional information, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Summary of Critical Accounting Policies - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\u201d\nWe may invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments.\nFrom time to time, we may make investments in companies to further their strategic objectives and support our key business initiatives. Such investments could include equity or debt instruments in private companies, many of which may be not be marketable at the time of our initial investment. These companies may range from early-stage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models. The success of these companies may depend on product development, market acceptance, operational efficiency, and other key business factors. The companies in which we invest may fail because they may not be able to secure additional funding, obtain favorable investment terms for future financings, or take advantage of liquidity events such as public offerings, mergers, and private sales. If any of these private companies fails, we could lose all or part of our investment in that company. If we determine that impairment indicators exist and that there are other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of the investments, we may be required to write down the investments to their fair value and recognize the related write-down as an investment loss.\nIf our members who operate as not-for profit entities lose their tax-exempt status, those members would suffer significant adverse tax consequences which, in turn, could adversely affect their ability to purchase products or services from us.\nState tax authorities have challenged the tax-exempt status of hospitals and other health care facilities claiming such status on the basis that they are operating as charitable or religious organizations. The outcome of these cases has been mixed, with some facilities retaining their tax-exempt status and others being denied the ability to continue operating as not-for profit, tax-exempt entities under state law. In addition, many states have removed sales tax exemptions previously available to not-for-profit entities, and both the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Congress are investigating the practices of non-for profit hospitals. Those facilities denied tax exemptions could be subject to the imposition of tax penalties and assessments that could have a material adverse impact on their cash flow, financial strength, and, in some cases, continuing viability. If the tax-exempt status of any of our members is revoked or compromised by new legislation or interpretation of existing legislation, that member\u2019s financial health could be adversely affected, which could negatively affect our sales to the member.\nOur growing operations in India expose us to risks that could have an adverse effect on our costs of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 250 employees in India through our Indian subsidiary, ABCO Advisory Services India Private Ltd., which expects to continue adding personnel. While there are cost advantages to operating in India, significant growth in the technology sector in India has increased competition to attract and retain skilled employees and has led to a commensurate increase in compensation expense. In the future, we may not be able to hire and retain such personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure in India. In addition, our reliance on a workforce in India exposes us to disruptions in the business, political, and economic environment in that region. Maintenance of a stable political environment is important to our operations, and terrorist attacks and acts of violence or war may directly affect our physical facilities and workforce or contribute to general instability. Our operations in India require us to comply with complex local laws and regulatory requirements and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our Indian operations also may subject us to trade restrictions, reduced or inadequate protection for intellectual property rights, and security breaches. Negative developments in any of these areas could increase our costs of operations or otherwise harm our business.\nIf we are required to collect sales and use taxes on the programs we sell in various jurisdictions, we may be subject to liability for past sales and incur additional related costs and expenses and may experience a decrease in our future sales.\nWe may lose sales or incur significant expenses if states are successful in imposing state sales and use taxes on our services. A successful assertion by one or more states that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, decrease our ability to compete with software vendors not subject to sales and use taxes, and otherwise harm our business. Each state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. We review these rules and regulations periodically and, when we believe that our services are subject to sales and use taxes in a particular state, may approach state tax authorities to determine how to comply with their rules and regulations. We may become subject to sales and use taxes and related interest and penalties for past sales in states where we believe no compliance is necessary. If we are required to collect and pay back taxes and the associated interest and penalties, and if our members fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts, we will incur unplanned expenses that may be substantial. Moreover, imposition of such taxes on our future services will effectively increase the cost of such services to our members and may adversely affect our ability to retain existing clients or to gain new members in the states in which such taxes are imposed.\nWe may not be able to fully realize our deferred tax assets.\nFor tax purposes, we have deferred income tax assets consisting primarily of state income tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards. As of December 31, 2015, our deferred income tax assets totaled approximately $49.6 million, which\nconstituted approximately 2.5% of our total assets as of that date. If our future taxable income is less than we believe it will be, we may not be able to fully realize our deferred tax assets. In estimating future tax consequences, we do not consider the effect of future changes in existing tax laws or rates in the determination and evaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities until the new tax laws or rates are enacted. We have established our deferred income tax assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax laws and rates, including the estimated effects of our status as a Qualified High Technology Company on our Washington, D.C. deferred tax assets. We will recognize an adjustment to income for the impact of new tax laws or rates on the existing deferred tax assets and liabilities when and if new tax laws or rates are enacted that have an impact on our deferred income taxes.\nChanges in, or interpretations of, tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective tax rates.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and several foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our provision for income taxes. We also are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional tax against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation, or the effects of a change in tax policy in the United States or in any of the international jurisdictions where we do business, could have a material effect on our operating results in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nAs a result of the inherent limitations in our internal control over financial reporting, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file with or submit to the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the \u201cExchange Act,\u201d is accumulated and communicated to management and recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. In addition, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by an unauthorized override of the controls.\nAny failure by us to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe are required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and to include a report by our independent auditors attesting to such effectiveness. Any failure by us to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our ability to report accurately our financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent auditors determine that we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, also could restrict our future access to the capital markets. As discussed in this report under \u201cControls and Procedures,\u201d our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, we had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to our revenue recognition and business combination processes.\nOur issuance of additional capital stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plans, or otherwise could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur charter authorizes us to issue up to 135,000,000 shares of common stock and up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors. Subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations and our debt covenants, we may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment, our stock incentive plans, or otherwise. We may issue additional shares of common stock at a discount from the market price of our common stock on the issue date. Any issuance of stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nProvisions in our charter and bylaws could discourage takeover attempts we oppose even if our stockholders might benefit from a change in control of our company.\nProvisions in our charter and bylaws may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a takeover attempt we oppose even if a change in control of our company would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders. These provisions also could make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you support. The charter and bylaw provisions:\n\u2022\nprovide that the number of directors that will constitute the entire board of directors will be determined by a resolution of a majority of the board;\n\u2022\nprovide that any vacancy on the board of directors may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office;\n\u2022\nprovide that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by a majority of the directors then in office, by the chairman of the board of directors, or by any holder or holders of at least 40% of the outstanding shares of capital stock then entitled to vote on any matter for which the special meeting is being called;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholders from taking action by written consent in lieu of a meeting with respect to any actions that are required or permitted to be taken by stockholders at any annual or special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide authority for our board of directors without stockholder approval to provide for the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more classes or series, with terms and conditions, and having rights, privileges and preferences, to be determined by the board of directors; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice procedures for stockholders to make nominations of candidates for election as directors or to present any other business for consideration at any annual or special stockholder meeting.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur level of debt and interest payment obligations may limit our growth and operational flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $553.4 million in aggregate outstanding indebtedness, consisting of $453.4 million in borrowings under our senior secured term loan facility and $100 million in borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility. These facilities were obtained on February 6, 2015 and amended on October 31, 2015, as described elsewhere in this report. We may incur an additional $100 million of indebtedness under our senior secured revolving credit facility. This substantial level of indebtedness may have important consequences. For example, it may:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing to expand our business or alleviate liquidity constraints, as a result of financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to pursue our acquisition strategy;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies that have less indebtedness.\nCovenants under our senior secured credit agreement may restrict our future operations.\nOur senior secured credit agreement imposes operating and financial restrictions that limit our discretion on certain business matters, which could make it more difficult for us to expand, finance our operations, and engage in other business activities that may be in our interest. These restrictions include a requirement that we comply on a quarterly basis with financial covenants. Our debt covenants limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:\n\u2022\nincur indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on assets;\n\u2022\npay cash dividends;\n\u2022\nrepurchase shares of our common stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake investments in or loans to other parties;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions; and\n\u2022\nengage in businesses other than businesses of the type we conduct currently.\nWe may incur indebtedness in addition to the foregoing indebtedness. Any additional indebtedness we may incur in the future may subject us to similar or even more restrictive conditions.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk that could cause us to incur unanticipated costs.\nBorrowings under our senior secured credit agreement are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed would remain the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. We have entered into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility for a notional amount of $276.8 million at December 31, 2015. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. Additionally, hedging transactions involve additional risks such as counterparty risk, the legal enforceability of hedging contracts, the early repayment of hedged transactions, and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates may cause a significant loss of basis in the contract and a change in current period expense.\nIn the event that we need to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding debt before maturity or as it matures, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as the terms of our existing debt or refinance our existing debt at all. If interest rates or other factors existing at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, the interest expense relating to the refinanced debt would increase.\nHedging instruments often are not guaranteed by an exchange or its clearing house and involve risks and costs.\nHedging instruments involve risk since they are often not guaranteed by an exchange or a clearing house. The enforceability of agreements underlying derivative transactions may depend on compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and, depending on the identity of the counterparty, applicable international requirements. The business failure of a hedging counterparty with which we enter into a hedging transaction would most likely result in a default, which would result in the loss of unrealized gains and force us to cover our resale commitments, if any, at the then current market price. Although we generally seek to reserve the right to terminate our hedging positions, it may not always be possible to dispose of or close out a hedging position without the consent of the hedging counterparty, and we may not be able to enter into an offsetting contract to cover our risk. We cannot assure that a liquid secondary market will exist for hedging instruments purchased or sold, and we may be required to maintain a position until its expiration, which could result in losses.", "PERMNO": 89203, "SIC": 8742, "TIC": "ABCO"}
