{"cik": "899751", "company": "TITAN INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nThe Company is subject to various risks and uncertainties relating to or arising out of the nature of its business and general business, economic, financing, legal and other factors or conditions that may affect the Company. Realization of any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on Titan\u2019s business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe Company is exposed to price fluctuations of key commodities.\nThe Company does not generally enter into long-term commodity contracts and does not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge exposures to commodity market price fluctuations. Therefore, the Company is exposed to price fluctuations of key commodities, which consist primarily of steel and rubber. Although the Company attempts to pass on certain material price increases to its customers, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to do so in the future. Any increase in the price of steel and rubber that is not passed on to customers could have a material adverse effect on Titan\u2019s results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe Company relies on a limited number of suppliers.\nThe Company currently relies on a limited number of suppliers for certain key commodities, which consist primarily of steel and rubber, in the manufacturing of Titan products. The loss of key suppliers or their inability to meet price, quality, quantity and delivery requirements could have a significant adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s revolving credit facility and other debt obligations contain covenants.\nThe Company\u2019s revolving credit facility and other debt obligations contain covenants and restrictions. These covenants and restrictions could limit Titan\u2019s ability to respond to market conditions, to provide for unanticipated capital investments, to raise additional debt or equity capital, to pay dividends or to take advantage of business opportunities, including future acquisitions. Titan\u2019s ability to comply with the covenants may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions.\n\u2022\nThe Company operates in cyclical industries and is subject to numerous changes in the economy.\nThe Company's sales are substantially dependent on three major industries: agricultural equipment, earthmoving/construction equipment and consumer products. The business activity levels in these industries are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles. Any downturn in these industries or the general economy could have a material adverse effect on Titan\u2019s business.\nThe agricultural equipment industry is affected by crop prices, farm income and farmland values, weather, export markets and government policies. The earthmoving/construction industry is affected by the levels of government and private construction spending and replacement demand. The mining industry, which is within the earthmoving/construction industry, is affected by raw material commodity prices. The consumer products industry is affected by consumer disposable income, weather, competitive pricing, energy prices and consumer attitudes. In addition, the performance of these industries is sensitive to interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes and varies with the overall level of economic activity.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s customer base is relatively concentrated.\nThe Company\u2019s ten largest customers, which are primarily original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), accounted for 31% of Titan\u2019s net sales for 2015. Net sales to Deere & Company represented 10% of total 2015 net sales. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2015. As a result, Titan\u2019s business could be adversely affected if one of its larger customers reduces its purchases from Titan due to work stoppages or slow-downs, financial difficulties, as a result of termination provisions, competitive pricing or other reasons. There is also continuing pressure from the OEMs to reduce costs, including the cost of products and services purchased from outside suppliers such as Titan. The Company has had long-term relationships with major customers and expects to continue these relationships. There can be no assurance that Titan will be able to maintain such ongoing relationships. Any failure to maintain the Company\u2019s relationship with a leading customer could have an adverse effect on results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s revenues are seasonal in nature due to Titan\u2019s dependence on seasonal industries.\nThe agricultural, earthmoving/construction and recreational industries are seasonal, with typically lower sales during the second half of the year. This seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations in the Company\u2019s revenues and operating results. Because much of Titan\u2019s overhead expenses are fixed, seasonal trends can cause reductions in quarterly profit margins and financial condition, especially during slower periods.\n\u2022\nThe Company may be adversely affected by changes in government regulations and policies.\nDomestic and foreign political developments and government regulations and policies directly affect the agricultural, earthmoving/construction and consumer products industries in the United States and abroad. Regulations and policies in the agricultural industry include those encouraging farm acreage reduction in the United States and granting ethanol subsidies. Regulations and policies relating to the earthmoving/construction industry include the construction of roads, bridges and other items of infrastructure. The modification of existing laws, regulations or policies or the adoption of new laws, regulations or policies could have an adverse effect on any one or more of these industries and, therefore, on Titan\u2019s business.\n\u2022\nThe Company is subject to corporate governance requirements, and costs related to compliance with, or failure to comply with, existing and future requirements could adversely affect Titan\u2019s business.\nThe Company is subject to corporate governance requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as new rules and regulations subsequently adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). These laws, rules and regulations continue to evolve and may become increasingly restrictive in the future. Failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations may have an adverse material effect on Titan\u2019s reputation, financial condition and the value of the Company\u2019s securities.\n\u2022\nThe Company faces substantial competition from domestic and international companies.\nThe Company competes with several domestic and international competitors, some of which are larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than Titan. Titan competes primarily on the basis of price, quality, customer service, design capability and delivery time. The Company\u2019s ability to compete with international competitors may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations. In addition, certain OEM customers could elect to manufacture certain products to meet their own requirements or to otherwise compete with Titan.\nThere can be no assurance that Titan\u2019s businesses will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the Company\u2019s markets or that competitors will not develop products that are more effective or less expensive than Titan products or which could render certain products less competitive. From time to time certain competitors have reduced prices in particular product categories, which has caused Titan to reduce prices. There can be no assurance that in the future Titan\u2019s competitors will not further reduce prices or that any such reductions would not have a material adverse effect on Titan\u2019s business.\n\u2022\nThe Company may be affected by unfair trade.\nTitan faces intense competition from producers both in the United States and around the world. In early January 2016, Titan, along with the United Steel Workers, filed petitions with the U.S. Department of Commerce (\u201cDept. of Commerce\u201d) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (\u201cITC\u201d) alleging that imported off-the-road tires from India and Sri Lanka and wheel and tire assemblies from China were being dumped and/or subsidized and were a cause of material injury to the domestic industry. Both the Dept. of Commerce and the ITC have initiated investigations against India and Sri Lanka; but, the ITC did not recommend pursuing the investigation into wheel and tire assemblies from China. If the Dept. of Commerce determines that imports are a cause of material injury (or threat of material injury) to the domestic industry and the Dept. of Commerce finds that imported goods are dumped and/or subsidized, imports will be subject to offsetting duties to neutralize such internationally recognized unfair trade practices. The investigations will likely run through early 2017, although preliminary relief could be provided during the summer of 2016.\nUnfair trade from other countries may have a material adverse effect on Titan's business.\n\u2022\nThe Company could be negatively impacted if Titan fails to maintain satisfactory labor relations.\nThe Company is party to collective bargaining agreements. Upon the expiration of any of the collective bargaining agreements, however, Titan may be unable to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements on terms that are cost effective to the Company. The business operations may be affected as a result of labor disputes or difficulties and delays in the process of renegotiating collective bargaining agreements.\n\u2022\nUnfavorable outcomes of legal proceedings could adversely affect results of operations.\nThe Company is a party to routine legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions or the range of possible loss, the Company believes at this time that none of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. However, due to the difficult nature of predicting unresolved and future legal claims, the Company cannot anticipate or predict any material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows as a result of efforts to comply with, or its liabilities pertaining to, legal judgments.\n\u2022\nAcquisitions may require significant resources and/or result in significant losses, costs or liabilities.\nAny future acquisitions will depend on the ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, to negotiate acceptable terms for their acquisition and to finance those acquisitions. Titan will also face competition for suitable acquisition candidates that may increase costs. In addition, acquisitions require significant managerial attention, which may be diverted from current operations. Furthermore, acquisitions of businesses or facilities entail a number of additional risks, including:\n- problems with effective integration of operations;\n- the inability to maintain key pre-acquisition customer, supplier and employee relationships;\n- the potential that expected benefits or synergies are not realized and operating costs increase; and\n- exposure to unanticipated liabilities.\nInternational acquisitions may be more complex and time consuming. Also, international acquisitions may include a number of additional risks including the integration of acquisitions operating under differing laws and regulations.\nSubject to the terms of indebtedness, the Company may finance future acquisitions with cash from operations, additional indebtedness and/or by issuing additional equity securities. These commitments may impair the operation of Titan\u2019s businesses. In addition, the Company could face financial risks associated with incurring additional indebtedness such as reducing liquidity and access to financing markets and increasing the amount of cash flow required to service such indebtedness.\n\u2022\nThe Company has international operations and purchases raw material from foreign suppliers.\nThe Company had total aggregate sales outside the United States of approximately $750.2 million, $1,028.0 million and $1,089.9 million, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Sales outside the United States have become a significant proportion of total sales, accounting for 54%, 54% and 50% for the years ending December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Sales from these international operations are expected to continue to represent a similar portion of total sales.\nInternational Operations and Sales - International operations and sales are subject to a number of special risks, including, but not limited to, risks with respect to currency exchange rates, economic and political destabilization, other disruption of markets and restrictive actions by foreign governments (such as restrictions on transfer of funds, export duties and quotas and foreign customs). Other risks include changes in foreign laws regarding trade and investment; difficulties in obtaining distribution and support; nationalization; reforms of United States laws and policies affecting trade, foreign investment and loans; and foreign tax laws. There may also be restrictions on the Company's ability to repatriate earnings and investments from international operations. There can be no assurance that one or a combination of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to increase or maintain its foreign sales.\nForeign Suppliers - The Company purchases raw materials from foreign suppliers. The production costs, profit margins and competitive position of the Company are affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where Titan purchases goods, relative to the strength of the currencies in countries where the products are sold. The Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial position may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies.\n\u2022\nThe Company is subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations.\nThe Company has international operations and must comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA prohibits these payments regardless of local customs and practices. Although Titan has a compliance program in place to reduce the potential violations of corruption laws, violations of these laws could adversely affect the Company's business.\n\u2022\nThe Company may be subject to product liability and warranty claims.\nThe Company warrants its products to be free of certain defects and, accordingly, may be subject to product liability or product warranty claims in the ordinary course of business. Losses may result or be alleged to result from defects in Titan products, which could subject the Company to claims for damages, including consequential damages. There can be no assurance that Company insurance will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that adequate insurance will be available on terms acceptable to the Company. Any claims relating to defective products that result in liability exceeding Titan\u2019s insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations. Further, claims of defects could result in negative publicity against Titan, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\n\u2022\nThe Company has incurred, and may incur in the future, net losses.\nThe Company reported loss before income taxes of $52.0 million and $152.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and may incur losses in the future. Although the Company reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2013, and the Company expects to generate future profitability, there is no guarantee the Company will be profitable in the future.\n\u2022\nThe Company may be adversely affected by a disruption in, or failure of, information technology systems.\nThe Company relies upon information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information. Technology systems are used in a variety of business processes and activities, including purchasing, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and financial reporting. The Company utilizes security measures and business continuity plans to prevent, detect and remediate damage from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, utility failures and other similar disruptions. Despite these measures, a security breach or information technology system failure may disrupt and adversely affect the Company's operations.\n\u2022\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with climate change and climate change regulations.\nGovernmental regulatory bodies in the United States and other countries have, or are, contemplating introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change. Laws and regulations regarding climate change and energy usage may impact the Company directly through higher costs for energy and raw materials. The Company\u2019s customers may also be affected by climate change regulations that may impact future purchases. Physical climate change may potentially have a large impact on the Company\u2019s two largest industry segments, agriculture and earthmoving/construction. The potential impacts of climate change and climate change regulations are highly uncertain at this time, and the Company cannot anticipate or predict the material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows as a result of climate change and climate change regulations.\n\u2022\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with environmental laws and regulations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and other materials. The Company\u2019s operations entail risks in these areas, and there can be no assurance that Titan will not incur material costs or liabilities. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and safety laws, regulations or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future.\n\u2022\nThe Company may incur additional tax expense or tax exposure.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, and has domestic and international tax liabilities which are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. Titan's income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations.\n\u2022\nThe Company is subject to foreign currency translation risk.\nThe Company continues to expand globally and now operates in many worldwide locations and transacts business in many foreign currencies. Titan's financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars with financial statements of international subsidiaries being initially recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. dollars. Large fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other world currencies may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\n\u2022\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with uncertainties related to social, political and economic conditions in Russia and Brazil.\nGeopolitical and economic uncertainties relating to Russia and Brazil have and could continue to have a negative impact on the Company's sales and results of operations at the Company's Russian and Brazilian operations.\n\u2022\nThe Company has identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting which resulted in a restatement of its financial statements which, if not remediated, could result in additional material mistatements in the Company's financial statements.\nTitan\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As disclosed in Item 9A, management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to entity level controls. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of this material weakness, management concluded that Titan's internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - An Integrated Framework. Management is actively engaged in developing a remediation plan designed to address this material weakness. If the remediation measures are insufficient to address the material weakness or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in Titan's internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, the Company's consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and Titan could be required to restate financial results.", "PERMNO": 79198, "SIC": 3523, "TIC": "TWI"}
