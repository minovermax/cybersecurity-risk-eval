RISK FACTORS\nOur results of operations and financial condition can be adversely affected by numerous risks and uncertainties. In evaluating the Company, the risks and uncertainties described below and the matters described in \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d should be considered carefully. Should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition, and future prospects could be negatively impacted.\nOur sales and operating results are affected by consumer sensitivity to economic conditions. The retail apparel business is dependent upon consumer spending and, as a fashion retailer, we rely on the expenditure of discretionary income for most, if not all, of our sales. Economic factors impacting consumer confidence and levels of consumer spending include levels of employment, the housing market, the stock market, prevailing interest rates, tax policies, personal bankruptcies, energy costs and availability and cost of credit. Consumer confidence is also affected by both domestic and international events. Deterioration in the level of consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe face intense competition in the retail industry. We face intense competition for customers from department stores, specialty stores, regional and national off-price retail chains and Internet and mail-order retailers. Many of these competitors are larger and have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do. In addition, many department stores and other competitors have become more promotional and have reduced their price points. Certain department stores and certain of our vendors have opened outlet stores which offer merchandise at prices that are competitive with ours. Many of our competitors have significant Internet sales. While we maintain an Internet site, our Internet sales currently comprise less than 1% of our total sales. If we fail to successfully compete, our profitability and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nUnanticipated changes in fashion trends and changing consumer preferences may adversely affect our sales. Our success depends in part upon our ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and fashion trends in a timely manner. Although we attempt to stay abreast of the fashion tastes of our customers and provide merchandise that satisfies customer demand, fashion trends can change rapidly and we may not accurately anticipate shifts in fashion trends and adjust our merchandise mix to appeal to changing consumer tastes in a timely manner. If we misjudge the market for our products or are unsuccessful in responding to changes in fashion trends or in market demand, we could experience insufficient inventory levels and missed opportunities, or excess inventory levels and higher markdowns, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur advertising, marketing and promotional strategies may be ineffective. Our profitability and results of operations may be materially affected by the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing expenditures and our ability to select the right markets and media in which to advertise. In particular, we may not be successful in our efforts to create greater awareness of our stores and promotions, identify the most effective and efficient level of spending in each market and specific media vehicle and determine the appropriate creative message and media mix for our advertising, marketing and promotional expenditures. While we utilize different types of media, newspapers are an important delivery vehicle for run of press promotional advertising and circular insertions. The newspaper business is under increasing economic pressure, and the demise of certain newspapers would jeopardize an important distribution method for our advertising. As readers shift away from newspapers, our success will depend more on our effective use of other forms of media for our advertising, marketing and promotional strategies. Our planned marketing expenditures may not result in increased revenues.\nWe may be unable to raise additional capital, if needed, or to raise capital on favorable terms. If our existing cash, cash generated from operations and funds available under our revolving credit agreement were insufficient to fund our future operations, including capital expenditures, or repay debt when it becomes due, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. If unfavorable capital or credit market conditions exist if and when we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms or on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to obtain capital on acceptable terms when required could have a material adverse effect on our business including an inability to fund new growth and other capital expenditures, especially in light of the debt we recently incurred to fund our special cash dividend of $5.00 per share on our outstanding shares of common stock.\nWe may be unable to negotiate acceptable lease terms with current and potential landlords. Our growth and success depends in part on our ability to renew and enter into new leases for successful stores. There is no assurance that we will be able to re-negotiate leases at similar or satisfactory terms at the end of the lease, and we could be forced to move or exit trade areas if another favorable arrangement cannot be made. There is also no assurance that we will be able to negotiate satisfactory terms on new or replacement stores.\nWe may not be able to exit under-performing stores on acceptable terms. As part of our strategy, we close certain under-performing stores, generally based on the lack of store profitability. Such closures subject us to costs, including lease termination payments and the write-down of leasehold improvements, equipment, furniture, fixtures and inventory. For early terminations, we may remain liable for future lease obligations which could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.\nBecause of our focus on keeping our inventory at the forefront of fashion trends, extreme and/or unseasonable weather conditions could force us to have higher inventory markdowns. Our business is susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions. For example, extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the fall season or cool weather during the spring season could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions. Prolonged unseasonable weather conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period might make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA lack of adequate sources of merchandise at acceptable prices may adversely affect our sales. Our business is dependent to a significant degree upon our ability to purchase fashion and brand name merchandise, and to do so at acceptable wholesale prices. We continuously seek out buying opportunities and compete for these opportunities with other retailers. In the event of a further decrease in retail sales and the resulting pressure on manufacturers, the opportunities to purchase merchandise could become limited by the consolidation or demise of merchandise vendors. Our ability to obtain merchandise may also depend on manufacturers\u2019 ability to obtain vendor financing through banks and factoring companies. To the extent they are unable to secure sufficient credit, they may not be able to sell to us at acceptable terms. Although we do not depend on any single vendor or group of vendors and believe we can successfully compete in seeking out new vendors, the loss of key vendors could make it difficult for us to acquire sufficient quantities and an appropriate mix of merchandise, and to do so at acceptable prices which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIncreases in the price of merchandise could increase our costs which could negatively impact our margins. The raw materials used to manufacture our goods are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by high demand for fabrics, supply conditions, government regulations, and other unpredictable factors. Our procurement of goods and services is subject to the effects of price increases which we may or may not be able to pass through to our customers. Additionally, procurement of our merchandise is subject to increases in demand for, or the price of, raw materials, services and labor. All of these factors may affect our ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms, are beyond our control and could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on certain key personnel and our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and increases in the cost of employee compensation and benefits could impact our financial results and cash flows. Our business is dependent on attracting and retaining quality employees. Many of our employees are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our labor costs, including hourly wages and costs of providing retirement, health and other employee benefits, and hiring and training new employees is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs, including health care legislation.\nThe seasonality of our business and fluctuations in sales and operating results could cause volatility in the price of our common stock. Our business is seasonal with our highest sales occurring in the first and fourth quarters, which include the spring and holiday seasons. Our annual operating results depend significantly upon sales generated during these quarters, and any factor that negatively impacts these selling seasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the entire year. Comparable store sales and quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. Our stock price is influenced by these financial fluctuations, as well as other factors, including economic conditions, timing of promotional events, actions of competitors, inventory management, changes in fashion trends and unseasonable weather conditions.\nIf we experience any business interruptions or disruptions in the distribution process, our profitability could be materially impacted. We may not anticipate, respond adequately to or control all of the challenges of operating our distribution operations. In the event that the orderly receipt and distribution of merchandise is disrupted, including by labor disputes at ports of entry, impeding the timeliness or fulfillment quality of the products being distributed, or any of our distribution centers becomes inaccessible, or is otherwise not fully usable, it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to distribute our products, which in turn would have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, financial condition and operating performance.\nWe are subject to risks associated with importing merchandise from other countries. Much of the fashion and brand name merchandise we acquire, either directly or through vendors, is sourced from various foreign countries. Political or financial instability, terrorism, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, raw material shortages, disruptions, strikes, work stoppages and other factors beyond our control could affect the availability of our merchandise inventory. Additionally, while our internal policies require our vendors and the third parties from whom they source merchandise to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, we do not have the ability to control our vendors, their manufacturers or their employment and business practices. The failure of our vendors and their suppliers to comply with applicable laws, or the use of labor practices which deviate from those which generally are considered ethical in the United States, could affect the availability and price of merchandise, damage our reputation or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, financial condition and operating performance.\nFailure of information technology could disrupt operations and harm our business. The operation of our business and the effective execution of our merchandising and distribution strategies as well as our financial reporting processes are dependent in large measure on the effectiveness of our information technology systems. The reliability and capacity of our information technology systems are critical and any disruptions affecting our information technology systems may have a material adverse impact on our business.\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer or employee information could severely damage our reputation, expose us to risks of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and harm our business. As part of our normal course of business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential customer and employee information and we process customer credit card and check information. In addition, we accept and transmit credit card applications through our retail locations. We also rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential\ninformation. The systems we utilize for credit card transactions, as well as the technology utilized in such transactions, are determined and controlled by the credit card industry. Recent breaches of security measures at major retailers have resulted in the theft and dissemination of the confidential information of millions of customers throughout the United States. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, whether by us or our service providers, could severely damage our reputation, expose us to risks of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and harm our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on a single supplier for shoes sold by our shoe department and disruptions with that supplier could materially affect our reputation, operations or financial results. We have an agreement with DSW to be the exclusive supplier of shoes sold in our shoe departments. We rely on DSW to determine the quantity and mix of shoes to be sold, the prices at which such items are to be sold and the fulfillment and continuing supply of inventory. If DSW was unable to provide us with sufficient amounts of inventory or inventory that meets the fashion preferences of our customers or if DSW was unable to continue being our supplier of shoes, we may attract fewer customers and experience a loss in net sales, which could materially affect our reputation, operations or financial results.\nWe have engaged a single third-party provider to create, operate and maintain our e-commerce website operations, and disruptions with the provider or in the services it provides to us could adversely affect our reputation, operations or financial results. We have contracted with a single third party to create, operate and host our e-commerce website and provide related order fulfillment and customer service. We will rely on that party\u2019s operational, privacy and security procedures and controls to operate and host our e-commerce business. Failure by such third party to adequately service these aspects of our e-commerce business could result in a prolonged disruption that affects our customers\u2019 ability to utilize our website or receive product in a timely manner. As a result, we may lose customer sales and/or experience increased costs, which could affect our reputation, operations or financial results. In addition, the e-commerce operations also involve other risks that could have an impact on our results of operations including but not limited to diversion of sales from our physical stores, liability for online content, credit card fraud and risks related to the failure of the computer systems that operate the website and its related support systems, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nActs or threats of terrorism, violence or unfavorable political conditions could harm our business. Acts of terrorism or war may disrupt commerce and undermine consumer confidence, which could negatively impact our sales revenue by causing consumer spending to decline. Also, an act of terrorism or war, or the threat thereof, could negatively impact our business by interfering with our ability to obtain merchandise from vendors. Inability to obtain merchandise from our vendors or substitute suppliers at similar costs in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements may adversely impact our business and results of operations. Our business is subject to many legal and regulatory requirements, including, among others, employment, trade, healthcare, tax, securities and privacy laws and regulations. Our policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to help us comply with all applicable laws; however, the current high level of regulatory reform across many different areas and jurisdictions has led, and may continue to lead, to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations. Additional legal or regulatory requirements or more stringent interpretations of applicable requirements could increase the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the cost of compliance. Failure to comply with the various laws and regulations, as well as changes in laws and regulations, could have an adverse impact on our reputation, operations or financial results.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) Investigation could materially and adversely affect our business, our financial condition and results of operations. On July 24, 2013, the SEC informed the Company that it was conducting an investigation of the Company and made a request for voluntary production of documents and information. Based upon the request, the Company believes the investigation is focused on the Company\u2019s restatement of 2012 and prior financial statements and the Company\u2019s 2013 change in auditors. The Company is cooperating fully with the SEC in this matter. A protracted investigation could impose substantial costs and distractions, regardless of its outcome. There can be no assurance that any final resolution of this investigation will not have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nWe previously identified and have now remediated material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which may, if our remediation measures are insufficient, result in additional material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In prior fiscal years, our management identified certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We believe all such material weaknesses have been fully addressed by the remediation measures put in place during the 2013 and 2014 fiscal years. However, if our remediation measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results.", "PERMNO": 77530, "SIC": 5651, "TIC": "SMRTQ"}
