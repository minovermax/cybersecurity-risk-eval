In addition to the matters described above under \u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Information,\u201d set forth below are some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause a material adverse change in our results of operations or financial condition. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or not presently deemed material by us also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\nContinued economic uncertainty could negatively affect our sales and earnings.\nOverall demand for our products depends upon consumer demand for furniture and bedding, which is subject to variations in the general economy. Because purchases of furniture or bedding are discretionary purchases for most individuals and businesses, demand for these products is sometimes more easily influenced by economic trends than demand for other products. Economic downturns can affect consumer spending habits and demand for home furnishings, which reduces the demand for our products and therefore can cause a decrease in our sales and earnings. Economic uncertainty has caused a decrease in consumer spending and demand for home furnishings, including goods that incorporate our products. If these conditions persist, our business will be negatively affected.\nIt has been challenging to maintain and increase sales levels in the upholstery fabrics segment.\nIncreased competition and fragmentation of the upholstery fabrics business, including a dramatic shift to imported fabrics and resulting price deflation for upholstery fabrics, have led to a significant reduction in the size of our upholstery business. Opportunities for growth and profitability gains for this segment are encouraging, but there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain or consistently grow this business in the future.\nGreater reliance on offshore operations and foreign sources of products or raw materials increases the likelihood of disruptions to our supply chain or our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis.\nWe rely significantly on operations in distant locations, especially China, and in addition we have been purchasing a significant share of our products and raw materials from offshore sources, particularly Asia and Turkey. At the same time, our domestic manufacturing capacity for the upholstery fabrics segment has been greatly reduced. These changes have caused us to rely on a much longer supply chain and on a larger number of suppliers that we do not control, both of which are inherently subject to greater risks of delay or disruption. In addition, operations and sourcing in foreign areas are subject to the risk of changing local governmental rules, taxes, changes in import rules or customs, tariffs, potential political unrest, or other threats that could disrupt or increase the costs of operating in foreign areas or sourcing products overseas. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies can affect our financial results because a significant portion of our operations are located outside the United States. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies can have a negative impact on our sales of products produced in those countries. Any of the risks associated with foreign operations and sources could cause unanticipated increases in operating costs or disruptions in business, which could negatively impact our ultimate financial results.\nOur business faces several risks associated with doing business in China\nWe source a variety of fabrics from a limited number of strategic suppliers in China, and we operate five upholstery manufacturing facilities in Shanghai, China. The Chinese economy is characterized by extensive state ownership, control, and regulation. Therefore, our business is continually subject to the risk of changes in Chinese laws and regulations that could have an adverse effect on our suppliers and manufacturing operations. Any changes in policies governing tariffs, imports and exports, taxation, inflation, environmental regulations, foreign currency exchange rates, the labor market, property, and financial regulations could have an adverse effect on our business. Further, the Chinese legal system is continuing to develop and evolve, and the enforcement of rules and regulations is not always consistent or uniform. Moreover, any potential civil unrest, natural disasters, or other threats could disrupt or increase the costs of operating in China. The Chinese economy poses additional risks to our business, including fluctuating rates of inflation and currency exchange rates, a declining labor force participation rate, and rising employee wages. In addition, changes in the political climate or trade policy of the United States, such as increased duties or tariffs on Chinese imports, may adversely affect our business. Any of the risks associated with our Chinese operations and sources could cause unanticipated increases in operating costs or disruptions in business, which could negatively impact our ultimate financial results.\nWe may have difficulty managing the outsourcing arrangements being used for products and services.\nWe rely on outside sources for various products and services, including yarn and other raw materials, greige (unfinished) fabrics, finished fabrics, and services such as weaving and finishing. Increased reliance on outsourcing lowers our capital investment and fixed costs, but it decreases the amount of control that we have over certain elements of our production capacity. Interruptions in our ability to obtain raw materials or other required products or services from our outside suppliers on a timely and cost effective basis, especially if alternative suppliers cannot be immediately obtained, could disrupt our production and damage our financial results.\nWrite-offs or write-downs of assets would result in a decrease in our earnings and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nThe company has long-lived assets, primarily consisting of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, and to a lesser extent other intangible assets. ASC Topic 360 establishes an impairment accounting model for long-lived assets such as property, plant, and equipment and requires the company to assess for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered. ASC Topic 350 requires that goodwill and other intangible assets be tested at least annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered.\nAlthough no material write-downs were experienced in the past several fiscal years, we recently announced the closure of our Anderson, SC upholstery fabrics facility during the first quarter fiscal 2019. Currently, management estimates that the fair market value of our property, plant, and equipment exceeds its carrying value by approximately $400,000, and for this reason, no charge for impairment is expected to be recorded in connection with this decision. However, we are currently working with our customers to fulfill any outstanding or future orders, and through this process, we will be able to determine a good faith estimate of any inventory write-downs.\nOur goodwill has increased during fiscal 2018 in connection with our acquisition of Read Window Products, LLC and is expected to increase further due our recent acquisition of eLuxury in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.\nThere is no assurance that future write-downs of fixed assets, goodwill, or other intangible assets will not occur if business conditions were to deteriorate.\nChanges in the price, availability, and quality of raw materials could increase our costs or cause production delays and sales interruptions, which would result in decreased earnings.\nWe depend upon outside suppliers for most of our raw material needs, and we rely upon outside suppliers for component materials such as yarn and unfinished fabrics, as well as for certain services such as finishing and weaving. Fluctuations in the price, availability, and quality of these goods and services could have a negative effect on our production costs and ability to meet the demands of our customers, which would affect our ability to generate sales and earnings. In many cases, we are not able to pass through increased costs of raw materials or increased production costs to our customers through price increases. In particular, many of our basic raw materials are petrochemical products or are produced from such products. For this reason, our material costs are especially sensitive to changes in prices for petrochemicals and the underlying price of oil. Increases in prices for oil, petrochemical products or other raw materials and services provided by outside suppliers can significantly increase our costs and negatively affect earnings. Late in fiscal 2018, we began to experience higher raw material prices and resulting impacts on our profits. A continuation of this trend would result in continuing downward pressure on our profit margins and earnings.\nIncreases in energy costs would increase our operating costs and could adversely affect earnings.\nHigher prices for electricity, natural gas, and fuel increase our production and shipping costs. A significant shortage, increased prices, or interruptions in the availability of these energy sources would increase the costs of producing and delivering products to our customers, and would be likely to adversely affect our earnings. In many cases, we are not able to pass along the full extent of increases in our production costs to customers through price increases. Energy costs have varied significantly during recent fiscal years, and remain a volatile element of our costs. Increases in energy costs could have a negative effect on our earnings.\nBusiness difficulties or failures of large customers could result in a decrease in our sales and earnings.\nWe currently have several customers that account for a substantial portion of our sales. In the mattress fabrics segment, several large bedding manufacturers have large market shares and comprise a significant portion of our mattress fabric sales, with Serta Simmons Holdings, LLC accounting for approximately 25% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2018. In the upholstery fabrics segment, La-Z-Boy Incorporated accounted for approximately 12% of consolidated net sales during fiscal 2018, and several other large furniture manufacturers comprised a significant portion of sales. A business failure or other significant financial difficulty by one or more of our major customers, or the loss of one or more of these customers, could cause a significant loss in sales, an adverse effect on our earnings, and difficulty in collection of our trade accounts receivable.\nLoss of market share due to competition would result in declines in sales and could result in losses or decreases in earnings.\nOur business is highly competitive, and we face significant competition from a large number of competitors, both foreign and domestic. We compete with many other manufacturers of fabric, as well as converters who source fabrics from various producers and market them to manufacturers of furniture and bedding. In many cases, these fabrics are sourced from foreign suppliers who have a lower cost structure than the company. The highly competitive nature of our business in both segments means we are constantly subject to the risk of losing market share. As a result of increased competition, there have been deflationary pressures on the prices for many of our products, which make it more difficult to pass along increased operating costs such as raw materials, energy or labor in the form of price increases and puts downward pressure on our profit margins. Also, the wide range of product offerings in our business can make it more difficult to differentiate our products through design, styling, finish, and other techniques.\nIf we fail to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer tastes and fashion trends, our sales and earnings may decline.\nDemand for various types of upholstery fabrics and mattress coverings changes over time due to fashion trends and changing consumer tastes for furniture and bedding. Our success in marketing our fabrics depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to fashion trends in home furnishings. If we fail to identify and respond to these changes, our sales of these products may decline. In addition, incorrect projections about the demand for certain products could cause the accumulation of excess raw material or finished goods inventory, which could lead to inventory mark-downs and decreases in earnings.\nIncreasing dependence on information technology systems comes with specific risks, including cybersecurity breaches and data leaks, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe increasingly rely on technology systems and infrastructure. In fiscal 2018, we launched a new platform for direct sales to retailers of bedding accessory products, and in fiscal 2019 we acquired a majority interest in an e-commerce retailer of bedding accessories and other home goods. Greater dependence on technology systems and e-commerce heightens the risk of potential vulnerabilities from system failure and malfunction, breakdowns due to natural disasters, human error, unauthorized access, power loss, and other unforeseen events. Data privacy breaches by employees and others with or without authorized access to our systems poses risks that sensitive data may be permanently lost or leaked to the public or other unauthorized persons. With the growing use and rapid evolution of technology, including internet selling, cloud-based computing and mobile devices, there are additional risks of unintentional data leaks. There is also the risk of our exposure to theft of confidential information, intentional vandalism, industrial espionage, and a variety of cyber-attacks that could compromise our internal technology system, infrastructure, or result in data leakage in-house or at our third-party providers and business partners. Failures of technology or related systems, or an improper release of confidential information, could damage our business or subject us to unexpected liabilities.\nWe are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact our sales and earnings.\nWe have been, and in the future may be, a party to legal proceedings and claims, including environmental matters, product liability, and employment disputes, some of which claim significant damages. We face the continual business risk of exposure to claims that our operations have caused personal injury or property damage. We maintain insurance against product liability claims and in some cases have indemnification agreements with regard to environmental claims, but there can be no assurance that these arrangements will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that such arrangements will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that claims against the company will not have a material adverse impact on our earnings or financial condition. We are also subject to various laws and regulations in our business, including those relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment. We could incur substantial costs as a result of noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws or other regulations.\nWe must comply with a number of governmental regulations applicable to our business, and changes in those regulations could adversely affect our business.\nOur products and raw materials are and will continue to be subject to regulation in the United States by various federal, state, and local regulatory authorities. In addition, other governments and agencies in other jurisdictions regulate the manufacture, sale, and distribution of our products and raw materials. Also, rules and restrictions regarding the importation of fabrics and other materials, including custom duties, tariffs, quotas and other regulations, are continually changing. Environmental laws, labor laws, tax regulations, and other regulations continually affect our business. All of these rules and regulations can and do change from time to time, which can increase our costs or require us to make changes in our manufacturing processes, product mix, sources of products and raw materials, or distribution. Changes in the rules and regulations applicable to our business may negatively impact our sales and earnings.", "PERMNO": 27909, "SIC": 2211, "TIC": "CULP"}
