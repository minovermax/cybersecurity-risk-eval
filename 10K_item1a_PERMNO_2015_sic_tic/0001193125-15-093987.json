{"cik": "1308208", "company": "Universal Truckload Services, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS\nWe rely extensively on owner-operators to provide transportation services to our customers. Continued reliance on owner-operators, as well as reductions in our pool of available driver candidates, could limit our growth.\nThe transportation services that we provide are frequently carried out by owner-operators who are generally responsible for paying for their own equipment, fuel and other operating costs. In addition, our owner-operators provide a substantial portion of the tractors used in our business. Owner-operators make up a relatively small\nportion of the pool of all truck drivers. Thus, continued reliance primarily on owner-operators could limit our ability to grow. In addition, the following factors recently have combined to create a difficult operating environment for owner-operators:\n\u2022\nincreases in the prices of new and used tractors;\n\u2022\na tightening of financing sources available to owner-operators for the acquisition of equipment;\n\u2022\nhigh fuel prices;\n\u2022\nincreases in insurance costs; and\n\u2022\neffects of some states and trade unions to classify owner-operators as employees.\nIn recent years, these factors have caused many owner-operators to join company-owned fleets or to exit the industry entirely. As a result of the smaller available pool of qualified owner-operators, the already strong competition among carriers for their services has intensified. Due to the difficult operating environment and intense competition, turnover among owner-operators in the trucking industry is high. Additionally, our agreements with our owner-operators are terminable by either party upon short notice and without penalty. Consequently, we regularly need to recruit qualified owner-operators to replace those who have left our fleet. If we are unable to retain our existing owner-operators or recruit new owner-operators, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn the event that the current operating environment for owner-operators worsens, we could adjust our owner-operator compensation package or, alternatively, acquire more of our own revenue equipment and seat it with employee drivers in order to maintain or increase the size of our fleet. The adoption of either of these measures could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If we are required to increase the compensation of owner-operators, our results of operations would be adversely affected to the extent increased expenses are not offset by higher freight rates. If we elect to purchase more of our own tractors and hire additional employee drivers, our capital expenditures would increase, we would incur additional employee benefits costs, depreciation, interest, and/or equipment rental expenses. The financial return on our assets would decline and we would be exposed to the risks associated with implementing a different business model.\nWe rely heavily upon our agents to develop customer relationships and to locate freight, and the loss of any agent or agents responsible for a significant portion of our revenue could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nWe rely heavily upon our agents to market our transportation services, to act as intermediaries with customers and to recruit owner-operators. Although we employ a small field management staff that maintains direct relationships with some of our larger, national customers and is responsible for supporting, coordinating and supervising our agent\u2019s activities, the primary relationship with our customers generally is with our agents and not directly with us. We rely on verbal agreements with many of our agents and these verbal agreements do not obligate our agents to provide us with a specific amount of service or to refer freight exclusively to us. Our reliance on verbal agreements may increase the likelihood that we or our agents have a disagreement or a misunderstanding of our and their respective rights and obligations. In addition, in the event of a dispute with one of our agents, we may not be able to verify the terms of the agreement.\nWe compete with other trucking companies that utilize agent networks both to recruit quality agents and for the business that they generate, which typically involves both competition with respect to the freight rates that we charge shippers and the compensation paid to the agents. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our agents or that our agents will continue to refer to us the amount of business that they have in the past. If we were to lose the service of an agent or agents responsible for a significant portion of our operating revenues or if any such agent or agents were to significantly reduce the volume of business that they refer to us, it would have a materially adverse effect on our operating revenues and results of operations. Further, if we were required to increase the compensation we pay to agents in order to retain or maintain business volumes with them, our\noperating results would be adversely affected to the extent that we could not pass these increased costs on to our customers.\nWe rely on subcontractors or suppliers to perform their contractual obligations.\nSome of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of their work or to customer concerns about a subcontractor. Failure by our subcontractors to perform the agreed-upon services or to provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations. A delay in our ability to obtain components and equipment parts from our suppliers may affect our ability to meet our customers\u2019 needs, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe self-insure for a significant portion of our potential liability for auto liability, workers\u2019 compensation and general liability claims. One or more significant claims, our failure to adequately reserve for such claims, or the cost of maintaining our insurance, could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe maintain workers compensation and general liability insurance with licensed insurance carriers. We also maintain auto liability insurance up to a limit of $1,000,000 per occurrence unless riders are sought to satisfy individual customer or vendor contract requirements. We are self-insured for claims in excess of these limits and for all cargo, material handling and equipment damage claims.\nThe nature of our industry is that auto accidents occur and, when they do, they almost always result in equipment damage and they often result in injuries or death. If we experience claims that are not covered by our insurance or that exceed our reserves, or if we experience claims for which coverage is not provided, it could increase the volatility of our earnings and have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect our insurance and claims expense will continue to increase over historical levels, even if we do not experience an increase in the number of insurance claims. Insurance carriers have significantly raised premiums for many businesses, including trucking companies. If we decide to increase our insurance coverage in the future, our costs would be expected to further increase. A significant increase in insurance costs could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur current or future levels of indebtedness and our debt service obligations could harm our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt.\nOn December 19, 2013, we entered into a second amendment to our secured credit agreement in connection with the acquisition of Westport USA Holding, LLC which allows borrowings totaling up to $300.0 million. At December 31, 2014, $235.3 million is borrowed under the credit agreement. As a result of our recent acquisitions, we are leveraged and have significant debt service obligations. Our expected level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of such indebtedness. In addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents that will be governing our indebtedness. If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase.\nOur debt could have other important consequences, which include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\na substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be required to pay principal and interest on our debt;\n\u2022\nour interest expense could increase if interest rates increase because the loans under our credit agreement would generally bear interest at floating rates;\n\u2022\nour leverage could increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions, placing us at a disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that are less leveraged;\n\u2022\nour debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in the commercial real estate services industry;\n\u2022\nour failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, results in foreclosure on substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nour level of debt may restrict us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and other general corporate requirements.\nWe cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations. If we do not have sufficient earnings, we may be required to seek to refinance all or part of our then existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or sell more securities, none of which we can guarantee that we will be able to do and which, if accomplished, may adversely affect us.\nOur business is subject to general economic and business factors that are largely out of our control, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur business is dependent upon a number of general economic and business factors that may have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. Many of these are beyond our control, including new equipment prices and used equipment values, interest rates, fuel taxes, tolls, and license and registration fees, all of which could increase the costs borne by our owner-operators, and capacity levels in the trucking industry, particularly in the industry segments and geographic regions in which we operate.\nWe also are affected by recessionary economic cycles, changes in inventory levels, and downturns in customers\u2019 business cycles, particularly in market segments and industries where we have a significant concentration of customers, such as automotive, steel and other metals, building materials and machinery. Economic conditions may adversely affect our customers, their need for our services, or their ability to pay for our services. Adverse changes in any of these factors could have a materially adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe operate in the highly competitive and fragmented transportation and logistics industry, and our business may suffer if we are unable to adequately address factors that may adversely affect our revenue and costs relative to our competitors.\nNumerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability. These factors include the following:\n\u2022\nwe compete with many other truckload carriers and logistics companies of varying sizes, some of which have more equipment, a broader coverage network, a wider range of services and greater capital resources than we do;\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors periodically reduce their rates to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase rates, maintain our operating margins or maintain significant growth in our business;\n\u2022\nmany customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting so-called \u201ccore carriers\u201d as approved service providers, and in some instances we may not be selected;\n\u2022\nsome companies hire lead logistics providers to manage their logistics operations, and these lead logistics providers may hire logistics providers on a non-neutral basis which may reduce the number of business opportunities available to us;\n\u2022\nmany customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers and providers for their shipping and logistic service needs, and this process may result in the loss of some of our business to competitors and/or price reductions;\n\u2022\nthe trend toward consolidation in the trucking and third-party logistics industries may create other large providers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size and with whom we may have difficulty competing;\n\u2022\nadvances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to accept higher rates to cover the cost of these investments;\n\u2022\ncompetition from Internet-based and other brokerage companies may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and freight rates;\n\u2022\neconomies of scale that may be passed on to smaller providers by procurement aggregation providers may improve the ability of smaller providers to compete with us;\n\u2022\nsome areas of our service coverage requires trucks with engines no older than 2010 in order to comply with environmental rules; and\n\u2022\nan inability to continue to access capital markets to finance equipment acquisition could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nAny decrease in demand for outsourced services in the industries we serve could reduce our revenue and seriously harm our business.\nOur growth strategy is partially based on the assumption that the trend towards outsourcing logistics services will continue despite potentially adverse economic trends affecting our customers. Declines in sales volumes in the industries we serve may lead to a declining demand for logistics services.\nProduction volumes of our customers are sensitive to consumer demand as well as employee and labor relations. Declines in sales volumes, or the expectation of declines, could result in production cutbacks and unplanned plant shutdowns. Likewise, potential customers may see a risk, based on labor relations issues or other factors, in relying on third-party logistics service providers or may define these activities as their own core competencies and may seek means to deploy excess labor or other resources, and hence may prefer to perform logistics operations themselves. We therefore cannot assure you that the market for logistics services will not decline or will grow as we expect.\nOther developments may also lead to a decline in the demand for our services by our customers. For example, consolidation or acquisitions, particularly involving our customers, may decrease the potential number of buyers of our services. Similarly, the relocation or expansion of our customers\u2019 production operations in locations where we do not have an established presence, or where our competitive position is not as strong, may adversely affect our business, even if production increases worldwide, if we are not able to effectively service these customers in such locations. Any significant reduction in or the elimination of the use of the services we provide would result in reduced revenue and harm our business.\nMany of our customers experience rapid changes in their prospects, substantial price competition and pressure on their profitability. Although such pressures can encourage outsourcing as a cost-reduction measure, they may also result in increasing pressure on us from our customers to lower our prices, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur profitability could be negatively impacted by downward pricing pressure from certain of our customers.\nGiven the nature of our services and the competitive environment in which we operate, our largest customers exert downward pricing pressure and often require modifications to our standard commercial terms. Due to their\nsize and market concentration, some of our customers utilize competitive bidding procedures involving bids from a number of competitors or otherwise exert pressure on our prices and margins. Likewise, such customers\u2019 increased bargaining power could have a negative effect on the non-monetary terms of our customer contracts, for example, in relation to the allocation of risk or the terms of payment. While we believe our ongoing cost reduction initiatives have helped mitigate the effect of price reduction pressures from our customers, there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our current levels of profitability.\nFluctuations in the price or availability of fuel and our ability to collect fuel surcharges may affect our ability to retain or recruit owner-operators.\nOur owner-operators bear the costs of operating their tractors, including the cost of fuel and fuel taxes. The tractors operated by our owner-operators consume large amounts of diesel fuel. Diesel fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to economic, political and other factors beyond our control. For example, average weekly diesel fuel prices ranged from $3.21 per gallon to $4.02 per gallon in 2014, compared with $3.82 per gallon to $4.16 per gallon in 2013. To address fluctuations in fuel prices, we seek to impose fuel surcharges on our customers and pass these surcharges on to our owner-operators. These arrangements will not fully protect our owner-operators from fuel price increases. If costs for fuel escalate significantly it could make it more difficult to attract additional qualified owner-operators and retain our current owner-operators. Our owner-operators also may seek higher compensation from us in the form of higher commissions, which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. If we lose the services of a significant number of owner-operators or are unable to attract additional owner-operators, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy, which could cause our business and future growth prospects to suffer.\nOne component of our growth strategy is to pursue strategic acquisitions of transportation companies and third-party providers of logistic services that meet our acquisition criteria. Our growth plans are highly dependent upon being able to make strategic acquisitions. However, suitable acquisition candidates may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable. In pursuing acquisitions, we compete with other companies, many of which may have greater resources than we do. If we are unable to secure sufficient funding for potential acquisitions, we may not be able to complete strategic acquisitions that we otherwise find desirable. Further, if we succeed in consummating strategic acquisitions, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected because:\n\u2022\nsome of the acquired businesses may not achieve anticipated revenues, earnings or cash flows;\n\u2022\nwe may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us or exceed our estimates;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational, and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems;\n\u2022\nacquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and divert our resources;\n\u2022\nwe may experience difficulties operating in markets in which we have had no or only limited direct experience;\n\u2022\nwe may lose the customers, key employees, agents and owner-operators of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nwe may finance future acquisitions by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price, which could dilute the ownership interests of our shareholders;\n\u2022\nwe may incur additional debt related to future acquisitions; or\n\u2022\nwe may acquire companies that derive a portion of their revenues from asset-based operations and experience unforeseen difficulties in integrating this business model.\nWe may not realize the expected benefits of the Westport Acquisition because of integration difficulties and other challenges.\nOn December 19, 2013, we acquired Westport in a transaction pursuant to which Westport became our wholly owned subsidiary (the \u201cWestport Acquisition\u201d). The success of the Westport Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate Westport\u2019s business with our existing businesses. The diversion of our management\u2019s attention from other operations and any difficulties encountered in combining operations could prevent us from realizing the full benefits anticipated to result from the Westport Acquisition and could adversely affect our business.\nIf we are unable to retain our executive officers, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe are highly dependent upon the services of our executive officers and the officers of our operating subsidiaries. We do not maintain key-man life insurance on any of these persons. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a materially adverse effect on our operations and future profitability. We also need to continue to develop and retain a core group of managers if we are to realize our goal of expanding our operations and continuing our growth. The market for qualified employees can be highly competitive, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain the services of qualified executives, managers or other employees.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with, liability for violation of, or changes in, existing or future regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our business and our ability to retain or recruit owner-operators.\nThe U.S. Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, or FMCSA, and various state and local agencies exercise broad powers over our business, generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety and insurance requirements. Our owner-operators must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the FMCSA, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours-of-service. There also are regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry, including testing and specifications of equipment and product handling requirements. These measures could disrupt or impede the timing of our deliveries and we may fail to meet the needs of our customers. The cost of complying with these regulatory measures, or any future measures, could have a materially adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nIn December 2011, the FMCSA published new final hours-of-service (HOS) rules, which they believe comply with a court imposed settlement agreement, allowing commercial motor carrier drivers to continue to drive up to 11 hours within a 14-hour workday and mandate at least 10 consecutive off-duty hours between workdays. The rule also allows drivers to continue to restart their calculations of weekly on-duty time limits after having at least 34 consecutive hours off-duty. We believe the FMCSA still favors a 10-hour driving limit, which would yield a loss of 1-hour of service from current standards, but they currently have insufficient research data to support such a change.\nIn December 2010, the FMCSA also initiated its Compliance Safety Accountability (CSA) initiative (formerly Comprehensive Safety Analysis 2010). The CSA system fundamentally changes the safety evaluation process for all motor carriers and includes a scope of enforcement to the driver/owner-operator level to make safety performance history more transparent to law enforcement and motor carriers. We believe the intent is to improve regulatory oversight of motor carriers and drivers. There is a rulemaking due to be published July 2015 that will proposed setting standards for rating motor carriers based on these CSA scores alone unlike the previous process that required an onsite audit to rate the motor carrier for continued operation.\nWe are also preparing for an anticipated change in the manner in which commercial drivers will be required to document their HOS. In April 2010, the FMCSA published a regulation that would require interstate carriers, with documented patterns of HOS violations, to install electronic on-board recorders (EOBR) in their vehicles.\nEOBRs are devices attached to a vehicle that automatically record the number of hours a driver spends operating the vehicle. The current system is a manual log system The FMCSA is working on a new proposed rulemaking to mandate the use of Electronic Log Devices (ELDs) in most motor vehicles governed by FMCSA regulations. This rulemaking is due to be published in November 2015, will allow for input from all transportation stakeholders and should have implementation projected for some time in 2017.\nAdditionally, a change in liability insurance requirements is being proposed from the current federal standard of $750,000 to a new standard of $2 million\nAdvocacy groups may continue to challenge the final rulings of the FMCSA, and we are unable to predict how a court may rule on such challenges. We will continue to monitor the actions of the FMCSA.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties.\nOur operations involve the risks of fuel spillage and environmental damage, among others, and we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations. If we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to criminal and civil liability, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results. In addition, claims for environmental liabilities arising out of property contamination have been asserted against us from time to time. Such claims, in some instances, have been associated with businesses related to entities or facilities we acquired and have been based on conduct that occurred prior to our acquisition of those entities or facilities. While none of the claims identified to date have resulted in a material liability to us, additional environmental liabilities relating to any of our former operations or any entities or facilities we have acquired could be identified and give rise to claims against us involving significant losses. In addition, compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations, such as those relating to carbon emissions and the effects of global warming, can be expected to have a significant impact on our transportation services and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA determination by regulators that our agents and owner-operators are employees could expose us to various liabilities and additional costs.\nFrom time to time, tax and other regulatory authorities have sought to assert that independent contractors in the transportation services industry, such as our agents and owner-operators, are employees rather than independent contractors. There can be no assurance that these interpretations and tax laws that consider these persons independent contractors will not change or that these authorities will not successfully assert this position. If our agents or owner-operators are determined to be our employees, that determination could materially increase our exposure under a variety of federal and state tax, workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment and tort laws, as well as our potential liability for employee benefits. Our business model relies on the fact that our agents and owner-operators are not deemed to be our employees, and exposure to any of the above increased costs would have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nOur business may be disrupted by natural disasters causing supply chain disruptions.\nNatural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and could damage or destroy infrastructure necessary to transport products as part of the supply chain. These events could make it difficult or impossible for us to provide logistics and transportation services, disrupt or prevent our ability to perform functions at the corporate level, and/or otherwise impede our ability to continue business operations in a continuous manner consistent with the level and extent of business activities prior to the occurrence of the unexpected event, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on access to transportation networks.\nWe do not maintain all of our own transportation networks, and we rely on other third-party transportation service providers for some of our logistics services. Access to competitive transportation networks is important to logistics companies such as ourselves. We cannot assure you that we will always be able to ensure access to preferred third-party networks or that these networks will continue to meet our needs and allow us to remain competitive, in particular as compared with our large competitors with their own affiliated networks. If we are unable to ensure sufficient access to the most competitive domestic and international networks on a long-term basis, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and net sales, and the related operating results and operating cash flows.\nOur business may be harmed by terrorist attacks, future war or anti-terrorism measures.\nFederal, state and municipal authorities continue to implement and follow various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. Such measures may have costs associated with them, which we or our owner-operators could be forced to bear, or may otherwise reduce the productivity of our owner-operators. For example, security measures imposed at bridges, tunnels, border crossings and other points on key trucking routes may cause delays and increase the non-driving time of our owner-operators, which could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results. Our international operations in Mexico, Canada and Colombia may be affected significantly if there are any disruptions or closures of border traffic due to security measures. In addition, war, risk of war or a terrorist attack also may have an adverse effect on the economy. A decline in economic activity could adversely affect our revenues or restrict our future growth. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war also could affect our ability to raise capital. In addition, the insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by us could increase dramatically or such coverage could be unavailable in the future.\nOur ability to grow may be affected if shippers refuse to use our services because we operate a portion of our business through agents and owner-operators.\nIn our experience, certain high-volume shippers have determined that their freight must be hauled by carriers that use company drivers and equipment. Such shippers believe that they can obtain a more homogenous fleet and more control over service standards. Such policies could prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities, which could adversely affect our growth and results of operations.\nOur intermodal business could be adversely affected by a decrease in the volume of international shipments.\nA portion of our business comes from the intermodal segment of the transportation market, and we believe that by expanding our intermodal support services we have a substantial opportunity to grow our business. A decrease in intermodal transportation services resulting from general economic conditions or other factors such as work stoppages, price competition from other modes of transportation, or a disruption in steamship or rail service could have an adverse effect on these growth opportunities and have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nCyclicality and seasonality in our business and the impact of weather could adversely affect our quarterly operating results.\nOur revenues and profitability are impacted by industrial demand. Most notably, our value-added services and dedicated transportation services, which comprise a significant component of our profitability, are somewhat dependent upon North American automotive sales and the vehicle production schedules of our customers. The automotive market and other industrial markets are cyclical and depend on general economic conditions, interest rates and consumer spending patterns. These markets also have seasonal characteristics. Generally, demand for our value-added services delivered to existing customers increases during the second calendar quarter of each year as a result of the automotive industry\u2019s spring selling season and decreases during the third quarter of each year due to the impact of scheduled OEM customer plant shutdowns in July for vacations and changeovers in\nproduction lines for new model years. Our value-added services business is also impacted in the fourth quarter by plant shutdowns during the December holiday period. Prolonged adverse weather conditions, particularly in winter months, can also adversely impact margins due to productivity declines and related challenges meeting customer service requirements.\nAdditionally, our transportation services business, excluding dedicated transportation tied to specific customer supply chains, is generally impacted by decreased activity during the post-holiday winter season and, in certain states during hurricane season, because some shippers reduce their shipments and inclement weather impedes trucking operations or underlying customer demand.\nThe impact of these seasonal and cyclical effects on our operating results has historically and in the future may be ameliorated or exacerbated by the timing of the launch of new value-added projects or other customer relationships, or the termination of existing customer projects or relationships. All of these factors could materially and adversely affect our future quarterly operating results.\nOur operations in Mexico, Canada and Colombia make us vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries.\nAs a result of our existing operations in Mexico, Canada and Colombia, an increasing portion of our revenue and expenses are expected to be denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad, including:\n\u2022\nexposure to local economic and political conditions;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls;\n\u2022\nwithholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u2022\ninvestment restrictions or requirements; and\n\u2022\nexport and import restrictions.\nExpanding our business in Mexico, Canada and Colombia, and developing business relationships with manufacturers in such jurisdictions are important strategic elements. As a result, exposure to the risks described above may be greater in the future. The likelihood of such risks and their potential effect on us may vary from country to country and are unpredictable. However, any such occurrences could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to additional impairment charges due to future declines in the fair value of our equity securities.\nWe hold equity securities as short term investments. Holding equity securities subjects us to fluctuations in the market value of our investment portfolio based on current market prices. Marketable securities are carried at fair value and are marked to market at the end of each quarter, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, unless the declines in value are judged to be other-than-temporary, in which case an impairment charge is included in the determination of net income. In past years, we have had to record other-than-temporary impairment charges for marketable equity securities classified as available-for-sale. Although we currently consider unrealized losses within our investment portfolio to be temporary, we may incur future impairment charges if declines in market values continue and/or worsen and impairments are no longer considered temporary.\nWe may be required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets, causing our financial condition and results to be negatively impacted.\nWhen we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price may be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions. At December 31, 2014, our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were approximately $128.3 million. Under current accounting standards, if we determine goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, we would be required to write down the value of these assets. We are required to test goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently, whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill below its carrying amount. We annually test goodwill for impairment during the third fiscal quarter of each year. As a result of our impairment analysis, we have concluded that no impairment charge was necessary for the year ended December 31, 2014. However, we cannot provide assurance whether we will be required to take an impairment charge in the future. Any impairment charge would have a negative effect on our financial results.\nAny disputes that arise between us and CenTra, an entity controlled by our majority shareholders, with respect to our past and ongoing relationships could harm our business operations.\nDisputes may arise between CenTra, an entity controlled by our majority shareholders, and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships, including:\n\u2022\nlabor, tax, employee benefit, indemnification and other matters arising from our separation from CenTra;\n\u2022\nemployee retention and recruiting;\n\u2022\nthe nature, quality and pricing of transitional services CenTra has agreed to provide us; and\n\u2022\nbusiness opportunities that may be attractive to both CenTra and us.\nWe may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts and even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party. The agreements we have entered into with CenTra and with other affiliates controlled by our majority shareholders may be amended upon agreement between the parties.\nOur revenue is somewhat dependent on North American automotive industry production volume, and may be negatively affected by future downturns in North American automobile production.\nA significant portion of our larger customers are concentrated in the North American automotive industry. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, 28% of our operating revenues were derived from customers in the North American automotive industry. Our business and growth largely depend on continued demand for its services from customers in this industry.\nDuring the global economic crisis of the last decade that began 2008, the substantial decline in consumer demand for automobile purchases led to significant reductions in light vehicle production in North America, as General Motors and Chrysler restructured through bankruptcies and other North American manufacturers re-scaled their operations to adjust to changing market demands. As a result of plant closings and the general downturn in North American automobile production, we experienced significant variability in our revenues derived from our North American automotive customers during this period, including a 44% decrease from $303.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 to $168.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2009.\nWhile North American automobile production has rebounded and our revenues from our North American automotive customers have in turn recovered since the economic crisis, any future downturns in North American automobile production, which also impacts our steel and metals customers, could similarly affect our revenues in future periods.\nOur business derives a large portion of revenue from a few major customers, and the loss of any one or more of them as customers, or a reduction in their operations, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA large portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of major customers concentrated in the automotive, steel and metals, and energy industries. Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 36% of our operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our contracts with customers generally contain cancellation clauses, and there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to utilize our services or that they will continue at the same levels. Further, there can be no assurance that these customers will not be affected by a future downturn in demand, which would result in a reduction in their operations and corresponding need for our services. Moreover, our customers may individually lose market share, apart from general economic trends. If our major customers lose U.S. market share, they may have less need for services. A reduction in or termination of services by one or more of its major customers could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations.\nCustomer manufacturing plant closures could have a material effect on our performance.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the operation and management of operating facilities, which are often located adjacent to a customer\u2019s manufacturing plant and are directly integrated into the customer\u2019s production line process. We may experience significant revenue loss and shut-down costs, including costs related to early termination of leases, causing our business to suffer if customers closed their plants or significantly modified their capacity or supply chains at a plant that we service.\nIn past years, we have had to discontinue and close operations in response to our customers closing their related manufacturing plants and have incurred shut-down charges as a result of those closings. Although we do not currently operate any facilities linked to announced plant closures, our results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted by future announcements of plant closures.\nIf our customers are able to reduce their total cost structure regarding their employees that provide internal logistics and transportation services, our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nA major driver for customers to use third-party logistics providers instead of their own personnel is their inherent high cost of labor. Third-party logistics service providers such as us are generally able to provide such services more efficiently than otherwise could be provided \u201cin-house\u201d primarily as a result of our lower and more flexible employee cost structure. Historically, this has been the case in the U.S. automotive industry. If, however, the U.S. automotive industry, which has received concessions from the United Auto Worker and other unions, or any other industry we serve, is able to renegotiate the terms of its labor contracts or otherwise reduce its total cost structure regarding its employees, or if it has to make concessions as a result of pressure from the unions with which it deals, we may not be able to provide our customers with an attractive alternative for their logistics needs and our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe face a variety of risks relating to our material handling services.\nFor certain value-added material handling services, we lease warehouses and distribution facilities on a long-term basis. In one situation, we also assumed employment arrangements from a customer. Such actions may require substantial investments in property, plant and equipment, personnel and management capacity. If we acquire or take over existing facilities of a customer or a competing provider, we may in some jurisdictions assume by operation of law all rights and obligations arising under the existing employment relationships between our customer or the competing provider and the employees employed at such facilities. This may result in additional costs and obligations to be incurred by us, such as wages and employee benefits, which may include severance or other employment-related obligations.\nWe commit facilities, labor and equipment on the basis of projections of future demand, and our projections may prove inaccurate as a result of changes to economic conditions or a decision by our customers to terminate or not\nto renew their contracts with us. We generally strive to minimize these risks for our dedicated warehouses and other assets by negotiating coterminous lease agreements, which have the same duration as that of the assets deployed to service the contract. Where we take assignment of existing employment relationships, we typically seek indemnities for employee service liabilities from the previous employer. Our revenue, cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to secure terms coterminous with our customer commitments or to be indemnified for employee service liabilities. This could result in an impairment of assets and adversely affect our cash flow.\nUnder some of our third-party logistics agreements, we have agreed to reduce our prices over time in accordance with anticipated cost savings and efficiency improvements. If we are compelled to perform our contractual obligations on unfavorable terms (including when such anticipated cost savings and improvements are not realized), our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur customers may terminate contracts before completion or choose not to renew contracts, which could adversely affect our business and reduce our revenue.\nThe terms of our customer contracts, particularly for value-added services, often range up to five years. Many of our customer contracts may be terminated by such customers with or without cause, with one to six months\u2019 notice and in most cases without significant penalty. The termination of a substantial percentage of these contracts could adversely affect our business and reduce our revenue. Failure to meet contractual or performance requirements could result in cancellation or non-renewal of a contract. In addition, a contract termination or significant reduction in work assigned to us by a major customer could cause us to experience a higher than expected number of unassigned employees or other underutilized resources, which would reduce our operating margin until we are able to reduce or reallocate headcount or other overcapacity. We may not be able to replace any customer that elects to terminate or not renew its contract, which would adversely affect our business and revenues.\nOur business is highly dependent on dynamic information technology.\nThe provision and application of information technology is an important competitive factor in the logistics industry. Among other things, our information systems must frequently interact with those of our customers and transportation providers. Our future success will depend on our ability to employ logistics software that meets industry standards and customer demands. Although there are redundancy systems and procedures in place, the failure of the hardware or software that supports our information technology systems could significantly disrupt client workflows and cause economic losses for which we could be held liable and which would damage our reputation.\nWe expect customers to continue to demand more sophisticated and fully integrated information technology systems from their logistics providers, which are compatible with their own information technology environment. In addition, our competitors may have or develop information technology systems that permit them to be more cost effective and otherwise better situated to meet customer demands than we are able to develop. Larger competitors may be able to develop or license information technology systems more cost effectively than we can by spreading the cost across a larger customer base, and competitors with greater financial resources may be able to develop or purchase information technology systems that we cannot afford. If we fail to meet the demands of our customers or protect against disruptions of both our and our customers\u2019 operations, we may lose customers, which could seriously harm our business and adversely affect our operating results and operating cash flow.\nWe license a variety of software that is used in our information technology system. As a result, the success and functionality of our information technology is dependent upon our ability to continue to license the software platforms upon which it is built. There can be no assurances that we will be able to maintain these licenses or replace the functionality provided by this software on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nAdditionally, while we are not aware of any pending infringement matters and we believe that we have all necessary licenses to implement our system, we could be subject to claims of infringement in the future. The failure to maintain these licenses or any significant delay in the replacement of, or interference in, our use of this software or any claims of infringement, even those without merit, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant labor dispute involving us or one or more of our customers, or that could otherwise affect our operations, could reduce our revenues and harm our profitability.\nA substantial number of our employees and of the employees of our largest customers are members of industrial trade unions and are employed under the terms of collective bargaining agreements. Each of our unionized facilities has a separate agreement with the union that represents the workers at only that facility. Labor disputes involving either us or our customers could affect our operations. If the UAW and our automotive customers and their suppliers are unable to negotiate new contracts and our customers\u2019 plants experience slowdowns or closures as a result, our revenue and profitability could be negatively impacted. A labor dispute involving another supplier to our customers that results in a slowdown or closure of our customers\u2019 plants to which we provide services could also have a material adverse effect on our business. Significant increases in labor costs as a result of the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements could also be harmful to our business and our profitability. As of December 31, 2014, 1,512 of our 4,218 employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements, 20% of which are subject to contracts that expire in 2015.\nIn addition, strikes, work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees may affect our ability to meet our customers\u2019 needs, and customers may do more business with competitors if they believe that such actions may adversely affect our ability to provide service. We may face permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service. The terms of our future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to enter new business industries or segments successfully, our future growth prospects could suffer.\nOur growth strategy requires us to enter into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience. In addition to the risks inherent in entering new markets or lines of business, our success in entering such new markets or businesses may be dependent on our ability to create new and appropriate business models. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop successful business models that can adapt to new lines of businesses in which we have little or no experience.\nProduct recalls or isolated product liability claims may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRecalls may result in decreased production levels due to (i) the manufacturer focusing its efforts on addressing the problems underlying the recall, as opposed to generating new sales volume, and (ii) consumers electing not to purchase automobiles manufactured by manufacturers initiating the recall, or by automotive companies in general, while such recalls persist. Any reductions in the production volumes of our customers could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe provide sub-assembly services for certain customers in the United States and Mexico. In the ordinary course of operations, we manage charge-backs for non-conforming goods or service failure claims. To the extent that product recalls or isolated product liability claims are caused by or involve components we have sub-assembled, we may be subject to risk of loss or other damage claims in connection with such sub-assembly services. We are not involved in the design, development or specification of any components. Our customers purchase all components and also specify sub-assembly processes and related equipment. We do warrant that items assembled by us will be fit and sufficient for the particular purpose intended by our customer and will, in particular, achieve specific testing, assembly and data capture criteria established by our customer for the sub-assembly process,\nbased on detailed interim and final testing. If we do not expressly modify or exclude language appearing in the general terms and conditions attached to its major customers\u2019 purchase orders, such losses or claims could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBecause Matthew T. Moroun and Manuel J. Moroun hold a controlling interest in us, the influence of our public shareholders over significant corporate actions is limited, and we are not subject to certain corporate governance standards that apply to other publicly traded companies.\nAs of December 31, 2014, Matthew T. Moroun, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, Manuel J. Moroun, a member of our Board of Directors, and trusts controlled by Manuel J. Moroun and Matthew T. Moroun, together own approximately 71.8% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, the Moroun family has the power to:\n\u2022\ncontrol all matters submitted to our shareholders;\n\u2022\nelect our directors;\n\u2022\nadopt, extend or remove any anti-takeover provisions that are available to us; and\n\u2022\nexercise control over our business, policies and affairs.\nThis concentration of ownership could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock, and our ability to engage in significant transactions, such as a merger, acquisition or liquidation, will require the consent of the Moroun family. Conflicts of interest could arise between us and the Moroun family, and any conflict of interest may be resolved in a manner that does not favor us. Accordingly, the Moroun family could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements of which our other shareholders would not approve or make decisions with which they may disagree. Because of the Morouns\u2019 level of ownership, we have elected to be treated as a controlled company in accordance with the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market. Accordingly, we are not required to comply with NASDAQ Stock Market rules which would otherwise require a majority of our board to be comprised of independent directors and require our board to have a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee comprised of independent directors.\nThe Moroun family may continue to retain control of us for the foreseeable future and may decide not to enter into a transaction in which shareholders would receive consideration for our common stock that is much higher than the then-current market price of our common stock. In addition, the Moroun family could elect to sell a controlling interest in us to a third-party and our other shareholders may not be able to participate in such transaction or, if they are able to participate in such a transaction, such shareholders may receive less than the then current fair market value of their shares. Any decision regarding their ownership of us that the Moroun family may make at some future time will be in their absolute discretion, subject to applicable laws and fiduciary duties.\nSales of our common shares by the Moroun family or issuances by us in connection with future acquisitions or otherwise could cause the price of our common stock to decline or may dilute your ownership in us.\nIf the Moroun family sells a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the future, the market price of our common stock could decline. A perception among investors that these sales may occur could produce the same effect. The Moroun family has rights to require us to include shares of common stock owned by them in registration statements that we may file. By exercising their registration rights and selling a large number of shares of common stock, the Moroun family could cause the price of our common stock to decline. Furthermore, the inclusion of shares of common stock held by the Moroun family in a registration statement initiated by us could impair our ability to raise needed capital by depressing the price at which we could sell our common stock.\nOne component of our business strategy is to make acquisitions. In the event of any future acquisitions, we could issue additional shares of common stock, which would have the effect of diluting your percentage ownership of our common stock and could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nIn addition, we could decide to issue common stock in connection with capital raising efforts or otherwise. Issuances of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales will occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or be depressed.\nOur stock trading volume may not provide adequate liquidity for investors.\nAlthough shares of our common stock are traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the average daily trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger transportation and logistics companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of a sufficient number of willing buyers and sellers of the common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the daily average trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of the common stock in a brief period of time, or the expectation of these sales, could cause a decline in the price of our common stock. Additionally, low trading volumes may limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to sell shares of our common stock.\nOur ability to pay regular dividends on our common stock is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, any covenants included in our credit facilities any legal or contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and other factors the Board of Directors deem relevant.\nWe have adopted a cash dividend policy which anticipates a total annual dividend of $0.28 per share of common stock. However, the payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend, among other things, on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, any covenants included in our credit facilities, any legal or contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and other factors the Board of Directors deem relevant. As a consequence of these limitations and restrictions, we may not be able to make, or may have to reduce or eliminate, the payment of dividends on our common stock. Additionally, any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws have, and under Michigan law are subject to, provisions that could delay, deter or prevent a change of control.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a proposed takeover of our Company. These provisions could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our Company or an acquisition of our Company at a price that our shareholders may find attractive. These provisions also may discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. The existence of these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na requirement that special meetings of our shareholders may be called only by our Board of Directors, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, our Chief Executive Officer or the holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations; and\n\u2022\nthe authority of our Board of Directors to issue, without shareholder approval, preferred stock with such terms as the Board of Directors may determine, including in connection with our implementation of any shareholders rights plan, or \u201cpoison pill.\u201d\nIn addition, certain provisions of Michigan law that apply to us could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control or acquisition of our Company.", "PERMNO": 90605, "SIC": 4210, "TIC": "ULH"}
