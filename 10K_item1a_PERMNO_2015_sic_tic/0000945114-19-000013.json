{"cik": "945114", "company": "SYSTEMAX INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThere are a number of factors and variables described below that may affect our future results of operations and financial condition. Other factors of which we are currently not aware or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our results of operations and financial position.\nRisks Related to the Economy and Our Industries\n\u2022\nGeneral economic conditions, including those that can result in decreased customer confidence and spending, could result in our failure to achieve our historical sales growth rates and profit levels.\nBoth we and our customers are subject to global political, economic and market conditions, including trade and tariff uncertainties, customer inventory levels in the marketplace, borrowing ability, economic conditions in the manufacturing industry, increases in inflation, interest rates, freight costs and energy costs, as well as the impact of natural disasters, military action and the threat of terrorism. Our consolidated results of operations are directly affected by economic conditions in North America, and our supply chain for imported product is affected by conditions in Asia (particularly China). We may experience a decline in sales as a result of poor economic conditions and the lack of visibility relating to future orders, (as well as due to the other risks discussed below). Our results of operations depend upon, among other things, our ability to maintain and increase sales volumes with existing customers, our ability to limit price reductions and manage price increases, our ability to manage freight and shipping costs and maintain our margins, our ability to attract new customers and increase our market share, and the financial condition of our customers. A decline in the economy that adversely affects our customers, causing them to limit or defer their spending or that hampers their ability to pay for products would likely adversely affect our sales, prices and profitability as well. We cannot predict with any certainty whether we will be able to maintain or improve upon historical sales volumes with existing customers, maintain or grow our historical margins, and whether we will be able to attract new customers.\nIn response to economic and market conditions, from time to time we have undertaken initiatives to reduce our cost structure where appropriate, including workforce reductions. However, these actions may not be sufficient to meet current and future changes in economic and market conditions and allow us to continue to achieve the growth rates and levels of profitability we experienced in the past.\n\u2022\nThe imposition of tariffs and other trade barriers, as well as retaliatory trade measures, have caused us to raise the prices on certain of our products and seek alternate sources of supply, which could negatively impact our sales or disrupt our operations.\nOur industry is subject to risks associated with U.S. and foreign laws relating to importing products, including quotas, duties, tariffs or taxes, as well as other charges or restrictions, which could adversely affect our ability to import products at desired cost or volume levels.\nAs has been widely reported across the broader marketplace, during 2018 the United States enacted three sets of tariffs on a variety of foreign sourced goods. While we experienced minimal impact from the first two tariff lists during 2018, the third list, which went into effect at the end of the third quarter of 2018, imposes tariffs on a broader group of products and does impact a number of the private label products we source directly from China as well as third-party branded product our U.S. suppliers source from China. These tariffs have increased and will continue to increase our costs of procurement.\nWe believe the timing and extent of any financial impact of the announced tariffs will be gradual as we sell through existing inventory purchased prior to the tariffs being implemented, strategically increase prices to offset the incremental costs on certain products and shift certain products to alternative sources where available. However, our use of alternate sources of supply, such as utilizing new vendors in additional countries, entails various risks, such as identifying, vetting and managing new business relationships, reliance on new vendors, maintaining quality control over their products, and protecting our intellectual property rights. Further, the Company may not be able to fully offset any such tariffs through product price increases as increases in product prices in a competitive market would likely decrease demand for the Company\u2019s products.\nSince 2018 the U.S. has been conducting an industry wide anti-dumping investigation of \u201csteel racks\u201d product imported from China. The investigation will likely result in the assessment of anti-dumping duties and countervailing duties assessed against U.S. distributors of these products, such as the Company. While the Company does not believe the outcome of the investigation or any resultant assessments will have a material adverse effect on the Company, there can be no assurance that the fines and duties will not be significant in the period within which they occur.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively or expeditiously mitigate these challenges, which could disrupt our operations, negatively impact our sales and would have a material adverse effect on our financial results. However, we do not believe that we will be disproportionately impacted by these costs as compared to our competitors, and we will continue to evaluate marketplace conditions and implement other actions or strategies as the need arises.\nFinally, we cannot predict whether additional U.S. and foreign customs quotas, duties (including anti-dumping or countervailing duties), tariffs, taxes or other charges or restrictions, requirements as to where raw materials must be purchased, additional workplace regulations or other restrictions on our imports will be imposed in the future and if so, what effect such actions would have on our costs of operations.\n\u2022\nThere is a tight labor market for the employees we hire, which can impact our growth plans.\nMany of our competitors also compete with us for recruiting and retaining talented and experienced employees, particularly in markets where we and they have significant distribution facilities. We have also experienced high levels of turnover in our warehouse/distribution operations, consistent with current market conditions. This aspect of competition is aggravated by the current tight labor market in the U.S. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to timely recruit, train and retain employees sufficient to support its growth strategies or will not have to incur increased compensation costs in order to do so. Our results of operations have been and in the future could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs.\n\u2022\nOur industry is evolving and consolidating, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nThe MRO and industrial equipment industry are consolidating as customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment and of the need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations. This consolidation has and will continue to cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by competitors, or as competitors with a new lower cost business models are able to operate with lower prices.\n\u2022\nSales tax laws may be interpreted in a manner that could result in ecommerce and direct mail retailers to being held to have been required to collect sales taxes in states where we believe the then current laws did not require us to do so. This could result in us having substantial tax liabilities for past sales.\nOur United States subsidiaries historically collected and remitted sales tax in states in which the subsidiaries have physical presence or in which we believed sufficient nexus existed which obligated us to collect sales tax. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company voluntarily registered its primary selling subsidiary in the U.S. that generate taxable sales for sales tax collection in the states. States may, from time to time in the future, claim that we had state-related activities constituting physical nexus to have required such collection, or that our sale of goods to customers in their state, or directly to the state and its political subdivisions, created nexus for sales tax purposes. Such efforts by states have increased recently, as states seek to raise revenues without increasing the income tax burden on residents. We relied on United States Supreme Court decisions which hold that, without Congressional authority, a state may not enforce a sales tax collection obligation on a company that has no physical presence in the state and whose only contacts with the state are through the use of interstate commerce such as the mailing of catalogs into the state and the delivery of goods by mail or common carrier. We cannot predict whether the nature or level of contacts we had with a particular state in the past will be deemed enough to have required us to collect sales tax in that state. A successful assertion by one or more states that we should have collected sales tax on the sale of merchandise in such state could result in substantial tax liabilities related to past sales. See Legal Proceedings.\n\u2022\nVolatility in commodity prices may adversely affect gross margins.\nSome of our products contain significant amounts of commodity-priced materials, such as steel, copper, petroleum derivatives or rare earth minerals, and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market. Fluctuations in the price of fuel could affect transportation costs. Our ability to pass on such increases in costs in a timely manner depends on market conditions. The inability to pass along cost increases could result in lower gross margins. In addition, higher prices could impact demand for these products, resulting in lower sales volumes.\n\u2022\nEvents such as acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters, data security breaches, changes in law, or large losses could adversely affect our insurance coverage and insurance expense, resulting in an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.\nWe insure for certain property and casualty risks consisting primarily of physical loss to property, business interruptions resulting from property losses, worker\u2019s compensation, comprehensive general liability, and auto liability. Insurance coverage is obtained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract. Although we believe that our insurance coverage is reasonable, significant events such as acts of war and terrorism, economic conditions, data security breaches, judicial decisions, legislation, natural disasters and large losses could materially affect our insurance obligations and future expense. Furthermore, the occurrence of an uninsured significant event could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nAdverse weather events or natural disasters could negatively affect or disrupt our operations. We may be affected by global climate changes or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such potential change.\nCertain areas in which we operate are susceptible to severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods. Our ability to provide efficient distribution of core business products from our or third-party drop ship distribution centers is critical to our business strategy. Disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports may affect our ability to both maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis, which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations. We cannot predict whether or to what extent damage caused by these events will affect our operations or the economies in regions where we operate. These adverse events could result in disruption of our operations, our purchasing or distribution capabilities, interruption of our business that exceeds our insurance coverage, our inability to collect from customers and increased operating costs. Our business or results of operations may be adversely affected by these and other negative effects of these events.\n\u2022\nEnvironmental Matters\nUnder various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations in North America, a current or previous owner or operator (including the lessee) of real property may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substance at such real property. Such laws and regulation often impose liability without regard to fault. We lease most of our facilities. In connection with such leases, we could be held liable for the costs of removal or remedial actions with respect to hazardous substances. Although we have not been notified of, and are not otherwise aware of, any material\nreal property environmental liability, claim or non-compliance, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur remediation or other costs in connection with real property environmental matters in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Company\n\u2022\nRisk regarding new distribution facility timing/expense\nOur ability to maintain available capacity in our distribution operations for stocked inventory and to enable on time shipment and deliveries, such as by timely implementing additional distribution resources, whether in the form of expanded or additional temporary and permanent facilities we operate or by outsourcing certain functions to third-party distribution and logistics partners, is critical to our ability to service our growing business. If we do not accurately forecast our future warehousing and distribution center needs, and then timely plan, fund on budget, launch and efficiently operate new distribution resources and facilities when needed, our operations and financial results could be materially adversely impacted. In addition, expanding and/or enhancing our distribution network (as we plan to do later in 2019) would have an adverse impact on operating expenses as a percentage of sales, inventory turnover, and working capital requirements in the periods prior to and for some time following the commencement of operations for each such expansion or enhancement.\n\u2022\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for most of our products and services. The loss or interruption of these relationships could impact our sales volumes, the levels of inventory we must carry, and/or result in sales delays and/or higher inventory costs from new suppliers.\nWe purchase a portion of our products from major distributors and directly from large manufacturers who may deliver those products directly to our customers (\u201cdrop ship\u201d), as well as from smaller more regional vendors. These drop ship delivery relationships enable us to make available to our customers a wide selection of products without having to maintain large amounts of inventory. The termination or interruption of our relationships with any of these drop ship suppliers could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe purchase a number of our products, particularly private label and white label products, from vendors located outside of the United States. Raw material costs used in our vendors\u2019 products (steel, tungsten, etc.) and energy costs may increase, which may result in increased production costs for our vendors, which they may seek to pass along to us. Difficulties encountered by one or several of these suppliers could halt or disrupt production and delay completion or cause the cancellation of our orders. Delays or interruptions in the transportation network could result in loss or delay of timely receipt of product required to fulfill customer orders. Our ability to find qualified vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. In this regard, in response to the tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods imported from China, we are seeking alternative sources of supply, such as utilizing new vendors in additional countries, which entails various risks, such as identifying, vetting and managing new business relationships, reliance on these new vendors maintaining quality control over their products, and protecting our intellectual property rights.\nPolitical or financial instability, merchandise quality issues, product safety concerns, trade restrictions, work stoppages, tariffs, foreign currency exchange rates, transportation capacity and costs, inflation, civil unrest, outbreaks of pandemics and other factors are beyond our control. These and other issues affecting our vendors could materially adversely affect our revenue and gross profit.\n\u2022\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for shipping and delivery services and managing the logistics of a distribution business can impact our results of operations and margins.\nWe face certain risks due to our reliance on common carrier delivery services for shipping inventoried merchandise to customers and our reliance on drop ship deliveries directly to customers by our product vendors for products we do not hold in inventory (such as freight increases, timely delivery and customer service, delays due to work stoppages, etc.). We also must effectively manage our ability to maintain available capacity in our distribution operations for stocked inventory and to enable on time shipment and deliveries, such as by timely implementing additional or alternative distribution resources, whether in the form of additional facilities we operate or by outsourcing certain functions to third-party distribution and logistics partners.\nIncreases in freight and shipping costs charged to us by third parties could adversely affect our margins to the extent the increases cannot be passed along to customers, and factors affecting the shipping and distribution of products imported to the United States by us or our domestic vendors, such as global availability of shipping containers and fuel costs, can\nalso affect our business. The fuel costs of our independent freight companies have been volatile. Our vendors and independent freight carriers typically look to pass increased costs along to us through price increases. When we are forced to accept these price increases, we may not be able to pass them along to our customers, resulting in lower margins.\n\u2022\nChanges in customer, product, vendor, sourcing or channel sales mix, could cause the gross margin and ultimately operating margins to decline; failure to mitigate these pressures could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur gross margins are dependent on the mix of products we sell, decisions to drop ship rather than stock products in our distribution centers, decisions to offer private label alternatives or branded offerings, price changes by manufacturers, and pricing actions by competitors. In addition, we could be adversely affected by a continuation of our customers\u2019 shift to lower-priced products.\n\u2022\nWe rely to a great extent on our information and telecommunications systems, and significant system failures or outages, or our failure to properly evaluate, upgrade or replace our systems, or the failure of our security/safety measures to protect our systems and websites, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe rely on a variety of information and telecommunications systems including internally developed software, third-party purchased software and third-party cloud-based software in order to manage our business, including our customer, vendor, employee, facilities, finance, management and corporate operations. Our success is dependent in large part on the accuracy and proper use of our information systems, including our telecommunications systems, which are utilized in all aspects of our business. To manage our growth, we need to continually evaluate the effectiveness and adequacy of our existing systems and procedures to ensure they are keeping pace with changes in our business. These systems, whether internally developed, purchased or cloud-based may need to be modified, upgraded or replaced from time to time. System modifications, upgrades or replacements involve costs as well as the risk of implementation delays and not operating as intended. We rely on third parties such as telecommunication carriers, internet service providers and our own employees to provide the technology services and expertise on which we depend. There are risks that third parties may incur outages or circumstances where they cannot provide the services we require as intended or that our employees do not have the expertise to remediate system outages or technical problems that may arise. We have experienced some delays and operational problems in implementing new IT systems in the past. We anticipate that we will regularly need to make capital expenditures to upgrade and modify our management information systems, including software and hardware, as we grow and the needs of our business change. We have disaster recovery systems and system backups are routinely done for certain critical systems, but not for every system. The occurrence of a significant system failure, electrical or telecommunications outages or our failure to ensure our IT employees are properly trained and technically proficient, or that our systems are adequate, effective and beneficial to our business, or our failure to expand or successfully implement new systems could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\u2022\nUse of Cloud-Based Systems and Infrastructure Provided by Third Parties Present Significant Risks to Our Business.\nIn 2018, we moved certain of our operating systems and management information systems resources and storage to a leading cloud-based platform operated by a well-known third-party provider of technology services, and we no longer operate or maintain such systems or store related data on our own servers. This managed cloud-based platform is operated on a \u201cinfrastructure as a service\u201d model (\u201cIAAS\u201d). Accordingly, exposure to third-party service outages and data loss, or a failure of the network or loss of connectivity can adversely affect our business. In addition, since the data resides on the cloud, we and our customers are forced to rely on the physical and information security of the vendor to protect their valuable information. There can be no assurance that the cloud-based systems on which we rely will not experience such outages or failures or that data privacy/information security will not be breached.\n\u2022\nData and security breaches, and other disruptions in our information technology systems, could compromise confidential or private information and expose us to liability, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nOur operations are dependent upon information technology that encompasses all of our major business functions. We use our information systems to, among other things, monitor our supply chain, make purchasing decisions, manage and replenish inventories, coordinate our sales and marketing activities, fill and ship customer orders on a timely basis and to monitor and record our financial transactions and results of operations. These systems also process, transmit and store sensitive electronic data, including employee personal information, supplier and customer records, allow vendors and customers to register on our portals and websites, as applicable, or otherwise allow third parties to communicate or interact with us. In addition, we depend on IT systems of third parties, to, among other things, market and distribute products, to operate our websites, host and manage our services, store data, and process transactions. We may share information with\nthese third parties that participate in certain aspects of our business, and we obtain external auditor certification on the controls and security of any significant outsourced service provider according to the SSAE 18 standard. However, there is always a risk that the confidentiality of data held or accessed by them may be compromised.\nIn processing our sales orders, we often collect personal information and transmit credit card information of our customers. If there was a security breach resulting in unauthorized access to or use of such information, we could be subject to claims for identity theft, unauthorized purchases and claims alleging misrepresentation of our privacy and data security practices or other related claims. While the Company believes it conforms to appropriate Payment Card Industry (\u201cPCI\u201d) security standards, any breach involving the loss of credit card information may lead to PCI related fines in the millions of dollars. In the event of a severe breach, credit card providers may prevent our accepting of credit cards.\nWe measure our data security effectiveness through industry accepted methods and remediate significant findings. We maintain and routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery, along with external network security penetration testing by an independent third-party as part of our business continuity preparedness. We also have processes in place to prevent disruptions resulting from the implementation of new software and systems of the latest technology. We have implemented solutions, processes, and procedures to help mitigate the risk of cyber-attacks, such as conducting annual vulnerability testing, and in 2018 engaged consultants to assist us in implementing stronger security measures, identifying remediation initiatives and establishing emergency response plans, but there can be no assurance these efforts will successfully deter future cyber-attacks. Our Board of Directors is responsible for oversight of the activities of our IT department (which reports to our Chief Executive Officer) and receives a quarterly presentation from our Chief Information Officer that covers, among other things, data security and cyber liability matters.\nAlthough our IT systems are protected through various network security measures, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers with which we do business, may nevertheless be vulnerable to security breaches, cyber-attacks (any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our information resources) vandalism, power outages, natural disasters, computer system failures, telecommunication or network failures, computer viruses, malware, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. From time to time. we have experienced efforts by unknown persons, including \u201cbots\u201d, to access or breach our information systems, and these efforts can be expected to continue in the future. While we have successfully defended against such efforts in the past, there can be no assurance we will be able to protect sensitive data and/or the integrity of the Company's information systems and to defend against such efforts in the future.\nAny security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of our confidential information or confidential information of our customers, employees, or suppliers, whether by us or by our third-party service providers, could disrupt our business, expose us to risks of litigation (such as customer or third-party claims that their data has been compromised) and liability, result in a loss of assets or cause reputational damage, and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Any substantial disruption of our systems could impair our ability to process orders, maintain proper levels of inventories, manage customer billings and collections, prepare and present accurate financial statements and related information, and otherwise materially adversely affect our ability to manage our business.\nWe maintain cyber liability risk insurance, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses from any future breaches of our systems, or to cover the cause of the future specific situation/loss at hand. In addition, as privacy and information security laws and standards evolve, we may need to incur significant additional investment in technology and other processes to meet new legal requirements.\n\u2022\nGoodwill and intangible assets may become impaired resulting in a charge to earnings.\nThe Company has made acquisitions in the past of other businesses and these acquisitions resulted in the recording of significant intangible assets and/or goodwill. We are required to test goodwill and intangible assets annually to determine if the carrying values of these assets are impaired or on a more frequent basis if indicators of impairment exist. If any of our goodwill or intangible assets are determined to be impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the period during which the impairment is discovered. Although the carrying amounts of intangible assets and goodwill are relatively small as of December 31, 2018, to the extent the Company makes acquisitions in the future there could again be material amounts of such assets recorded and subject to future impairment testing.\n\u2022\nOur foreign product procurement operations are subject to risks such as foreign regulatory trade and customs requirements such as the tariffs and duties matters discussed above, and the political and economic conditions of the jurisdictions from which we procure products.\nBecause we sell products all across North America and procure product from abroad, including from China, we operate internationally and as a result, we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally, such as risks related to the differing legal, political and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions. Risks inherent to operating internationally include:\n\u2022\nChanges in a country\u2019s economic or political conditions;\n\u2022\nTariff and trade uncertainties;\n\u2022\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nDifficulties with staffing and managing international relationships;\n\u2022\nUnexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nChanges in transportation and shipping costs; and\n\u2022\nEnforcement of intellectual property rights.\nThe functional currencies of our businesses outside of the U.S. are the local currencies. Changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the U.S. Dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets, liabilities, net sales, cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange gains or losses. The primary currencies to which we have exposure are the Canadian Dollar and the India Rupee. Our operating results and profitability may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks. For example, we currently have operations located in countries outside the United States, and non-U.S. sales accounted for approximately 4.7% of our net sales from continuing operations during 2018. To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, our foreign revenues and profits will be reduced when translated into U.S. dollars.\n\u2022\nWe are exposed to various inventory risks, such as being unable to profitably resell excess or obsolete inventory and/or the loss of product return from our vendors; such events could lower our gross margins or result in inventory write-downs that would reduce reported future earnings.\nOur inventory is subject to risk due to changes in market demand for particular products. If we fail to manage our inventory of older products we may have excess or obsolete inventory. We may have limited rights to return purchases to certain suppliers. The elimination of purchase return privileges could lower our gross margin or result in inventory write-downs.\nWe also take advantage of attractive product pricing by making opportunistic bulk inventory purchases; any resulting excess and/or obsolete inventory that we are not able to re-sell could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Any inability to make such bulk inventory purchases may significantly impact our sales and profitability.\n\u2022\nWe may encounter difficulties with acquisitions and other strategic transactions which could harm our business.\nWe expect to pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions that we believe will either expand or complement our business in new or existing markets or further enhance the value and offerings we are able to provide to our existing or future potential customers.\nAcquisitions and other strategic transactions involve numerous risks and challenges, including the following:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from the normal operation of our business;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key associates and customers of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties managing and integrating operations in geographically dispersed locations;\n\u2022\nthe potential for deficiencies in internal controls at acquired companies;\n\u2022\nincreases in our expenses and working capital requirements, which reduce our return on invested capital;\n\u2022\nlack of experience operating in the geographic market or industry sector of the acquired business; and\n\u2022\nexposure to unanticipated liabilities of acquired companies.\nTo integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our management information systems, operating systems and internal controls, and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations. The difficulties of this integration may be further complicated by geographic distances. The integration of acquired businesses may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business.\n\u2022\nOur business is dependent on certain key personnel, including the recent engagement of new senior executives.\nOur business depends largely on the efforts and abilities of certain key senior management employees. The loss of the services of one or more of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to litigation risk due to the nature of our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. These include patent, trademark or other intellectual property matters, employment law matters, states sales tax claims on internet/ecommerce transactions, product liability, commercial disputes, consumer sales practices, or other matters. In addition, as a public company we could from time to time face claims relating to corporate or securities law matters. The defense and/or outcome of such lawsuits or proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business. See \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d.\n\u2022\nOur profitability can be adversely affected by changes in our income tax exposure due to changes in tax rates or laws, changes in our effective tax rate due to changes in the mix of earnings among different countries, restrictions on utilization of tax benefits and changes in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nChanges in our income tax expense due to changes in the mix of U.S. and non-U.S. revenues and profitability, changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate has been in the past and could be in the future adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, restrictions on utilization of tax benefits, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or by material audit assessments.\nThe carrying value of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in those jurisdictions. In the case of where several years of losses occur in a jurisdiction, there is a risk that the Company would need to reserve its deferred tax assets which would likely result in a material tax expense being recorded in the period that such reserve is established. Similarly, in the case where a reserve against deferred tax assets has previously been established, successive years of profitability would require the reversal of deferred tax asset reserves which would likely result in a material tax benefit in the period that the reserve is deemed to be no longer necessary. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audit in our various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our profitability.\n\u2022\nWe exited our France business in 2018, our SARL Businesses in 2017 and our NATG business in 2015 and could incur costs in excess of our estimated exit expenses.\nThe Company has substantially completed the wind-down activities related to the sale of the France business, but continues to provide limited transition services to the business. Also, the Company may incur additional charges related to statutory tax indemnities given at closing. The Company has substantially completed the wind-down activities related to the sale of the SARL Businesses and most of the NATG wind-down activities, although certain NATG activities related to collecting remaining accounts receivable, subleasing remaining retail store and warehouse spaces and settling accounts payable and other contingent liabilities continue. The Company expects that additional SARL and NATG wind-down costs incurred during 2019 or later will aggregate between $1 and $2 million, which will be to be presented in discontinued operations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to timely exit its existing NATG lease commitments at currently recorded cost levels. Failure to achieve these expectations will result in increased cash exit costs for the Company.\n\u2022\nChanges in accounting standards or practices, as well as new accounting pronouncements or interpretations, may require us to account for and report our financial results in a different manner in the future, which may be less favorable than the manner used historically.\nA change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results of operations. New accounting pronouncements and interpretations of existing accounting rules and practices have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules may adversely affect our reported financial results.\n\u2022\nConcentration of Ownership and Control Limits Stockholders Ability to Influence Corporate Actions\nRichard Leeds, Robert Leeds, and Bruce Leeds (each are brothers and directors and executive officers of the Company), together with trusts for the benefit of certain members of their respective families and other entities controlled by them, control approximately 67.5% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Due to such holdings, the Leeds\nbrothers together with these trusts and entities are able to determine the outcome of virtually all matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, the appointment of management, amendment of our articles of incorporation, significant corporate transactions (such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets), the payments of dividends on our common stock and the entering into of extraordinary transactions. Further, as a \"controlled company\" under NYSE rules, the Company has elected to opt-out of certain New York Stock Exchange listing standards that, among other things, require listed companies to have a majority of independent directors on their board of directors; the Company does however currently have an independent Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee.\n\u2022\nRisk of Thin Trading and Volatility of our Common Stock Could Impact Stockholder Value\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NYSE and is thinly traded. Volatility of thinly traded stocks is typically higher than the volatility of more liquid stocks with higher trading volumes. The trading of relatively small quantities of shares of common stock by our stockholders may disproportionately influence the price of those shares in either direction. This may result in volatility in our stock price and could exacerbate the other volatility-inducing factors described below. The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations as a result of being thinly traded.", "PERMNO": 81665, "SIC": 5090, "TIC": "SYX"}
