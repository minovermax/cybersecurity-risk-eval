{"cik": "711377", "company": "NEOGEN CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-07-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our securities involves a variety of risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, including, among others, those discussed below. Each of the following risks should be carefully considered, together with all the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nincluding our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and in our other filings with the SEC. Furthermore, additional risks and uncertainty not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. Our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or uncertainties.\nRISKS RELATING TO REVERSE MORRIS TRUST TRANSACTION WITH 3M CORPORATION\nThe pending Reverse Morris Trust transaction with 3M may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all, and the failure to complete the transaction could adversely impact the market price of Neogen common stock, as well as its business and operating results.\nOn December 13, 2021, Neogen, 3M and Garden SpinCo, a newly formed subsidiary of 3M created to carve out 3M\u2019s Food Safety business, entered into a number of agreements pursuant to which, among other things, 3M\u2019s Food Safety business will combine with Neogen in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction, intended to be tax-efficient to\n3M and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Immediately following the transaction, Garden SpinCo stockholders will own, in the aggregate, approximately 50.1% of the issued and outstanding shares of Neogen common stock and pre-merger\nNeogen shareholders will own, in the aggregate, approximately 49.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Neogen common stock. The transaction implies an enterprise value for 3M\u2019s Food Safety business of approximately $3.4 billion based on Neogen\u2019s stock price at July 22, 2022, including $1 billion in new debt to be incurred by 3M\u2019s Food Safety business. 3M\u2019s Food Safety business will fund to 3M consideration valued at approximately $1 billion, subject to closing and other adjustments.\nThe consummation of the transaction is subject to certain conditions, including: (i) the effectiveness of Neogen\u2019s registration statement registering the Neogen common stock to be issued pursuant to the merger agreement, and of Garden SpinCo\u2019s registration statement registering the shares of Garden SpinCo common stock in connection with the distribution; (ii) the approval for listing on NASDAQ of the shares of Neogen common stock to be issued in the merger; and (iii) approval of the share issuance and certain Neogen charter and bylaw amendments by the requisite vote of Neogen\u2019s shareholders. There is no assurance that these conditions will be met or that the transaction will be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all.\nIf the transaction is not completed for any reason, the price of Neogen common stock could decline. Neogen also could experience negative reactions from employees, customers, suppliers or other third parties if the transaction is not completed.\nNeogen and 3M have expended and will continue to expend significant management time and resources and have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses related to the transaction, including legal, advisory, printing and financial services fees. Even if the transaction is completed, any delay in the completion of the transaction could diminish the anticipated benefits of the transaction or result in additional transaction expenses, loss of revenue or other effects associated with uncertainty about the transaction. If the transaction is not consummated because the merger agreement is terminated, Neogen may be required under certain circumstances to pay 3M a termination fee of $140 million or may be required to reimburse 3M for expenses incurred in connection with the transaction.\nIf the transaction is completed, Neogen may not realize the anticipated financial and other benefits, including growth opportunities, expected from the transaction.\nNeogen expects that it will realize synergies, growth opportunities and other financial and operating benefits as a result of the transaction. Neogen\u2019s success in realizing these benefits, and the timing of their realization, depends, among other things, on the successful integration of the business operations of the 3M Food Safety business with Neogen. Even if Neogen is able to integrate the 3M Food Safety business successfully, Neogen cannot predict with certainty if or when these synergies, growth opportunities and other benefits will be realized, or the extent to which they will actually be achieved. For example, the benefits from the transaction could be offset by costs incurred in integrating the 3M Food Safety business or in otherwise consummating the transaction. Realization of any synergies, growth opportunities or other benefits could be affected by the factors described in other risk factors and a number of factors beyond Neogen\u2019s control, including, without limitation, general economic conditions, increased operating costs and regulatory developments.\nThe integration of the 3M Food Safety business with Neogen following the transaction could present significant challenges, and the failure to successfully integrate the 3M Food Safety business could have a material adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThere is a significant degree of difficulty inherent in the process of integrating the 3M Food Safety business with Neogen. These difficulties include:\n\u2022\nthe integration of the 3M Food Safety business with Neogen\u2019s current businesses while carrying on the ongoing operations of all businesses;\n\u2022\nmanaging a significantly larger company than before the consummation of the transaction;\n\u2022\nintegrating the business cultures of the 3M Food Safety business and Neogen, which could prove to be incompatible;\n\u2022\ncreating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems and controlling the costs associated with such matters;\n\u2022\nthe ability to ensure the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting across the combined company;\n\u2022\nintegrating certain information technology, purchasing, accounting, finance, sales, billing, human resources, payroll and regulatory compliance systems; and\n\u2022\nthe potential difficulty in retaining key officers and personnel of Neogen and the 3M Food Safety business.\nThe process of integrating operations could result in significant costs and cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of Neogen\u2019s business. Members of Neogen\u2019s senior management following the transaction may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which could decrease the time they will have to manage the combined company\u2019s business, serve the existing business or operations of Neogen or develop new products or strategies. If Neogen\u2019s senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, the existing business of Neogen or the 3M Food Safety business could be materially adversely affected.\nNeogen\u2019s successful integration of the 3M Food Safety business cannot be assured. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on Neogen\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations after the transaction.\nPursuant to the terms of the transaction, Neogen and Garden SpinCo will be restricted from taking certain actions that could adversely affect the intended tax treatment of the transaction, and such restrictions could significantly impair Neogen\u2019s and Garden SpinCo\u2019s ability to implement strategic initiatives that otherwise would be beneficial.\nThe Tax Matters Agreement executed in connection with the Transaction generally restricts Neogen, Garden SpinCo and their affiliates from taking certain actions after the distribution of Neogen shares that could adversely affect the intended tax treatment of the transaction. In particular:\n\u2022\nfor a two-year\nperiod following the distribution date, except as described below:\n\u2022\nGarden SpinCo will continue the active conduct of its trade or business and the trade or business of certain Garden SpinCo subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nGarden SpinCo will not voluntarily dissolve or liquidate or permit certain Garden SpinCo subsidiaries to voluntarily dissolve or liquidate;\n\u2022\nNeogen and Garden SpinCo will not enter into any transaction or series of transactions (or any agreement, understanding or arrangement) as a result of which one or more persons would acquire (directly or indirectly) stock comprising 50% or more of the vote or value of Garden SpinCo or Neogen (taking into account the stock acquired pursuant to the merger);\n\u2022\nNeogen and Garden SpinCo will not engage in certain mergers or consolidations;\n\u2022\nGarden SpinCo will not, and will not permit certain Garden SpinCo subsidiaries to, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of 30% or more of the gross assets of Garden SpinCo, such subsidiaries, the Garden SpinCo group or the active trade or business of Garden SpinCo or certain Garden SpinCo subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions;\n\u2022\nNeogen and Garden SpinCo will not, and will not permit certain Garden SpinCo subsidiaries to, redeem or repurchase stock or rights to acquire stock, unless certain requirements are met;\n\u2022\nNeogen and Garden SpinCo will not, and will not permit certain Garden SpinCo subsidiaries to, amend their certificates of incorporation (or other organizational documents) or take any other action affecting the voting rights of any stock or stock rights of Neogen or Garden SpinCo; and\n\u2022\nNeogen and Garden SpinCo will not, and will not permit any member of the Garden SpinCo group or Neogen to, take any other action that would, when combined with any other direct or indirect changes in ownership of Garden SpinCo and Neogen stock (including pursuant to the merger), have the effect of causing one or more persons to acquire stock representing 50% or more of the vote or value of Garden SpinCo or Neogen, or otherwise jeopardize the tax-free\nstatus of the transaction;\n\u2022\nduring the time period ending three years after the date of the distribution, Garden SpinCo and Neogen also will be subject to certain restrictions relating to the SpinCo Business in Switzerland; and\n\u2022\nadditionally, none of Garden SpinCo, Neogen or any member of Garden SpinCo group or Neogen may:\n\u2022\ntake, or permit to be taken, any action that could reasonably be expected to jeopardize the qualification of certain Garden SpinCo debt as a security under Section 361(a) of the Code (other than making any payment permitted or required by the terms of the Garden SpinCo debt);\n\u2022\nwithin 90 days of the distribution date, refinance or repay (other than in the ordinary course of business) any third-party debt of any member of the Garden SpinCo group, except as required by the transaction documents; or\n\u2022\npermit any portion of certain nonqualified preferred stock to cease to be outstanding or modify the terms of such stock;\nunless, in each case, prior to taking any such action, Neogen and Garden SpinCo shall have requested that 3M obtain, or request and receive 3M\u2019s prior written consent to obtain, an IRS ruling satisfactory to 3M in its reasonable discretion or provide 3M with an unqualified tax opinion satisfactory to 3M in its sole and absolute discretion to the effect that such action would not jeopardize the intended tax treatment of the transaction, unless 3M waives such requirement. Failure to adhere to these requirements could result in tax being imposed on 3M for which Neogen and Garden SpinCo could bear responsibility and for which Neogen and Garden SpinCo could be obligated to indemnify 3M. Any such indemnification obligation would likely be substantial and would likely have a material adverse effect on Neogen. These restrictions could have a material adverse effect on Neogen\u2019s liquidity and financial condition, and otherwise could impair Neogen\u2019s and Garden SpinCo\u2019s ability to implement strategic initiatives and Garden SpinCo\u2019s and Neogen\u2019s indemnity obligation to 3M might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that shareholders of Neogen may consider favorable.\nCurrent Neogen shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership interest in Neogen will be substantially diluted in the transaction.\nImmediately following the merger with Garden SpinCo, the pre-merger\nNeogen shareholders will own, in the aggregate, approximately 49.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of Neogen common stock. Consequently, Neogen\u2019s pre-merger\nshareholders, as a group, will be substantially diluted in the transaction and have less ability to exercise influence over the management and policies of Neogen following the merger than immediately prior to the transaction.\nRISKS RELATING TO COVID-19\nThe ongoing effects of the COVID-19\npandemic could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSince March 2020, the COVID-19\npandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, continues to depend on many factors outside our control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, related restrictions on travel and transports, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of protective public safety measures including lockdowns, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and consumer demand.\nDuring the course of the pandemic, we modified our business practices to comply with safety measures required by federal, state and local governments, as well as those we determine to be in the best interests of our employees and customers, including implementing social distancing, remote work, reducing employee travel, restricting building access and more. In taking such precautionary actions, we may experience disruptions in our supply chain, operations, facilities and workforce, which could negatively affect efficiency and productivity, cause delays in developing new products, our ability to market products and services, and, ultimately, our stock price and financial performance.\nAdditional future impacts to us may include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on the demand for our products and services, our supply chain and sales and distribution channels, our cost structure and profitability. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption could materially affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe situation regarding the pandemic continues to evolve, and future strains of the COVID-19\nvirus may impact us. To the extent the COVID-19\npandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this section.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nOur business strategy is dependent on successfully promoting internal growth and identifying and integrating acquisitions.\nOur business has grown significantly over the past several years as a result of both internal growth and acquisitions of existing businesses and their products. Management initiatives may be attempted to augment internal growth, such as strengthening our presence in select markets, reallocating research and development funds to products with higher growth potential, development of new applications for our technologies, enhancing our service offerings, continuing key customer efforts, and finding new markets for our products. Failure of these management initiatives may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIdentifying and pursuing acquisition opportunities, integrating these acquisitions into our business and managing their growth requires a significant amount of management\u2019s time and skill. We cannot assure that we will be effective in identifying, integrating or managing future acquisition targets. Our failure to successfully integrate and manage a future acquisition may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, if we continue to experience growth in our business, such growth could place a significant strain on our management, customer service, operations, sales and administrative personnel, and other resources. To serve the needs of our existing and future customers we will be required to recruit, train, motivate and manage qualified employees. We have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs to retain qualified management, sales and marketing, engineering, production, manufacturing and administrative personnel, as well as expenses for marketing and promotional activities. Our ability to manage our planned growth depends upon our success in expanding our operating, management, information and financial systems, which might significantly increase our operating expenses.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our future growth, and if we fail to do so, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to risks relating to existing international operations and expansion into new geographical markets.\nWe focus on expanding sales globally as part of our overall growth strategy and expect sales from outside the United States to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue. In fiscal 2022, sales to customers outside of the U.S. accounted for 39.7% of our total revenue. Neogen\u2019s international operations are subject to general risks related to such operations, including:\n\u2022\npolitical, social and economic instability and disruptions, including social unrest, geopolitical tensions, currency, inflation and interest rate uncertainties;\n\u2022\ngovernment export controls, economic sanctions, embargoes or trade restrictions;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nlimitations on ownership and on repatriation or dividend of earnings;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays and interruptions;\n\u2022\nlabor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;\n\u2022\nincreased compliance costs, including costs associated with disclosure requirements and related due diligence;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;\n\u2022\nlimitations on Neogen\u2019s ability to enforce legal rights and remedies;\n\u2022\ncurrent products may not comply with product standards established by foreign regulatory bodies;\n\u2022\naccess to or control of networks and confidential information due to local government controls and vulnerability of local networks to cyber risks; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nIf Neogen is unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations, these risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy into new geographical markets, our reputation, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, the impact of such risks may be outside of Neogen\u2019s control and could decrease our ability to sell products internationally, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. For example, as a result of the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and resulting heightened economic sanctions from the United States and the international community, Neogen has discontinued sales into Russia and Belarus. The United States and other countries have imposed significant sanctions and could impose even wider sanctions and take other actions should the conflict further escalate. While it is difficult to anticipate the effect the sanctions announced to date may have on Neogen, any further sanctions imposed or actions taken by the United States or other countries, including any expansion of sanctions beyond Russia and Belarus, could affect the global price and availability of raw materials, reduce our sales and earnings or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe rely significantly on our information systems\u2019 infrastructure to support our operations and a failure of these systems and infrastructure and/or a security breach of our information systems could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on operations and results.\nWe rely on our information systems\u2019 infrastructure to integrate departments and functions, to enhance our ability to service customers, to improve our control environment and to manage our cost reduction initiatives. If a security breach or cyberattack of our IT networks and systems occurs, our operations could be interrupted. Any issues involving our critical business applications and infrastructure may adversely impact our ability to manage our operations and the customers we serve. Although we have controls and security measures in place to prevent such attacks, experienced computer hackers are increasingly organized and sophisticated. Malicious attack efforts operate on a large scale and sometimes offer targeted attacks as a paid-for\nservice. In addition, the techniques used to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target.\nWe rely on several information systems throughout our company, as well as those of our third-party business partners, to provide access to our web-based\nproducts and services, keep financial records, analyze results of operations, process customer orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers, store confidential or proprietary information and operate other critical functions. Although Neogen employs system backup measures and engages in information system redundancy planning and processes, such measures, as well as our current disaster recovery plan, may be ineffective or inadequate to address all vulnerabilities. Further, our information systems and our business partners\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 information systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers and other security breaches, including computer viruses and malware, through the internet (including via devices and applications connected to the internet), email attachments and persons with access to these information systems, such as our employees or third parties with whom we do business. As information systems and the use of software and related applications by us, our business partners, suppliers and customers become more cloud-based, there has been an increase in global cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats, including more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks that pose a risk to the security of our information systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data and information.\nWhile we have implemented network security and internal control measures, especially for the purpose of protecting our connected products and services from cyberattacks, and invested in our data and information technology infrastructure, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent a system disruption, attack, or security breach and, as such, the risk of system disruptions and security breaches from a cyberattack remains.\nIf our security and information systems are compromised, or employees fail to comply with the applicable laws and regulations, or this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect our reputation, as well as results of operations, and could result in litigation, the imposition of penalties, or significant expenditures to remediate any damage to persons whose personal information has been compromised.\nDisruption of our manufacturing and service operations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur facilities and our distribution systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made\ndisasters. If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in significant expenses to repair or replace the facility and/or distribution system. If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from terrorism. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third party insurance. If we are unable to obtain sufficient and cost-effective third-party insurance coverage, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.\nOur dependence on suppliers could limit our ability to sell certain products or negatively affect our operating results.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers to provide raw materials and other components in our products, manufacture products that we do not manufacture ourselves and perform services that we do not provide ourselves. Because these suppliers are independent third parties with their own financial objectives, actions taken by them could have a negative effect on our results of operations. The risks of relying on suppliers include our inability to enter into contracts with third party suppliers on reasonable terms, inconsistent or inadequate quality control, relocation of supplier facilities, supplier work stoppages and suppliers\u2019 failure to comply with their contractual obligations. In addition, we currently purchase some raw materials and products from sole or single sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and, therefore, cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. Problems with suppliers and the supply chain could negatively impact our ability to supply the market, substantially decrease sales, lead to higher costs or damage our reputation with our customers.\nWe rely heavily on third-party package delivery services, and a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability.\nWe ship a significant portion of our products to customers through independent package delivery companies, such as UPS, Federal Express and DHL. We also ship our products through other carriers, including national and regional trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the U.S. Postal Service. If one or more of these third-party package delivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage, preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers, our costs could increase and our relationships with some of our customers could be adversely affected. In addition, if one or more of our third-party package delivery providers were to increase prices, and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments within our delivery network, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur business sells many products through distributors, which present risks that could negatively affect our operating results.\nWe sell many of our products, both within and outside of the U.S., through distribution. As a result, we are dependent on distributors to sell our products and assist us in promoting and creating demand for our products. Our distributors sometimes offer products from several different companies, and those distributors may carry our competitors\u2019 products and promote our competitors\u2019 products over our own. We have limited ability, if any, to cause our distributors to devote adequate resources to promoting, marketing, selling and supporting our products. We cannot assure that we will be successful in maintaining and strengthening our relationships with our distributors or establishing relationships with new distributors who have the ability to market, sell and support our products effectively. We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product or region, and the loss of one or more of these distributors could reduce our revenue. Distributors could face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could impact our ability to collect our accounts receivable and negatively impact our financial results. In addition, violations of anti-bribery and anti-corruption or similar laws by our distributors could have a material impact on our business. Further, termination of a distributor relationship could result in increased competition in the applicable jurisdiction. Failing to manage the risks associated with our use of distributors could reduce sales, increase expenses and weaken our competitive position, which could have a negative impact on our operating results.\nThe development of new products entails substantial risk of failure due to the production of non-viable\nproducts, lack of properly identifying market potential, and competitors better serving the marketplace.\nOur growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditures for product development. To execute this strategy, we are continually developing new products for which we believe there should be significant market demand. We cannot assure that we will successfully develop commercially viable products, that the products will be developed on a timely basis to meet market demand or that the relevant market will be properly identified. Our competitors may also adapt more quickly, and deliver superior technologies, price and/or service to better fit our customers\u2019 requirements. If we expend substantial resources in developing an unsuccessful product, whether that lack of success is the result of our production of a non-viable\nproduct, a misidentified market, or a competitor\u2019s superior ability to meet our customers\u2019 requirements, operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe markets for our products are extremely competitive, and our competitors could use existing resource advantages to our detriment.\nThe markets in which we compete are subject to rapid and substantial changes in technology and are characterized by extensive research and development and intense competition. Our competitors and potential competitors may have greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, research and development and management resources than we do. These competitors could use their resources, reputations and ability to leverage existing customer relationships to give them a competitive advantage over us. They might also succeed in developing products that are more reliable and effective than our products, are less costly than our products or provide alternatives to our products.\nWe are dependent on the agricultural marketplace, which is affected by factors beyond our control.\nOur primary customers are in the agricultural and food production industries. Economic conditions affecting agricultural industries are cyclical and are dependent upon many factors outside of our control, including weather conditions, changes in consumption patterns or commodity prices. Any of these factors in the agricultural marketplace could affect our sales and overall financial performance.\nRISKS RELATED TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES\nOur quarterly or annual operating results are subject to significant fluctuations.\nWe have experienced, and may experience in the future, significant fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results. The mix of products sold and the acceptance of new products, in addition to other factors such as cost increases, could contribute to this variability. We operate with relatively little backlog and have few long-term customer contracts. Substantially all our product revenue in each period results from orders received in that period. In addition, our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectation of future revenue levels. Therefore, a shortfall in expected revenue could result in a disproportionate decrease in our net income.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be volatile. Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as other general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our common stock rapidly and unexpectedly, despite our operating performance. Factors that may impact the market price of our common stock include the factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K,\nas well as:\n\u2022\nPublic announcements (including the timing of these announcements) regarding our business, financial performance, acquisitions and prospects or new products or services, product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us;\n\u2022\nTrading activity in our stock, including transactions by us, our executive officers and directors, and significant stockholders; trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which we may be included, such as the S&P Mid-Cap\n400 Index; trading activity related to our inclusion in, or removal from, any stock indices; and short-interest in our common stock, which could be significant from time to time;\n\u2022\nInvestor perception of us and the industry and markets in which we operate, including changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by securities analysts; and whether or not we meet earnings estimates of securities analysts who follow us; and\n\u2022\nGeneral financial, domestic, international, economic and market conditions, including overall fluctuations in the U.S. equity markets, which may experience extreme volatility that, in some cases, is unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to obtain protection for the intellectual property utilized in our products; these products could be the subject of patent infringement challenges.\nOur success and ability to compete depends in part on our ability to obtain protection in the U.S. and other countries for our products by establishing and maintaining intellectual property rights capable of protecting our technology and products. Patent applications filed by us may not result in the issuance of patents or, if granted, may not be granted in a form that will be commercially advantageous to us. Even if granted, patents can be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or limit the length of time we have patent protection for our products. We also cannot assure that our nondisclosure agreements, together with trade secrets and other common law rights, will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and other proprietary information. Moreover, the laws of some foreign jurisdictions may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the U.S., and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. If we encounter such difficulties or we are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting our intellectual property rights domestically or in foreign jurisdictions, we could incur substantial costs and our business, including our business prospects, could be substantially harmed.\nFrom time to time, we have received notices alleging that our products infringe third-party proprietary rights. Whether the manufacture, sale or use of current products, or whether any products under development would, upon commercialization, infringe any patent claim cannot be known with certainty unless and until a court interprets the patent claim in the context of litigation. When an infringement allegation is made against us, we may seek to invalidate the asserted patent claim and/or to allege non-infringement\nof the asserted patent claim. For us to invalidate a U.S. patent claim, we would need to rebut the presumption of validity afforded to issued patents in the U.S. with clear and convincing evidence of invalidity, which is a high burden of proof. The outcome of infringement litigation is subject to substantial uncertainties, and also the testimony of experts as to technical facts upon which experts may reasonably disagree. Our defense of an infringement litigation lawsuit could result in significant expense. Regardless of the outcome, infringement litigation could significantly disrupt our marketing, development and commercialization efforts, divert management\u2019s attention and consume our financial resources. In the event that we are found to infringe any valid claim in a patent held by a third party, we could, among other things, be required to:\n\u2022\nPay damages, including up to treble damages and the other party\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees, which may be substantial;\n\u2022\nCease the development, manufacture, importation, use and sale of products that infringe the patent rights of others, through a court-imposed injunction;\n\u2022\nExpend significant resources to redesign our technology so that it does not infringe others\u2019 patent rights, or develop or acquire non-infringing\nintellectual property, which may not be possible;\n\u2022\nDiscontinue manufacturing or other processes incorporating infringing technology; and/or\n\u2022\nObtain licenses to the infringed intellectual property, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nAny development or acquisition of non-infringing\nproducts, technology or licenses could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. If we are required to, but cannot, obtain a license to valid patent rights held by a third party, we would likely be prevented from commercializing the relevant product, or from further manufacture, sale or use of the relevant product.\nWe are subject to substantial governmental regulation.\nA portion of our products and facilities are regulated by various domestic and foreign government agencies including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from products used to monitor and detect the presence of residues that are regulated by various government agencies. Furthermore, our growth may be adversely affected by the implementation of new regulations. The costs of compliance or failure to comply with any obligations related to these laws or regulations could adversely impact our business.\nWe are dependent on key employees.\nOur success depends, in large part, on members of our management team. Our loss of any of these, or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on us. We have not executed long-term employment agreements with any of these employees and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. Our success depends, significantly, on our ability to continue to attract and retain such personnel. We cannot assure that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified persons when required and on acceptable terms.\nOur business may be subject to product or service liability claims.\nThe manufacturing and distribution of our products or performance of our services involves an inherent risk of liability claims being asserted against us. Regardless of whether we are ultimately determined to be liable or our products are determined to be defective, we might incur significant legal\nexpenses not covered by insurance. In addition, product or service liability litigation could damage our reputation and impair our ability to market our products and services, regardless of the outcome. Litigation could also impair our ability to retain product liability insurance or make our insurance more expensive. Although we currently maintain liability insurance, we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms, or that such insurance will provide adequate coverage against all potential claims. If we are subject to an uninsured or inadequately insured product or services liability claim, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nChanging political conditions could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nChanges in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, results of elections, referendums or other political processes in certain markets in which our products are manufactured, sold or distributed could create uncertainty regarding how existing governmental policies, laws and regulations may change, including with respect to sanctions, taxes, the movement of goods, services, capital and people between countries and other matters. The potential implications of such uncertainty, which include, among others, exchange rate fluctuations, trade barriers and market contraction, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nClimate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our future operations from natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires or flooding. Such extreme weather conditions could pose physical risks to our facilities and disrupt operation of our supply chain and may impact operational costs. The impacts of climate change on global water resources may result in water scarcity, which could in the future impact our ability to access sufficient quantities of water in certain locations and result in increased costs. Concern over climate change could result in new legal or regulatory requirements designed to mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory requirements, we may experience increased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations and may adversely affect raw material sourcing, manufacturing operations and the distribution of our products.\nTax legislation could materially adversely affect our financial results and tax liabilities.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to tax-related\nexternal conditions, such as tax rates, tax laws and regulations, changing political environments in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions that impact tax examination, assessment and enforcement approaches. In addition, changes in tax laws including further regulatory developments arising from U.S. tax reform legislation and/or regulations around the world could result in a tax expense or benefit recorded to the Company\u2019s consolidated statement of earnings. In connection with guidance such as the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Integrated Framework provided by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), determination of multi-jurisdictional taxation rights and the rate of tax applicable to certain types of income may be subject to potential change. Due to uncertainty of the regulation changes and other tax-related\nfactors stated above, it is currently not possible to assess the ultimate impact of these actions on our financial statements.\nAlthough we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge. Income tax audits associated with the allocation of income and other complex issues may result in significant income tax adjustments that could negatively impact our future operating results.", "PERMNO": 75976, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "NEOG"}
