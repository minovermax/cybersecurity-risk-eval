{"cik": "1040792", "company": "Helios & Matheson Analytics Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to various risks that may materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. An investment in our common stock is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. In evaluating an investment in shares of our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information included in this report.\nThe risks described below are not the only risks we face. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occurs, or if additional risks and uncertainties later materialize that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, then our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our shares. The risks discussed below include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS\nWe rely on a concentrated client base for much of our revenue.\nWe rely on a small number of clients for a significant portion of our revenue. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our top four clients accounted for approximately 91.3% and 90.2%, respectively, of our revenue. If we were to lose any of these clients, we cannot assure you that they could be replaced quickly or at all. Our loss of any of these clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nOur ongoing investment in new technology is inherently risky, and could disrupt our business.\nTo remain competitive and grow we must continue to invest in new products and technologies and explore strategic investments. Our merger with Zone is an example of a new technology investment. There is no assurance that these investment endeavors will be successful or that the products and technologies developed by these investments will be well received by the users. As our competitors use or develop new technologies, competitive pressures may force us to invest in developing or implementing new technologies at a substantial cost. We cannot be certain that we will be able to develop or implement technologies on a timely basis or at a cost that is acceptable to us. If we fail to develop or implement new technologies in a cost-effective manner, our operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur industry is subject to rapid change.\nOur industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new product and service introductions, evolving distribution channels and changing customer demands. We must adapt to rapidly changing technological and application needs by continually improving our services as well as introducing new products and services to address user demands. Our success will depend in part on our ability to develop IT solutions to meet client expectations, and offer services and solutions that keep pace with continuing changes in IT, evolving industry standards and changing client preferences. If we are unable to keep up with technological changes and changes in industry standards, our business, reputation and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur industry is intensely competitive.\nThe market for IT consulting and data analytics services is intensely competitive, affected by rapid technological advances and includes a large number of competitors. Our competitors include the consulting divisions of the \u201cBig Four\u201d accounting firms, major offshore outsourcing companies, systems consulting and implementation firms, application software development firms, management consulting firms, divisions of large computer hardware and software companies, and niche providers of IT services. Many of these competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have. Competition imposes significant pricing pressures on us. If we are unable to compete successfully in our markets, our business and financial results will be materially adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property.\nWe rely upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights and the proprietary rights of third parties from whom we license intellectual property, but there can be no assurance that the steps we take in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights.\nInfringement on the proprietary rights of others could put us at a competitive disadvantage and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly.\nThird parties may claim that we violated their intellectual property rights. To the extent of a violation of a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may be prevented from operating our business as planned, and may be required to pay damages, to obtain a license, if available, or to use a non-infringing method if possible, to accomplish our objectives. Any of these claims, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel from our day-to-day operations. If such claims are successful, they could result in costly judgments or settlements.\nOur Indian subsidiary, Helios and Matheson Global Services Private Limited (\u201cHMGS\u201d), may have penalties levied against it for failing to file, on a timely basis, certain returns required by the Indian Companies Act, 2013.\nDuring 2015 our Indian subsidiary, HMGS, was not in compliance with regard to certain provisions of the Indian Companies Act, 2013 (the 2013 Act\u201d). These non-compliances related to the conduct of board meetings, appointment of a new auditor, scheduling the annual shareholders meeting, and filing certain returns, as required by the 2013 Act. As of December 31, 2016 HMGS was once again compliant with the 2013 Act, however, penalties may be levied against HMGS for its delay in filing the returns.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe sale of a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market by an institutional investor may have adversely affected, and could adversely affect in the future, the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nPrior to the sale of our Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Notes to an institutional investor on September 7, 2016 (the \u201cSeptember 2016 Notes\u201d), we had 2,330,438 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and on September 6, 2016 the closing price of our common stock was $9.46 per share. As of April 10, 2017 we had 5,861,191 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and the closing sale price of our common stock on that date was $2.71. Pursuant to the resale registration statement on Form S-3 (file number 333-213775) declared effective by the SEC on October 24, 2016, we initially registered 1,432,410 shares of common stock for the institutional investor in connection with the sale of the September 2016 Notes. We subsequently deregistered 544,703 shares of common stock from that registration statement after satisfying the September 2016 Notes in full by issuing 887,707 shares of common stock and payment in cash of $1,660 in interest. The institutional investor has since sold all 887,707 shares that it received upon conversion of the September 2016 Notes.\nWe also registered 3,926,293 shares of our common stock on Form S-3 (file number 333-215313 ) in connection with the sale of our Senior Secured Convertible Notes on December 2, 2016 to the same institutional investor (the \u201cDecember 2016 Notes\u201d), which registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on January 13, 2017. As of April 10, 2017, the institutional investor has sold or may have sold up to 383,046 shares of our common stock that it received upon conversion of the December 2016 Notes.\nOn March 9, 2017 we registered an additional 3,332,075 shares of our common stock on Form S-3 (file number 333-216569) for the same institutional investor in conjunction with the sale of Senior Secured Convertible Notes completed on February 8, 2017. The registration statement has not yet been declared effective by the Commission.\nOn October 24, 2016, the closing price of our common stock was $9.80 per share. On October 25, 2016, the closing price of our common stock was $7.11 per share. As noted above, on April 10, 2017 the closing price of our common stock was $2.71. Our stock price has generally declined since October 25, 2016 and continued sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market by the institutional investor, or the perception that such sales might occur, could continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile, and the market price of our common stock may decrease.\nThe per share price of our common stock may vary from time to time. For example, the closing price of our common stock during 2016 was as low as $1.08 and as high as $15.56. Market prices for securities of technology companies have historically been particularly volatile. The factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\nprogress, or lack of progress, in developing and commercializing Zone\u2019s RedZone Map technology;\n\u25cf\nour ability to recruit and retain qualified IT personnel;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the perception of investors and securities analysts regarding the risks to our business or the condition of our business;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our relationships with key clients;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the market valuation or earnings of our competitors or companies viewed as similar to us;\n\u25cf\nchanges in key personnel;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of debt;\n\u25cf\nthe granting or exercise of employee stock options or other equity awards;\n\u25cf\ngeneral market and economic conditions.\nIn addition, the equity markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the securities of technology companies for a number of reasons, including reasons that may be unrelated to our business or operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may result in a material decline in the market price of our common stock and you may not be able to sell your shares at prices you deem acceptable. In the past, following periods of volatility in the equity markets, securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against public companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial cost and the diversion of management's attention.\nWhile we are no longer a controlled company as defined by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5615(c)(1), HMIT and Theodore Farnsworth, our two largest shareholders (the \u201cMajority Stockholders\u201d), together own approximately 59.4% of our issued and outstanding voting securities. This concentration of stock ownership gives them substantial influence over us and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.\nAs the holders of approximately 59.4% of our common stock, the Majority Stockholders control the outcome of matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, the Majority Stockholders have significant influence over our management and affairs, particularly Mr. Farnsworth, who is our Chief Executive Officer and the Chairperson of our Board of Directors. This concentration of ownership might harm the market price of our common stock by:\n\u25cf\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change in control;\n\u25cf\nimpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us; or\n\u25cf\ndiscouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nRisks Related to Our Merger with Zone Technologies, Inc.\nThe failure to successfully develop and monetize the RedZone Map app may adversely affect our future results of operations.\nWe believe that the acquisition of Zone will result in certain benefits, most importantly expanding our business to offer the RedZone Map app, an innovative new product. However, we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, the failure to quickly complete the development of the RedZone Map app, the failure of consumers to use the RedZone Map app, an inability to successfully monetize the RedZone Map app and the loss of key personnel, particularly loss of the services of Theodore Farnsworth. We anticipate that we will be required to invest a significant amount of time and money in developing and monetizing the RedZone Map app which, if our efforts are unsuccessful, may not be recovered. Our failure to successfully develop and monetize the RedZone Map app may adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we fail to successfully integrate Zone into our internal control over financial reporting, the integrity of our financial reporting could be compromised which could result in a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.\nAs a private company, Zone was not subject to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with respect to internal control over financial reporting. The integration of Zone into our internal control over financial reporting may require significant time and resources from our management and other personnel and may increase our compliance costs. If we fail to successfully integrate these operations, our internal control over financial reporting may not be effective. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our ability to accurately report our financial results and the market\u2019s perception of our business and stock price.\nLoss of the services of Theodore Farnsworth could have a material adverse effect on Zone\u2019s operations.\nTheodore Farnsworth is Zone\u2019s founder and the developer of the RedZone Map app. Zone\u2019s success largely depends on Mr. Farnsworth\u2019s skills, experience and efforts. While we intend to enter into an employment contract with Mr. Farnsworth, he may terminate his employment at any time. The loss of Mr. Farnsworth\u2019s services could harm our business.\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide top quality products and services that are useful to users, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nConsumers have many map application choices like Google Maps and CrimeReports. While we believe that our offering of the RedZone Map app is unique given our advanced technology, crime data and navigation tool, there is no assurance that we may continue to incorporate the most advanced mapping and data technologies. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and personnel resources, which enable them to develop or use superior technologies and develop a user basis for their products and services that we are not able to afford. If our technologies become obsolete, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage.\nNew technologies that block mobile advertising could adversely affect Zone\u2019s business.\nZone\u2019s long-term business model depends greatly on advertising revenue derived from fees paid to us by advertisers in connection with the display of advertisements. New technologies have been developed, and are likely to continue to be developed, that can block the display of online or mobile advertisements. As a result, advertisement-blocking technology could in the future adversely affect our operating results.\nAny reduction in anticipated spending by advertisers could harm Zone\u2019s business.\nFuture advertising revenues are critical to Zone\u2019s business model and if advertisers\u2019 spending on online or mobile advertising is significantly reduced due to any political, economic, social or technological change or any other reason, our financial condition could be adversely affected.\nZone is reliant on crime data from several key providers. Should we experience difficulty in acquiring that data Zone\u2019s business could be adversely affected.\nAlthough our crime data comes from different sources, we have a few key providers. Should any of those providers discontinue providing data to us or we otherwise experience disruption in that pipeline, our operations may be adversely affected. If any of those providers require us to pay a much higher fee to use their data in the future, that could substantially drive up the costs of our services.\nZone\u2019s business depends on mobile technology and continued, unimpeded access to Internet and wireless services. Adverse changes to that access could harm our business.\nA few large companies provide wireless services to consumers. If our users\u2019 access to Internet and wireless services is interfered with or limited due to any political, economic, social or technological reason, we may not be able to make RedZone Map readily available to our users or may not be able to do so in an effective manner, including ensuring that the RedZone Map app will remain accessible within an acceptable load time. Failure to provide our services in a timely manner without interruption could generate consumer complaints and adversely affect our business.\nZone\u2019s business model depends on branding and marketing and failure to maintain and expand its user base or maintain a positive image could harm our business.\nWe believe that continued marketing efforts will be critical to achieve widespread acceptance of Zone\u2019s products. Our marketing campaigns may not be successful given the expense required. For example, failure to adequately maintain and develop Zone\u2019s user base could cause our future revenue growth to decrease. In addition, the RedZone Map app provides navigation recommendations based on Zone\u2019s database so that drivers can choose safer routes. If Zone is subject to any criticism for inaccurate information or an unsound recommendation and such criticism negatively impacts the public perception of our RedZone Map, that could harm our revenues and business.\nIncreased regulatory scrutiny, in particular, related to privacy and security issues may negatively impact Zone\u2019s business.\nAlthough we are not aware of any current or proposed federal, state or local laws or regulations that would have a material detrimental effect on the RedZone Map app, there may be increased legal and regulatory scrutiny on its data sources, technologies to process data and generate recommendations, the applicability of the recommendations and other aspects of the app. The increased legal and regulatory scrutiny may require us to make modifications or improvements to the current technologies we use or may otherwise increase our compliance costs, which may adversely affect Zone\u2019s business.\nIn particular, the regulatory framework for privacy and security issues is evolving worldwide and is likely to remain in flux for the foreseeable future. Various government and consumer agencies have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices. Practices regarding the collection, processing, storage, sharing, disclosure, use and security of personal and other information by companies offering online or mobile services is under increased public scrutiny. Zone\u2019s business, including its ability to operate and expand in the United States and internationally or on new technology platforms, could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are adopted, interpreted or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent with Zone\u2019s current business practices and that require changes to these practices, the design of Zone\u2019s website, mobile applications, products, features or Zone\u2019s privacy policy. In particular, the success of our business will be driven by our ability to responsibly use the data that we collect from our users, key suppliers and other sources. Therefore, our business could be harmed by any significant change to applicable laws, regulations or industry standards or practices regarding the storage, use or disclosure of data we collect, or regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of relevant persons for such use and disclosure is obtained. Such changes may require us to modify our products and features, possibly in a material manner, and may limit our ability to develop new products and features that make use of the data that we collect.\nWith an increasing user base and public awareness of the RedZone Map and with potential promulgation of new laws or regulations, we could be subject to claims, lawsuits and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.\nAlthough we are committed to making RedZone Map as high in quality as we are capable while maintaining full compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there is no assurance that we will not be the subject of claims, lawsuits or other proceedings arising from our technologies, products or services, especially if any new laws or regulations are promulgated which may greatly increase the risk of litigation by users or third parties. Litigation could be costly and could divert us from focusing on our business operations. If any litigation occurs and results in an adverse outcome, it could negatively impact our public image and brand and have a detrimental effect on our expansion plans and operating results.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property claims, which are costly to defend and could result in and/or limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.\nA third party may sue us for infringing its intellectual property rights. Likewise, we may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of third-party intellectual property rights. The cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to intellectual property rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and the litigation would divert our efforts from our business activities. If we do not prevail in this type of litigation, we may be required to pay monetary damages, stop commercial activities related to our products or obtain one or more licenses in order to secure the rights to continue marketing our products and services and using our technologies. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could limit our ability to continue some of our operations. In addition, a court may require that we pay expenses or damages.\nIf our security measures are breached, or if Red Zone Map is subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our products and services, users may curtail or stop using our products and services, or we may be subject to protracted litigation, which could harm our business.\nAny of our information security and processing systems, as well as third party data or network suppliers or our users, may experience damage or disruption of service from a number of causes, including power outages, computer and telecommunication failures, computer viruses, worms or other destructive software, internal design, manual or usage errors, cyber-attacks, terrorism, workplace violence or wrongdoing, catastrophic events, natural disasters and severe weather conditions. We may also become the target of malicious cyber-attack attempts. The security measures and procedures we, the third party suppliers and our users have in place to protect personal data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data breaches, cyber-attacks or system failures. Although we devote significant resources to our information security program and have implemented security measures to protect our systems and data, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these known or unknown threats.\nIf our security measures are breached, we may incur significant expenses in addressing and resolving the resulting problems. If we are sued in connection with any data security breach, we could be subject to protracted litigation. If unsuccessful in defending such lawsuits, we may have to pay damages or change our business practices, any of which could harm our business. In addition, any reputational damage resulting from a data breach, cyber-attack or system failure could decrease the acceptance and use of our products and services, which could harm our prospective future growth.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCING\nOur obligations to the holders of our Senior Secured Convertible Notes are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets, so if we default on those obligations, the note holders could foreclose on our assets.\nOur obligations under the Senior Secured Convertible Notes that we issued in September 2016 (one of which remains unpaid and outstanding and will mature on December 7, 2017), December 2016 and February 2017 and the transaction documents relating to those notes are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets. As a result, if we default under our obligations under the notes or the transaction documents, the holders of the notes, acting through their appointed agent, could foreclose on their security interests and liquidate some or all of these assets, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and could require us to curtail or cease operations.\nThe holders of our Senior Secured Convertible Notes have certain additional rights upon an event of default under the notes which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and could require us to curtail or cease or operations.\nUnder our Senior Secured Convertible Notes, the holders have certain rights upon an event of default. Such rights include (i) an increase in the interest rate to 12% per year for one month and 18% per year thereafter; (ii) the Alternate Conversion Price being adjusted to the lowest of (i) the applicable Conversion Price as in effect on the applicable Conversion Date of the applicable Alternate Conversion, and (ii) 75% of the lowest VWAP of the common stock for each of the 30 consecutive Trading Days ending and including the Trading Day of delivery or deemed delivery of the applicable Conversion Notice (such period, the \u201cAlternate Conversion Event of Default Measuring Period\u201d) (as adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, reclassification or similar transaction that proportionately decreases or increases the common stock during such Alternate Conversion Event of Default Measuring Period); and (iii) the holders having the right to demand redemption of all or a portion of the notes. At any time after certain notice requirements for an event of default are triggered, a holder of the notes may require us to redeem all or any portion of the note by delivering written notice. Each portion of the note subject to redemption would be redeemed by us in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds at a price equal to the greater of (i) the product of (A) the Conversion Amount to be redeemed multiplied by (B) the Redemption Premium (125%) and (ii) the product of (X) the Conversion Rate with respect to the Conversion Amount in effect at such time as the holder delivers an Event of Default Redemption Notice multiplied by (Y) the product of (1) the Redemption Premium multiplied by (2) the greatest Closing Sale Price of the common stock on any Trading Day during the period commencing on the date immediately preceding the event of default and ending on the date we make the entire payment required to be made under the notes. We may not have sufficient funds to settle the redemption price and, as described above, this could trigger rights under the security interest granted to the holders and result in the foreclosure of their security interests and liquidation of some or all of our assets.\nThe exercise of any of these rights upon an event of default could substantially harm our financial condition and force us to curtail or cease operations. For a more complete discussion of the Senior Secured Convertible Notes we issued on December 2, 2016 and February 8, 2017, please see the Current Reports on Form 8-K we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) on December 2, 2016 and December 8, 2016 and on February 7, 2017 and February 10, 2017.", "PERMNO": 85320, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "HMNY"}
