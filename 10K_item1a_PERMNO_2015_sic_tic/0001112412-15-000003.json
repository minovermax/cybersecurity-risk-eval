Risk Factors\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain matters discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d intended to qualify for the safe harbors from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). These forward-looking statements include statements that express a belief, expectation, or intention, as well as those that are not statements of historical fact, and may include projections and estimates concerning the timing and success of specific projects and our future production, revenues, income and capital spending. Our forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cpredict,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cpotential,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cgoal\u201d or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. We caution you not to rely on them unduly. In particular, this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements pertaining to the following:\n\u00b7\nour financial position and liquidity;\n\u00b7\nour business strategy;\n\u00b7\nrecent acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nbudgets;\n\u00b7\nprojected costs, savings and plans;\n\u00b7\nobjectives of management for future operations;\n\u00b7\nlegal strategies; and\n\u00b7\nlegal proceedings.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEndeavour International Corporation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. These risks, contingencies and uncertainties, which may not be exhaustive, relate to, among other matters, the following:\n\u00b7\nrisks and uncertainties associated with the Bankruptcy Cases and related liquidity concerns;\n\u00b7\nthe significant recent decline in, and volatility of, oil and gas prices;\n\u00b7\ndiscovery, estimation, development and replacement of oil and gas reserves;\n\u00b7\ndecreases in proved reserves due to technical or economic factors;\n\u00b7\ndrilling of wells and other planned exploitation activities;\n\u00b7\nour high level of indebtedness and debt service costs;\n\u00b7\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u00b7\nuncertainties related to drilling and production operations;\n\u00b7\ntiming and amount of future production of oil and gas;\n\u00b7\nability to flow our production through aging infrastructure in the U.K. North Sea that is owned by others;\n\u00b7\navailability and terms of capital;\n\u00b7\noperating costs such as lease operating expenses, administrative costs and other expenses;\n\u00b7\nour future operating or financial results;\n\u00b7\namount, nature and timing of capital expenditures, including future development costs;\n\u00b7\ncash flow and anticipated liquidity;\n\u00b7\navailability of drilling and production equipment;\n\u00b7\ncost and access to natural gas gathering, treatment and pipeline facilities;\n\u00b7\nenvironmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil spills and discharges of toxic gases;\n\u00b7\nbusiness strategy and the availability of acquisition opportunities; and\n\u00b7\nfactors not known to us at this time.\nAny of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations and the ultimate accuracy of a forward-looking statement. The forward-looking statements are not guarantees of our future performance, and our actual results and future developments may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. In addition, any or all of our forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may turn out to be incorrect. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known risks and uncertainties, as mentioned in this \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These cautionary statements qualify all forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEndeavour International Corporation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRisk Factors Related to Our Restructuring\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on October 10, 2014 and are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with the Bankruptcy Cases.\nFor the duration of the Bankruptcy Cases, our operations and our ability to execute our business strategy will be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy. These risks include but are not limited to:\n\u00b7\nour ability to continue as a going concern;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval with respect to motions filed in the Bankruptcy Cases from time to time;\n\u00b7\nour ability to develop, prosecute, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization with respect to the Bankruptcy Cases;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to terminate or shorten the exclusivity period for us to propose and solicit on a plan of reorganization, to appoint a trustee or to convert the Bankruptcy Cases to Chapter 7 cases;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain and maintain normal payment and other terms with customers, vendors and service providers;\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain licenses, leases and other contracts that are critical to our operations;\n\u00b7\nour ability to attract, motivate and retain key employees;\n\u00b7\nour ability to retain key vendors or secure alternative supply sources;\n\u00b7\nour ability to fund and execute our business plan, operations and financial commitments;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain acceptable and appropriate financing; and\n\u00b7\nthe cost of our restructuring efforts including professional fees, which reduce our available cash to operate our business.\nWe will also be subject to risks and uncertainties with respect to the actions and decisions of our creditors and other third parties who have interests in the Bankruptcy Cases that may be inconsistent with our plans.\nThese risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways. For example, negative events or publicity associated with the Bankruptcy Cases could adversely affect our relationships with our vendors and employees, as well as with our customers, lessors and licensors which in turn could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Also, pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, we need Bankruptcy Court approval for transactions outside the ordinary course of business, which may limit our ability to respond timely to events or take advantage of opportunities. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with the Bankruptcy Cases, we cannot predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 proceedings will have on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and there is no certainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs a result of the Bankruptcy Cases, realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities are subject to uncertainty. While operating under the protection of the Bankruptcy Code, and subject to Bankruptcy Court, approval or otherwise as permitted in the normal course of business, we may\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEndeavour International Corporation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nsell or otherwise dispose of assets and liquidate or settle liabilities for amounts other than those reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Further, a plan of reorganization could materially change the amounts and classifications reported in our consolidated historical financial statements, which do not give effect to any adjustments to the carrying value of assets or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary as a consequence of confirmation of a plan of reorganization.\nOur businesses could suffer from a long and protracted restructuring.\nOur future results are dependent upon the successful confirmation and implementation of a plan of reorganization. Failure to obtain both in a timely manner could adversely affect our operating results, as our ability to obtain financing to fund our operations may be harmed by protracted bankruptcy proceedings. The recent decline in commodity prices, and the resulting need to amend our plan of reorganization, has significantly increased the amount of time that we expect to need to obtain approval of our plan. If a liquidation or protracted reorganization were to occur, there is a significant risk that the value of our enterprise would substantially decline to the detriment of all stakeholders. Through December 31, 2014, we have spent $9.7 million in cash on professional and advisory fees. A protracted restructuring will likely continue that trend and significantly impact our cash flows.\nFurthermore, we cannot predict the ultimate amount of all settlement terms for the liabilities that will be subject to a plan of reorganization. Even after a plan of reorganization is approved and implemented, our operating results may be adversely affected by the possible reluctance of prospective lenders to do business with a company that recently emerged from bankruptcy proceedings.\nOur emergence from the Bankruptcy Cases is not assured.\nWe will not be seeking confirmation of the RSA Plan and there can be no assurance that an alternative plan of reorganization that might be proposed will be accepted by our creditors or approved by the Bankruptcy Court, so we urge caution with respect to existing and future investments in our securities.\nIt is unclear whether we would be able to reorganize our business and what, if any, distributions holders of claims against or interests in us, including holders of our secured and unsecured debt and of our equity, would ultimately receive with respect to their claims and interests. We will incur significant costs in connection with developing and seeking approval of an alternative plan of reorganization, which might not be supported by any of the current debt holders, various formal and informal creditor committees or other stakeholders. If an alternative reorganization could not be agreed upon, it is possible that we would have to liquidate our assets through a Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 proceeding in the U.S. or a proceeding in the U.K., in which case it is likely that holders of claims would receive substantially less favorable treatment than they would receive if we were to emerge as a viable, reorganized entity. There can be no assurance as to whether we will successfully reorganize and emerge from the Bankruptcy Cases or, if we do successfully reorganize, as to when we would emerge from the Bankruptcy Cases.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEndeavour International Corporation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain those employees or recruit additional qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the continuing efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if we lose any of these persons during or subsequent to the bankruptcy proceedings and are unable to attract and retain qualified replacements.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the terms of our indebtedness.\nWe have, and may continue to have, a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2014, we had total indebtedness of approximately $1,230.2 million, of which $790.2 million related to indebtedness of the Debtors.\nOur substantial indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations and has had and could continue to have other material adverse consequences for our business, including:\n\u00b7\nrequiring us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, which will reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other business activities;\n\u00b7\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including especially the recent significant decline in commodity prices;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u00b7\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions, dispositions or exploiting business opportunities;\n\u00b7\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds (even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity) or dispose of assets.\nWe also are, and expect to continue to be, required to comply with certain financial covenants and ratios. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flow from our operations and events or circumstances beyond our control. Our cash flow is highly dependent on the prices we receive for oil and natural gas, which declined significantly in recent months. If oil and gas prices remain at their current depressed levels, we currently anticipate a breach of our leverage covenant under our Amended Credit Agreement (see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d) applicable to our U.K. subsidiary in or about the third quarter of 2015. We are evaluating various alternatives with respect to our Amended Credit Agreement, but there is no certainty that we will be able to implement any alternatives or otherwise resolve our covenant issues. If an event of default occurs, and the lenders under the Amended Credit Agreement accelerate the maturity of any loans, we would not have sufficient liquidity to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness without new financing. Acceleration of\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEndeavour International Corporation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ndebt of this magnitude would likely result in a further reorganization, other restructuring or liquidation.\nIn addition, a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, the interest rate on our variable-rate debt will increase and will create higher debt service requirements, which would adversely affect our cash flow and could adversely impact our results of operations. While we may enter into agreements limiting our exposure to higher debt service requirements, any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk.\nWe may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the Bankruptcy Cases, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability.\nThe Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to confirmation and specified debts arising afterwards. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to October 10, 2014 and before confirmation of the plan of reorganization (i) would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the plan of reorganization or (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the plan of reorganization. Any claims not ultimately discharged by the Bankruptcy Court could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability.\nOur financial results may be volatile and may not reflect historical trends.\nWhile in bankruptcy, we expect our financial results to continue to be volatile as asset impairments, asset dispositions, restructuring activities, contract terminations and rejections and claims assessments may significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance is likely not indicative of our financial performance after the date of the bankruptcy filing. In addition, if we emerge from bankruptcy, the amounts reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements may materially change relative to historical consolidated financial statements, including as a result of revisions to our operating plans pursuant to a plan of reorganization.\nIn addition, if we emerge from bankruptcy, we may be required to adopt fresh start accounting. If fresh start accounting is applicable, our assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value as of the fresh start reporting date. The fair value of our assets and liabilities may differ materially from the recorded values of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, if fresh start accounting is required, our financial results after the application of fresh start accounting may be different from historical trends.\nOur shares are subject to risks associated with trading in an over-the-counter market.\nSecurities traded in the over-the-counter market generally have significantly less liquidity than securities traded on a national securities exchange, through factors such as a reduction in the number of investors that will consider investing in the securities, the number of market makers in the securities, reduction in securities analyst and news media coverage and lower market prices than might otherwise be obtained. As a result, holders of shares of our common stock may find it difficult to resell their shares at prices quoted in the market or at all. Furthermore, because of the limited market and generally low volume of trading in our common stock that could occur,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEndeavour International Corporation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nthe share price of our common stock could be more likely to be affected by broad market fluctuations, general market conditions, fluctuations in our operating results, changes in the markets perception of our business, and announcements made by us, our competitors or parties with whom we have business relationships.\nRisks related to access to capital and financing\nIf we are unable to fulfill commitments under any of our oil and gas interests, we will lose our interest, and our entire investment, in such interest.\nOur ability to retain oil and gas interests will depend on our ability to fulfill the commitments made with respect to each interest. We cannot assure you that we or the other participants in the projects will have the financial ability to fund these potential commitments, especially in light of the recent decline in commodity prices and our ongoing Bankruptcy Cases. If we are unable to fulfill commitments under any of our interests, we will lose our interest and our entire investment in such interest.\nA change of control may adversely affect our liquidity, require refinancing of certain debt instruments and trigger severance payments or accelerated vesting of equity awards.\nUpon certain specified change of control events, the lenders under our various debt facilities may cancel the facility and declare as due and payable any outstanding indebtedness, accrued interest and other outstanding fees. The terms of the indentures governing the 2018 Notes (as defined below) may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes if the proceeds from certain dispositions are not applied in a specific manner. We cannot assure you we would have sufficient financial resources to purchase the debt instruments for cash or repay the lenders upon the occurrence of a change of control or disposition. There can be no assurance that we would be able to refinance our indebtedness or, if a refinancing were to occur, that the refinancing would be on terms favorable to us.\nWe provide severance benefits through change in control agreements with Mr. Emme, Ms. Stubbs and Mr. Neilson. These agreements provide for severance compensation to be paid if employment is terminated under certain conditions, such as at the executive\u2019s election for \u201cgood reason\u201d following a change in control, as defined in the agreements. Additionally, our long-term incentive grant agreements provide for accelerated vesting of equity awards upon the occurrence of a change in control.\nOur development and exploration operations require substantial capital, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and gas reserves.\nThe oil and gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration, development, production and acquisition of oil and gas reserves. In the past, we have utilized cash flow from operations and access to the debt and equity markets to fund our capital requirements; the recent declines in commodity prices and our ongoing Bankruptcy Cases make it more difficult for us to\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEndeavour International Corporation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nfund our capital requirements in that manner. Our cash flow from operations and access to capital is subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u00b7\nthe level of natural gas and crude oil we are able to produce from existing wells and through infrastructure owned by others;\n\u00b7\nthe prices at which natural gas and crude oil are sold;\n\u00b7\nour oil and gas reserves;\n\u00b7\nuncertainties related to drilling and production operations;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and amount of capital expenditures, decommissioning costs and security obligations;\n\u00b7\nour ability to control the development efforts, costs and timing of our operations; and\n\u00b7\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves.\nRecently, global energy commodity prices have declined precipitously as a result of several factors including increased worldwide supplies, a stronger U.S. dollar, weather factors, and strong competition among oil producing countries for market share. Commodity prices have not rebounded to date, and it is unknown if or when they might recover. Specifically, prices for Brent have declined from approximately $115.00 per bbl in June 2014 to less than $47.00 per bbl in January 2015. Prices for NBP natural gas in January 2014 traded for approximately $11.00 per mcf compared to prices in January 2015 of approximately $7.00 per mcf. If our revenues decrease as a result of further or sustained lower oil and gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason or our capital expenditures increase as a result of operating difficulties, higher drillings costs or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels or to further develop and exploit our current properties, or for exploratory activity. In order to fund our capital expenditures, we may need to seek additional financing. Any future indebtedness we incur may contain covenants restricting our ability to incur additional indebtedness without the consent of the lenders.\nFurthermore, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing in the future on terms favorable to us, or at all. In addition, our existing debt contains restrictions on the incurrence of new debt. The failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to exploration and development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids reserves.\nSolely as a result of the uncertainties regarding our ability to obtain available financing in the future, we reclassified substantially all of our proved undeveloped reserves as probable undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2014.\nRisks related to executing our strategy and operations\nOur business involves many uncertainties and operating risks that can prevent us from realizing profits and can cause substantial losses.\nOur development activities may be unsuccessful for many reasons, including adverse weather conditions (such as storms in the North Sea), cost overruns, equipment shortages, geological\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEndeavour International Corporation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nissues and mechanical difficulties. These operating risks may result in a loss or delay of cash flows from production or require additional capital expenditures. Moreover, the successful drilling of a natural gas or oil well does not assure we will realize a profit on our investment. A variety of factors, both geological and market-related, can cause a well to become uneconomical or only marginally economical. In addition to their costs, unsuccessful wells hinder our efforts to replace reserves.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration and production activities, including well stimulation and completion activities such as hydraulic fracturing, involve a variety of operating risks, including:\n\u00b7\nfires;\n\u00b7\nexplosions;\n\u00b7\nblow-outs and surface cratering;\n\u00b7\nuncontrollable flows of natural gas, oil and formation water;\n\u00b7\nnatural disasters, such as severe storms, hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions;\n\u00b7\ninability to obtain insurance at reasonable rates;\n\u00b7\nfailure to receive payment on insurance claims in a timely manner, or for the full amount claimed;\n\u00b7\npipe, cement, subsea well or pipeline failures;\n\u00b7\ncasing collapses or failures;\n\u00b7\nmechanical difficulties, such as lost or stuck oil field drilling and service tools;\n\u00b7\nabnormally pressured formations or rock compaction; and\n\u00b7\nenvironmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline ruptures, encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials, and discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gases, or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment.\nIf we experience any of these problems, well bores, platforms, gathering systems and processing facilities could be affected, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations and receive the associated cash flows. We could also incur substantial losses as a result of:\n\u00b7\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u00b7\ndamage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u00b7\npollution and other environmental damage;\n\u00b7\nclean-up responsibilities;\n\u00b7\nregulatory investigation and penalties;\n\u00b7\nsuspension of our operations;\n\u00b7\nrepairs required to resume operations; and\n\u00b7\nloss of reserves.\nOffshore operations are also subject to a variety of operating risks related to the marine environment, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from severe storms, hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions. These conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production. As a result, we could incur substantial liabilities that could reduce or eliminate funds available for exploration, exploitation and acquisitions or result in the loss of property and equipment.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEndeavour International Corporation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur offshore operations involve special risks that could increase our cost of operations and adversely affect our ability to produce oil and gas.\nOffshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks specific to the marine environment, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions. These conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production. As a result, we could incur substantial liabilities that could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration, development or leasehold acquisitions, or result in loss of equipment and properties. Offshore drilling in the North Sea generally requires more time and more advanced drilling technologies, involving a higher risk of technological failure and usually higher drilling costs. Moreover, offshore projects often lack proximity to the physical and oilfield service infrastructure, necessitating significant capital investment in subsea flow line infrastructure. Subsea tieback production systems require substantial time and the use of advanced and very sophisticated installation equipment supported by remotely operated vehicles. These operations may encounter mechanical difficulties and equipment failures that could result in significant cost overruns. In addition, such mechanical difficulties are more difficult, expensive and time consuming to fix in an offshore environment. As a result, a significant amount of time and capital must be invested before we can market the associated oil or gas of a commercial discovery, increasing both the financial and operational risk involved with these operations. Because of the lack and high cost of infrastructure, some offshore reserve discoveries may never be produced economically.\nOur insurance may not protect us against business and operating risks, including an operator of a prospect in which we participate failing to maintain or obtain adequate insurance.\nOil and gas operations are subject to particular hazards incident to the drilling and production of oil and gas, such as blowouts, cratering, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, gas or well fluids, fires and pollution and other environmental risks. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations. We maintain insurance for some, but not all, of the potential risks and liabilities associated with our business. If a significant accident or other event resulting in damage to our operations, including severe weather, terrorist acts, war, civil disturbances, pollution or environmental damage, occurs and is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not currently operate all of our oil and gas properties. In the projects in which we own non-operating interests, the operator may maintain insurance of various types to cover our operations with policy limits and retention liability customary in the industry. The occurrence of a significant adverse event that is not fully covered by insurance could result in the loss of our total investment in a particular prospect and additional liability for us, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and prospects.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEndeavour International Corporation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nTo maintain and grow our production and cash flow, we must continue to develop and produce existing reserves and discover or acquire new oil and gas reserves to develop and produce.\nOur future oil and gas production is highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. Producing oil and gas reserves are generally characterized by declining production rates that vary depending on reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our reserves will decline unless we acquire properties with proved reserves or conduct successful development and exploration drilling activities. We accomplish this through successful drilling programs and the acquisition of properties. However, we may be unable to find, develop or acquire additional reserves or production at an acceptable cost or at all. Acquisition opportunities in the oil and gas industry are very competitive, which can increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, pursuing acquisitions.\nIf we are unable to find, develop or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production, our production rates will decline even if we drill the undeveloped locations that were included in our estimated proved and probable reserves. Our future oil and gas reserves and production, and therefore our cash flow and income, are dependent on our success in economically finding or acquiring new reserves and efficiently developing our existing reserves.\nOur expectations for future drilling and development activities will be realized over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of such activities.\nWe have identified drilling locations, prospects for future drilling opportunities and development plans for our commercial discoveries, including development, exploratory and other drilling and enhanced recovery activities. These drilling and development locations and prospects represent a significant part of our future drilling and development plans. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of factors, including the availability of capital, seasonal conditions, third-party operators, approval or other participants to drill wells and implement other work programs, availability of suitable drilling rigs, equipment and qualified operating personnel, regulatory approvals, negotiation of agreements with third parties, commodity prices, costs and drilling results. In particular, delays in obtaining regulatory approvals relating to our field development programs for our North Sea discoveries and operational issues can materially impact our ability to commence production at these discoveries which would materially impact our reserves, cash flow and results of operations. Furthermore, because of these uncertainties, we cannot give any assurance as to the timing of these activities or that they will ultimately result in the realization of proved reserves or meet our expectations for success. As such, our actual drilling and enhanced recovery activities may materially differ from our current expectations, which could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur drilling projects are based in part on seismic and other technical data, which cannot ensure the commercial success of a prospect.\nOur decisions to purchase, explore, develop and exploit prospects or properties depend in part on data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often uncertain. Seismic data and visualization techniques only\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEndeavour International Corporation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nassist geoscientists and geologists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable an interpreter to conclusively determine whether hydrocarbons are present or producible economically. In addition, the use of seismic and other advanced technologies may require greater predrilling expenditures than other drilling strategies. Because of these factors and the inherent uncertainties surrounding the evaluation of exploration prospects, we could incur losses as a result of exploratory drilling expenditures. Poor results from drilling activities would have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows, ability to replace reserves and results of operations.\nReserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate and any material inaccuracies in the reserve estimates or underlying assumptions of our assets will materially affect the quantities and present value of those reserves.\nEstimating oil and gas reserves is complex and inherently imprecise. It requires interpretation of the available technical data and making many assumptions about future conditions, including price and other economic factors. In preparing such estimates, projection of production rates, timing of development expenditures and available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data are analyzed. The extent, quality and reliability of these data can vary. This process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. If our interpretations or assumptions used in arriving at our reserve estimates prove to be inaccurate, the amount of oil and gas that will ultimately be recovered may differ materially and adversely from the estimated quantities and net present value of reserves owned by us.\nCertain of our U.K. oil fields are dependent upon tanker liftings to deliver oil production to buyers, which may result in fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations.\nWe record oil revenues using the sales method (i.e., when delivery has occurred). While certain of our U.K. fields produce into pipelines (causing revenue to be recorded consistently with such production), certain other fields are dependent upon tanker liftings to deliver oil production to buyers. As a result, our revenues from this oil production will fluctuate in connection with the frequency and volume of tanker liftings, which are factors not entirely within our control. Accordingly, the revenues from our oil production in the U.K. are expected to be more volatile than the associated physical production.\nActual production could differ significantly from forecasts.\nFrom time to time we provide forecasts of expected quantities of future oil and gas production. These forecasts are based on a number of estimates, including expectations of production decline rates from existing wells, outcomes from future drilling activity and assumptions relating to ongoing operations, downtime and maintenance of producing wells. Should these estimates prove inaccurate, actual production could be adversely impacted. Furthermore, downturns in commodity prices could make certain drilling activities or production uneconomical, which would also adversely impact production. We may also adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEndeavour International Corporation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe cost of decommissioning is uncertain.\nWe expect to incur obligations to abandon and decommission certain structures associated with our producing properties. To date, the industry has little experience of removing oil and gas structures from the North Sea, because few of the structures in the North Sea have been removed. Because experience is limited, we cannot precisely predict the costs of any future decommissions for which we might become obligated. Furthermore, we have seen a dramatic increase in costs related to decommissioning activities subsequent to incidents in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.\nWe are required to post collateral as security over certain of our decommissioning liabilities in the North Sea. If actual decommission or abandonment costs exceed our estimates or reserves to satisfy such obligations, or if we are required to provide a significant amount of collateral in cash or other security for these future costs, our financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. Moreover, applicable governmental authorities may increase the amount of collateral required as security for our North Sea operations. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to post sufficient collateral to secure such costs in the event of an increase in offshore collateral security requirements.\nRisks related to our business\nOil and gas prices are volatile, and a decline in oil and gas prices would reduce our revenues, profitability and cash flow and impede our growth.\nOur revenues, profitability and cash flow depend substantially upon the prices and demand for oil and gas. The markets for these commodities are volatile, and even relatively modest drops in prices can significantly affect our financial results and impede our growth. In addition, oil prices declined severely during the last quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015 and have not rebounded to date. It is unknown if or when they might recover. Prices for Brent have declined from approximately $115.00 per bbl in June 2014 to less than $47.00 per bbl in January 2015. Prices for NBP natural gas in January 2014 traded for approximately $11.00 per mcf compared to prices in January 2015 of approximately $7.00 per mcf.\nThe U.S. market is heavily impacted by the increased supply from shale drilling, which has served to depress natural gas and oil prices relative to the U.K. market. The price for oil and gas in the U.K. and U.S. is affected by local production as well as by the production from OPEC and other sources. The price in the U.S. is affected by differential pricing reflecting the cost of transportation from the point of production to deliver to the recognized national market hub, such as Henry Hub for gas or WTI for oil. Prices for oil and gas fluctuate in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil and gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control, such as:\n\u00b7\nglobal supply of oil and gas;\n\u00b7\nlevel of consumer product demand;\n\u00b7\ntechnological advances affecting oil and gas consumption;\n\u00b7\nglobal economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nprice and availability of alternative fuels;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEndeavour International Corporation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nactions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls;\n\u00b7\ngovernmental regulations and taxation;\n\u00b7\npolitical conditions in or affecting other oil-producing and gas-producing countries;\n\u00b7\nweather conditions;\n\u00b7\nthe proximity, capacity, cost and availability of pipeline and other transportation facilities; and\n\u00b7\nthe impact of energy conservation efforts.\nIn part because of recent declines, we expect that we may be unable to comply with certain of the financial covenants in our Amended Credit Facility. Please see \u201c-Risks related to access to capital and financing-Our debt levels could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\u201d Lower oil and gas prices may not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis, but significant or extended price declines may also reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically and reserves. A reduction in production could result in a shortfall in expected cash flows and require us to reduce capital spending or borrow funds to cover any such shortfall. Any of these factors could negatively impact our future rate of growth and ability to replace our production.\nWe operate internationally and are subject to political, economic and other uncertainties.\nWe currently have operations in the U.S. and U.K. and may expand our operations to other countries or regions. International operations are subject to political, economic and other uncertainties, including:\n\u00b7\nthe risk of war, acts of terrorism, revolution, border disputes, expropriation, renegotiation or modification of existing contracts, and import, export and transportation regulations and tariffs;\n\u00b7\ntaxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims;\n\u00b7\nexchange controls, currency fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our international operations;\n\u00b7\nlaws and policies of the U.S. affecting foreign trade, taxation and investment; and\n\u00b7\nthe possibility of being subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts in connection with legal disputes and the possible inability to subject foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts in the U.S.\nThe exploration, production and sale of oil and gas are extensively regulated by governmental bodies, which subject us to increased costs in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations as well as significant uncertainties due to the potential for such laws and regulations to change and evolve. Applicable legislation and regulations are under constant review for amendment or expansion. These efforts frequently result in an increase in the regulatory burden on companies in our industry and consequently an increase in the cost of doing business and decrease in profitability. Numerous governmental departments and agencies are authorized to, and have, issued rules and regulations imposing additional burdens on the oil and gas industry that often are costly to comply with and carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Production operations are affected by changing tax and other laws relating to the petroleum\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEndeavour International Corporation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nindustry, by constantly changing administrative regulations and possible interruptions or termination by government authorities.\nOil and gas mineral rights may be held by individuals, corporations or governments having jurisdiction over the area in which such mineral rights are located. As a general rule, parties holding such mineral rights grant licenses or leases to third parties to facilitate the exploration and development of these mineral rights. The terms of the leases and licenses are generally established to require timely development. Notwithstanding the ownership of mineral rights, the government of the jurisdiction in which mineral rights are located generally retains authority over the manner of development of those rights. As such, we may become subject to certain requirements, obligations and timelines as established or demanded by the holder of the oil and gas mineral rights and such requirements or obligations may adversely impact our operations, cash flow and capital plans.\nWe are subject to various governmental energy regulators\nEach jurisdiction where we do business has one or more regulatory bodies who regulate our oil and gas business. Examples include the U.K. Department of Energy, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, the Texas Railroad Commission, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission and the Louisiana Department of National Resources.\nThe consent of the regulatory bodies is generally required to acquire, develop, license, permit operation and produce oil and gas properties. Consent may be required to sell properties to third parties. Under certain circumstances, consent may be withheld or denied which could adversely impact or prohibit planned operations and activities.\nEconomic conditions in the U.S. and key international markets may materially adversely impact our operating results, which could hinder or prevent us from meeting our future capital needs.\nBecause global economic growth drives demand for energy from all sources, including fossil fuels, a lower future economic growth rate will result in decreased demand growth for our crude oil and natural gas production as well as lower commodity prices, which will reduce our cash flows from operations and our profitability and may adversely affect our ability to obtain funding for our projects.\nDue to these and other factors, we cannot be certain that funding will be available if needed, and to the extent required, on acceptable terms or at all. If funding is not available as needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to (i) meet our obligations as they come due, or (ii) implement our capital program, enhance our existing business, complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues, results of operations and prospects.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEndeavour International Corporation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCompetition for oil and gas properties and prospects is intense and some of our competitors have larger financial, technical and personnel resources that give them an advantage in evaluating, obtaining and developing properties and prospects.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment for reviewing prospects, acquiring properties, marketing oil and gas and securing trained personnel. Many of our competitors are major or independent oil and gas companies that have longer operating histories in our areas of operation and employ superior financial resources which allow them to obtain substantially greater technical and personnel resources and which better enable them to acquire and develop the prospects that they have identified. We also actively compete with other companies when acquiring new licenses or oil and gas properties. Specifically, competitors with greater resources than our own have certain advantages that are particularly important in reviewing prospects and purchasing properties. Competitors may be able to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Competitors may also be able to pay more for producing oil and gas properties and exploratory prospects than we are able or willing to pay. If we are unable to compete successfully in these areas in the future, our future revenues and growth may be diminished or restricted.\nThese competitors may also be better able to withstand sustained periods of unsuccessful drilling or downturns in the economy, including decreases in the price of commodities. Larger competitors may also be able to absorb the burden of any changes in laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would also adversely affect our competitive position. In addition, most of our competitors have been operating for a much longer time and have demonstrated the ability to operate through industry cycles.\nOur operations are sensitive to currency rate fluctuations.\nOur operations are sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the British pound. Our financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, are affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies.\nRisks related to environmental and other regulations\nWe are subject to environmental regulations that can have a significant impact on our operations.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of national, state, local and international laws and regulations governing the emission and discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and penalties as well as potential orders suspending or terminating our rights to operate. Some environmental laws to which we are subject to provide for strict liability for pollution damages and cleanup costs, rendering a person liable without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. In addition, we may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances such as oil and gas related products. Aquatic environments in which we\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEndeavour International Corporation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\noperate are often particularly sensitive to environmental impacts, which may expose us to greater potential liability than that associated with exploration, development and production at many onshore locations. Under certain environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to liability arising out of the conduct of operations or conditions caused by others, or for activities that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed. Such liabilities can be significant, and if imposed could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, current and future environmental regulations, including restrictions on GHG emissions of due to concerns about climate change, could reduce the demand for our products. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if this were to occur.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly requirements for oil and gas exploration and production activities could require us, as well as others in our industry, to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance which could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to comply with future laws and regulations to the same extent that we have complied in the past. Similarly, we cannot always precisely predict the potential impact of environmental laws and regulations which may be adopted in the future, including whether any such laws or regulations would restrict our operations in any area.\nGovernmental regulations to which we are subject could subject us to increased compliance costs, which could be substantial.\nOil and gas exploration, development and production are subject to various types of regulation by local, state and national agencies. Regulations and laws affecting the oil and gas industry are comprehensive and under constant review for amendment and expansion. These regulations and laws carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, adversely affects our profitability. In addition, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by the governments and/or agencies thereof.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws, and any determination that we violated such laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), as amended, and may be subject to similar worldwide anti-bribery laws including the UK Bribery Act 2010 that generally prohibit companies and their personnel and intermediaries from offering, authorizing, or making improper payments to government officials and to other persons or entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or securing some improper advantage in business. We do business and may do additional business in the future in countries and regions in which we may face, directly or indirectly, corrupt demands by officials, tribal or insurgent organizations, or private entities. As a result, we face the risk that an unauthorized payment or offer of payment could be made by one of our employees or intermediaries, even if such parties are not always subject to our control or are not themselves subject to the FCPA or\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEndeavour International Corporation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nother anti-bribery laws to which we may be subject. It is our policy to implement safeguards to prohibit these practices. However, existing safeguards and any future improvements may not prevent all such conduct, and it is possible that our employees and intermediaries may engage in conduct for which we might be investigated by U.S., UK, or other authorities, and held responsible. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws (either due to our acts or our inadvertence) may result in criminal and civil sanctions and could subject us to other liabilities in the U.S., U.K., and elsewhere. Even allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nFederal and state legislative regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations. We routinely utilize hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our natural gas well drilling and completion programs. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. However, the EPA recently asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the SDWA Underground Injection Control Program and issued permitting guidance under the SDWA for such activities. In addition, in May 2014, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to collect data on chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations under the Toxic Substances Control Act. To date, no other action has been taken. Further, the EPA has announced its intention to propose regulations under the CWA by sometime in 2015 governing wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and certain other natural gas operations.\nFurthermore, in April 2012, the EPA adopted regulations requiring the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from oil and natural gas production facilities by mandating the use of \u201cgreen completions\u201d for hydraulic fracturing activities. These regulations require the operator to recover rather than vent gas and natural gas liquids that return to the surface during well completion operations. In addition, the EPA is conducting a study of the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities on water resources and a draft final report is anticipated sometime in 2015 for peer review and for public comment. The results of this study or similar governmental reviews could spur initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise. From time to time, legislation has been introduced before Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process.\nIn addition, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. For example, Pennsylvania, and Colorado have each adopted a variety of well construction, set back, and disclosure regulations limiting how fracturing can be performed and requiring various degrees of chemical disclosure. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEndeavour International Corporation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIf new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing becomes regulated at the federal level as a result of federal legislation or regulatory initiatives by the EPA, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting requirements, and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the crude oil and natural gas that we produce.\nThere are a number of programs at the international, national, and local levels that aim to reduce GHG emissions. Changes to the existing laws or the enactment of new laws and regulations could increase our operating costs and reduce demand for our products. In the North Sea, depending on the scale of our operations, our offshore production facilities may be subject to compliance obligations under the E.U. ETS for GHG emissions. The E.U. ETS places a cap on GHG emissions from certain sources. Sources that emit above their applicable caps must purchase allowances in order to comply with the E.U. ETS. The E.U. has commenced the third phase of the E.U. ETS, running from 2013 to 2020, and therefore our activities in the North Sea are still potentially subject to the impacts of GHG limitations. While allowance prices on the E.U. ETS remain low, the E.U. has approved a proposal to increase allowances prices by deferring the marketability of allowances by withholding a number of allowances from auction, known as \u201cbackloading.\u201d Compliance with the above regulations may cause us to incur additional costs in our North Sea operations.\nIn the U.S., in response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs, present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish PSD construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet \u201cbest available control technology\u201d standards that will be established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA on a case-by-case basis. These EPA rulemakings could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. More recently, in January 2015, the Obama Administration announced that the EPA is expected to propose in the summer of 2015 new regulations that will set methane emission standards for new and modified oil and gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities as part of the Administration\u2019s efforts to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025.\nWhile Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emission\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEndeavour International Corporation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nby means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations. Substantial limitations on GHG emissions could also adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations.\nThe enactment of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nOn July 21, 2010, new comprehensive financial reform legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), was enacted that established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The Act requires the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d), the SEC and other regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation. In its rulemaking under the Act the CFTC has issued final regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Certain bona fide hedging transactions would be exempt from these position limits. The position limits rule was vacated by the United States District Court for the District of Colombia in September of 2012 although the CFTC has stated that it will appeal the District Court\u2019s decision. The CFTC also has finalized other regulations, including critical rulemakings on the definition of \u201cswap,\u201d \u201csecurity-based swap,\u201d \u201cswap dealer\u201d and \u201cmajor swap participant.\u201d The Act and CFTC Rules also will require us in connection with certain derivatives activities to comply with clearing and trade-execution requirements (or take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements). In addition new regulations may require us to comply with margin requirements although these regulations are not finalized and their application to us is uncertain at this time. Other regulations also remain to be finalized, and the CFTC recently has delayed the compliance dates for various regulations already finalized. As a result, it is not possible at this time to predict with certainty the full effects that the Act and CFTC rules will have on us and the timing of such effects. The Act also may require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties.\nThe Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts (including from swap recordkeeping and reporting requirements and through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivatives contract, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEndeavour International Corporation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nmay be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Act and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCertain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of proposed legislation.\nLegislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. federal income tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities, and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of this legislation or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, and any such change could have a material, adverse effect on us, our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our U.K. operations are subject to a variety of U.K. taxes, including the Petroleum Revenue Tax and a Supplemental Corporate Tax. The tax laws and rates are subject to change and the nature and amount of taxes owed has a direct effect on our financial results and U.K. production.\nRisks related to potential impairments\nA sustained period of lower oil and gas prices and other factors may result in ceiling test write-downs or other impairments.\nWe capitalize the costs to acquire, find and develop our oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting method. The net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves, plus the lower of cost or fair market value for unproved properties on a country-by-country basis. This quarterly test is called a \u201cceiling test.\u201d If net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed this ceiling test, we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings. Although a ceiling test write-down does not impact cash flow from operating activities, it does increase our net loss and stockholders\u2019 deficit. Once recorded, a ceiling test write-down is not reversible at a later date even if oil and gas prices increase.\nWe review the net capitalized costs of our properties quarterly, based on prices in effect (excluding the effect of our hedging contracts that are not designated for hedge accounting) as of\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEndeavour International Corporation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nthe end of each quarter or as of the time of reporting our results. We also assess investments in unproved properties periodically to determine whether impairment has occurred.\nThe risk that we will be required to further write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices are low or volatile. In addition, write-downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or our unproved property values, if estimated future development costs increase or we do not have the financial certainty to develop our proved undeveloped reserves. Oil prices declined severely during the last quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015. The Brent crude oil price per barrel for the period from January 1, 2014 to January 31, 2015 ranged from a high of $115.00 to a low of $47.00, a decrease of 59.1%, and the NBP natural gas price per mcf for the period January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014 ranged from a high of $11.00 to a low of $7.00, a decrease of 36.4%. We will likely experience further ceiling test write-downs or other impairments in the future. In addition, any future ceiling test cushion would be subject to fluctuation as a result of acquisition or divestiture activity.\nRisks relating to our common stock\nThe prices of our debt and equity securities are volatile and, in connection with our reorganization, holders of our securities may receive no payment, or payment that is less than the face value or purchase price of such securities.\nPrior to our announcement on September 2, 2014 that we had decided not to pay approximately $33.5 million in interest due on our Notes, the market price for our common stock was volatile. Following such announcement, the price of our common stock closed at less than $0.60 per share and was subsequently delisted from the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) on October 13, 2014. After our delisting, our common stock has been trading on the Over the Counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) market under the symbol \u201cENDRQ.\u201d Prices for our debt securities are also volatile and prices for such securities have generally been substantially below par following our bankruptcy filing.\nIn addition, following the delisting of our common stock from the NYSE, our equity securities are not listed on a public exchange. Accordingly, trading in our equity securities may be limited and holders of our securities may not be able to resell their securities for their purchase price or at all. We can make no assurance that the price of our securities will not fluctuate substantially in the future.\nUnder the terms of the RSA Plan (or any alternative plan of reorganization) , it is contemplated that all of the outstanding shares of our common and preferred stock and warrants would be cancelled, and holders of such securities would not be entitled to any payment in respect of their shares. In addition, new shares of our common stock may be issued. It is also possible that our obligations to holders of debt or preferred equity securities of Endeavour may be satisfied by payments to such holders that are less than both the par value of such securities and the price at which holders purchased such securities, or that shares of our common stock may be issued to certain of such holders in satisfaction of their claims. The value of any common stock so issued may be less than the par value or purchase price of such holders\u2019 securities, and the price of any such common shares may be volatile.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEndeavour International Corporation\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAccordingly, trading in our securities during the pendency of our Bankruptcy Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks to purchasers of such securities, as holders may not be able to resell such securities or, in connection with our reorganization, would receive no payment, or a payment or other consideration that is less than the par value or the purchase price of such securities.", "PERMNO": 90204, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "ENDRQ"}
