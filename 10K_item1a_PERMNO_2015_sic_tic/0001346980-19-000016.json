{"cik": "1346980", "company": "Chaparral Energy, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following are some of the important factors that could affect our financial performance or could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates contained in our forward-looking statements. We may encounter risks in addition to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may also impair or adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operation.\nOur actual financial results after emergence from bankruptcy may not be comparable to our historical financial information as a result of the implementation of the Reorganization Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby and our adoption of fresh start accounting.\nIn connection with the disclosure statement we filed with the Bankruptcy Court, and the hearing to consider confirmation of the Reorganization Plan, we prepared projected financial information to demonstrate to the Bankruptcy Court the feasibility of the Reorganization Plan and our ability to continue operations upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Those projections were prepared solely for the purpose of the bankruptcy proceedings and have not been, and will not be, updated on an ongoing basis and should not be relied upon by investors. Although the financial projections disclosed in our disclosure statement filed with the Bankruptcy Court represented our view based on then current known facts and assumptions about the future operations of the Company there is no guarantee that the financial projections will be realized. We may not be able to meet the projected financial results or achieve projected revenues and cash flows assumed in projecting future business prospects. To the extent we do not meet the projected financial results or achieve projected revenues and cash flows, we may lack sufficient liquidity to continue operating as planned and may be unable to service our debt obligations as they come due or may not be able to meet our operational needs. Any one of these failures may preclude us from, among other things: (a) taking advantage of future opportunities; (b) growing our businesses; or (c) responding to future changes in the oil and gas industry. Further, our failure to meet the projected financial results or achieve projected revenues and cash flows could lead to cash flow and\nworking capital constraints, which constraints may require us to seek additional working capital. We may not be able to obtain such working capital when it is required.\nIn addition, upon our emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted fresh start accounting, as a consequence of which our assets and liabilities were adjusted to fair values and the opening balance of our accumulated deficit upon emergence from bankruptcy was restated to zero. Accordingly, our future financial conditions and results of operations may not be comparable to the financial condition or results of operations reflected in the Company\u2019s historical financial statements.\nThe ability to attract and retain key personnel is critical to the success of our business. Any difficulty we experience replacing or adding personnel could adversely affect our business.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced professional personnel. The loss of any key executives or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We may need to enter into retention or other arrangements that could be costly to maintain. If executives, managers or other key personnel resign, retire or are terminated, or their service is otherwise interrupted, we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner and we could experience significant declines in productivity.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) may be limited as a result of our emergence from bankruptcy and new limitations under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201c2017 Tax Act\u201d).\nIn general, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) of 1986, as amended, provides an annual limitation with respect to the ability of a corporation to utilize its tax attributes, as well as certain built-in-losses, against future taxable income in the event of a change in ownership. Our emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings resulted in a change in ownership for purposes of the IRC Section 382. The Company analyzed alternatives available within the IRC to taxpayers in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in order to minimize the impact of the ownership change and cancellation of indebtedness income on its tax attributes. Upon filing its 2017 U.S. Federal income tax return, the Company elected an available alternative which would likely result in the Company experiencing a limitation that subjects existing tax attributes at emergence to an IRC Section 382 limitation that could result in some or all of the remaining net operating loss carryforwards expiring unused. Upon final determination of tax return amounts for the year ended December 31, 2017, including attribute reduction that occurred on January 1, 2018, the Company had total federal net operating loss carryforwards of $1.01 billion including $760.1 million which are subject to limitation due to the ownership change that occurred upon emergence from bankruptcy and $251.3 million of post-change net operating loss carryforwards not subject to this limitation. Because of the limitations that apply to these NOL amounts, it is possible that some portion of the Company\u2019s NOLs could expire unused.\nIn addition to the above, there are new limitations that apply to NOLs that arise in a taxable year ending after December 31, 2017. Unlike the law in effect prior to the 2017 Tax Act, the amendments to Section 172 disallow the carryback of NOLs but allow for the indefinite carryforward of those NOLs. In addition to the carryover and carryback changes, the 2017 Tax Act also introduces a limitation on the amount of post-2017 NOLs that a corporation may deduct in a single tax year under section 172(a) equal to the lesser of the available NOL carryover or 80 percent of a taxpayer\u2019s pre-NOL deduction taxable income.\nLimitations imposed on our ability to use NOLs to offset future taxable income may cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOLs to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.\nWe may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions and divestitures.\nIn the future we may make acquisitions of businesses that complement or expand our current business. We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. Even if we do identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms. As a result, our acquisition activities may not be successful, which may hinder our replacement of reserves and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, we may sell non-core assets in order to increase capital resources available for other core assets and to create organizational and operational efficiencies. We may also occasionally sell interests in core assets for the purpose of accelerating the development and increasing efficiencies in such core assets. Various factors could materially affect our ability to dispose of such assets, including the approvals of governmental agencies or third parties and the availability of purchasers willing to acquire the assets with terms we deem acceptable.\nOur producing properties are predominantly located in Oklahoma where our development opportunities, comprised of our inventory of drilling locations, are geographically concentrated in the STACK play in Oklahoma. We are therefore vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area.\nAt December 31, 2018, 78% of our proved reserves and 70% of our total equivalent production were attributable our properties located in the STACK, and we expect that concentration to increase as we have allocated substantially all of our oil and natural gas capital budget to this area in 2019. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, state and local political forces and governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, severe weather events, water shortages or other conditions or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil, natural gas or NGLs in the region.\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock and the price at which we may sell common stock in the future are subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nlimited trading volume in our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe concentration of holdings of our common stock;\n\u2022\nvariations in operating results;\n\u2022\nour involvement in litigation;\n\u2022\ngeneral U.S. or worldwide financial market conditions;\n\u2022\nconditions impacting the prices of oil and gas;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us and our competitors;\n\u2022\nour liquidity and access to capital;\n\u2022\nour ability to raise additional funds;\n\u2022\nevents impacting the energy industry;\n\u2022\nlack of trading market;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations; and\n\u2022\nother events.\nTrading of our common stock in the public market has been limited. Therefore, the holders of our common stock may be unable to liquidate their investment in our common stock.\nUpon our emergence from bankruptcy, our old common stock was canceled and we issued new common stock. From May 18, 2017, through May 25, 2017, our Class A common stock was quoted on the OTC Pink marketplace under the symbol \u201cCHHP\u201d. From May 26, 2017, through July 23, 2018, our Class A common stock was quoted on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets Group Inc. under the symbol \u201cCHPE\u201d. On July 24, 2018, we transferred our stock exchange listing for our Class A common stock from the OTCQB market to the New York Stock Exchange and began trading under the new ticker symbol \u201cCHAP.\u201d On December 19, 2018, all outstanding shares of our Class B common stock, converted into the same number of shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the terms of our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \"Certificate of Incorporation\").\nAlthough our common stock is listed on a U.S. national securities exchange, no assurance can be given that an active market will develop for our Class A common stock or as to the liquidity of the trading market for the common stock.\nHolders of our common stock may experience difficulty in reselling, or an inability to sell, their shares. In addition, if an active trading market does not develop or is not maintained, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, investors in our securities may not be able to resell their shares at or above the purchase price paid by them or may not be able to resell them at all.\nThere may be circumstances in which the interests of our significant stockholders could be in conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nFunds associated with Strategic Value Partners, LLC (\u201cSVP\u201d) and Contrarian Capital Management, L.L.C. (\u201cContrarian\u201d), currently own approximately 16.8% and 8.2%, respectively, of our outstanding Class A common stock. Each of SVP and Contrarian currently has a right to nominate one of our directors under its respective support agreement. Our Board currently consists of seven members, six of whom serve as independent directors. In addition, our Board currently has two vacancies resulting from the resignations of Mr. Geenberg and Mr. Morris, each effective March 11, 2019. Pursuant to its respective support agreement, each of SVP and Contrarian currently has a right to nominate an individual to fill the vacancy resulting from the resignation of its respective designee. Pursuant to the terms of the Company\u2019s support agreement with SVP, SVP has notified the Company that it will exercise its right to designate a replacement director to fill the vacancy resulting from Mr. Geenberg\u2019s resignation, subject to approval by the\nBoard. Circumstances may arise in which SVP and Contrarian may have an interest in pursuing or preventing acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions, including the issuance of additional shares or debt, that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in us or another company in which they invest. Such transactions might adversely affect us or other holders of our Class A common stock. Furthermore, the support agreements with SVP and Contrarian each provides for certain continuing nomination rights subject to conditions on share ownership. Our significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common shares because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with significant stockholders.\nWe may not be able to achieve our projected financial results or service our debt.\nAlthough our financial projections represent our view based on current known facts and assumptions about the future operations of the Company, there is no guarantee that the financial projections will be realized. Our financial performance is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to meet the projected financial results or achieve projected revenues and cash flows assumed in projecting future business prospects. To the extent we do not meet the projected financial results or achieve projected revenues and cash flows, we may lack sufficient liquidity to continue operating as planned or may be unable to service our debt obligations as they come due or may not be able to meet our operational needs. Any one of these failures may preclude us from, among other things: (a) taking advantage of future opportunities; (b) growing our businesses; or (c) responding to future changes in the oil and gas industry. Further, our failure to meet the projected financial results or achieve projected revenues and cash flows could lead to cash flow and working capital constraints, which constraints may require us to seek additional working capital. We may not be able to obtain such working capital when it is required.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our long-term indebtedness, we will be in default and, as a result:\n\u2022\ndebt holders, including the holders of our Senior Notes, could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable;\n\u2022\nwe may be in default under our master derivative contracts and counter-parties could demand early termination;\n\u2022\nthe lenders under our New Credit Facility could terminate their commitments to loan us money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings; and\n\u2022\nwe could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nAny inability to maintain our current derivative positions in the future specifically could result in financial losses or could reduce our income and cash flows.\nOur results of operations, financial condition and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of, and demand for, oil and natural gas. These commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties. To mitigate a portion of this exposure, we enter into commodity price swaps, collars, put options, enhanced swaps and basis protection swaps. While the use of derivative contracts may limit or reduce the downside risk of adverse price movements, their use also may limit future benefits from favorable price movements and expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances. Those circumstances include instances where our production is less than the volume subject to derivative contracts, there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery points assumed in the derivative transactions or there are issues with regard to the legal enforceability of such instruments.\nA decline in oil and gas prices may adversely affect our financial condition, financial results, liquidity, cash flows, access to capital and ability to grow.\nOur future financial condition, revenues, results of operations, rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend primarily upon the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production. Oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future, especially given current geopolitical conditions. This price volatility also affects the cash flow we will have available for capital expenditures as well as our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. The prices for oil and natural gas are subject to a variety of factors that are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe level of consumer demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\ncommodity processing, gathering and transportation availability, and the availability of refining capacity;\n\u2022\nthe price and level of foreign imports of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the members of OPEC to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u2022\nthe supply of other inputs necessary to our production;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuel sources;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\nfinancial and commercial market uncertainty;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions or hostilities in oil and natural gas producing regions, including the Middle East and South America; and\n\u2022\nworldwide economic conditions.\nThese factors and the volatility of the energy markets generally make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and gas price movements with any certainty. From mid-2014 through 2016, oil and natural gas prices declined significantly, due in large part to increasing supplies and weakening demand growth. Although oil prices increased from 2017 into the 2018, they have since declined sharply towards the end of 2018 into 2019.\nExtended periods of lower oil and natural gas prices will reduce our revenue but also will reduce the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce economically, and as a result, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and reserves. During periods of low commodity prices we may shut in or curtail production from additional wells and defer drilling new wells, challenging our ability to produce at commercially paying quantities required to hold our leases. A reduction in production could result in a shortfall in our expected cash flows and require us to reduce our capital spending or borrow funds to cover any such shortfall. Any of these factors could negatively impact our ability to replace our production and our future rate of growth.\nA decline in prices from current levels may lead to additional write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties in the future which could negatively impact results of operations.\nWe utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our oil and natural gas properties. Under this method, all costs incurred for both productive and nonproductive properties are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis using the units-of-production method. However, these capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of estimated future net revenues attributable to proved oil and natural gas reserves discounted at 10% net of tax considerations, plus the market value of unproved properties not being amortized. The full cost ceiling is evaluated at the end of each quarter using the SEC prices for oil and natural gas in effect at that date. A write-down of oil and natural gas properties does not impact cash flow from operating activities, but does reduce net income. Once incurred, a write-down of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date. We recorded ceiling test write-downs of $20 million, $42 million and $281 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The volatility of oil and natural gas prices and other factors, without mitigating circumstances, could require us to further write down capitalized costs and incur corresponding noncash charges to earnings. Since the prices used in the cost ceiling are based on a trailing twelve-month period, the full impact of a sudden price decline is not recognized immediately.\nA significant portion of total proved reserves as of December 31, 2018 are undeveloped, and those reserves may not ultimately be developed.\nAs of December 31, 2018, approximately 41% of our estimated proved reserves (by volume) were undeveloped. These reserve estimates reflect our plans to make significant capital expenditures to convert our proved undeveloped reserves into proved developed reserves at a total estimated undiscounted cost of $406.0 million. You should be aware that actual development costs may exceed estimates, development may not occur as scheduled and results may not be as estimated. If we choose not to develop our proved undeveloped reserves, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop them, we will be required to remove the associated volumes from our reported proved reserves.\nThe actual quantities and present value of our proved reserves may be lower than we have estimated.\nEstimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves is a complex process. The quantities and values of our proved reserves in the projections are only estimates and subject to numerous uncertainties. The accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation. These estimates depend on assumptions regarding quantities and production rates of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves, future prices for oil and natural gas, timing and amounts of development expenditures and operating expenses, all of which will vary from those assumed in our estimates. If the variances in these assumptions are significant, many of which are based upon extrinsic events we cannot control, they could significantly affect these estimates. Any significant variance from the assumptions used could result in the actual amounts of oil and natural gas ultimately recovered and future net cash flows being materially different from the estimates in our reserves reports. In addition, results of drilling, testing, production, and changes in prices after the date of the estimates of our reserves may result in substantial downward revisions. These estimates may not accurately predict the present value of future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas reserves.\nYou should not assume that the present values referred to in this report represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. The timing of production and expenses associated with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect both the timing of actual future net cash flows from our proved reserves and their present value. In accordance with requirements of the SEC, the estimates of present values are based on a twelve-month average price, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the twelve-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of these estimates. Our December 31, 2018, reserve report used SEC pricing of $3.10 per Mcf for natural gas and $65.56 per Bbl for oil.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our New Credit Facility and Senior Notes.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had total indebtedness of $320.6 million. Our current and future indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nour high level of indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;\n\u2022\nthe restrictions imposed on the operation of our business by the terms of our debt agreements may hinder our ability to take advantage of strategic opportunities to grow our business;\n\u2022\nthe restrictions imposed on the operation of our business by the terms of our debt agreements may limit management\u2019s discretion in operating our business and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, restructuring, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired, which could be exacerbated by further volatility in the credit markets;\n\u2022\nwe must use a material portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest on our Senior Notes, borrowings under our New Credit Facility and our other indebtedness, which will reduce the funds available to us for operations and other purposes;\n\u2022\nour high level of indebtedness could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt;\n\u2022\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited;\n\u2022\nour high level of indebtedness makes us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business;\n\u2022\nwe may be vulnerable to interest rate increases, as our borrowings under our New Credit Facility are at variable rates; and\n\u2022\nour substantial level of indebtedness may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing due to applicable financial and restrictive covenants in our debt arrangements.\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and ability to satisfy our obligations under our debt agreement.\nRestrictive covenants in our New Credit Facility and Senior Notes could limit our growth and our ability to finance our operations, fund our capital needs, respond to changing conditions and engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests.\nOur New Credit Facility and Senior Notes imposes operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability and that of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake investments or loans;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nconsummate mergers and similar fundamental changes;\n\u2022\nmake restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake investments in unrestricted subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates.\nThese restrictions could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to plan for, or react to, market conditions, to meet capital needs or otherwise to restrict our activities or business plan; and\n\u2022\nadversely affect our ability to finance our operations, enter into acquisitions or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nOur New Credit Facility includes provisions that require mandatory prepayment of outstanding borrowings and/or a borrowing base redetermination when we make asset dispositions over a certain threshold, which could limit our ability to generate liquidity from asset sales. Also, our New Credit Facility and Senior Notes require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests. Our ability to comply with these ratios and financial condition tests may be affected by events beyond our control and, as a result, we may be unable to meet these ratios and financial condition tests. These financial ratio restrictions and financial condition tests could limit our ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a continued downturn in our business or a downturn in the economy in general, or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. Our potential inability to meet financial covenants could require us to refinance or amend such obligations resulting in the payment of consent fees or higher interest rates, or require us to raise additional capital at an inopportune time or on terms not favorable to us.\nA breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios or financial condition tests could result in a default under our New Credit Facility or Senior Notes. A default under our New Credit Facility or Senior Notes , if not cured or waived, could result in acceleration of all indebtedness outstanding thereunder, which in turn would trigger cross-acceleration and cross-default rights under our other debt.\nIf our debt is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If our debt is in default for any reason, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our New Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on such variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. Assuming a constant debt level under our New Credit Facility of $325.0 million, equal to our borrowing base at December 31, 2018, the cash flow impact for a 12-month period resulting from a 100 basis point change in the variable component of our interest rate would be $3.3 million.\nFuture legislative changes may increase the gross production tax charged on our oil and natural gas production.\nDue to significant budget shortfalls in Oklahoma in recent years, legislation has been introduced which increased the Gross Production Tax (\u201cGPT\u201d) applicable to the oil and natural gas we produce. In May and November 2017, the Oklahoma legislature passed bills that effectively increased production taxes on certain producing wells and units in the state. The legislative change in May 2017, which took effect in July 2017, increased the rate on certain horizontal wells spudded on or prior to July 1, 2015 from 1% to 4%. This was followed by a legislative change in November 2017, which took effect in December 2017, which further increased the rate on the aforementioned horizontal wells from 4% to 7%. In March 2018, the Oklahoma legislature approved a production tax increase from 2% to 5% during the first three years of production on horizontal wells spudded after July 1, 2015. Subsequent to these legislative changes, production from new Oklahoma wells are now taxed at a 5% rate for the first 36 months of production and at 7% thereafter. The passage of any further legislation or ballot initiatives that would increase the tax burden on all of our oil and gas production occurring in the State of Oklahoma would negatively affect our net revenues, our financial condition, and results of operations.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense and many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do.\nWe operate in the highly competitive areas of oil and natural gas production, acquisition, development, and exploration and face intense competition from both major and other independent oil and natural gas companies:\n\u2022\nseeking to acquire desirable producing properties or new leases for future development or exploration; and\n\u2022\nseeking to acquire similar equipment and expertise that we deem necessary to operate and develop our properties.\nMany of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours, and some of them are fully integrated oil companies. These companies may be able to pay more for development prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. Our ability to develop our oil and natural gas properties and to acquire additional properties in the future will\ndepend upon our ability to successfully conduct operations, select suitable prospects and consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment.\nWe can also be affected by competition for drilling rigs and the availability of related equipment. In the past, the oil and natural gas industry has experienced shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel, which have delayed developmental drilling and other exploitation activities and have caused significant price increases. We are unable to predict when, or if, such shortages may again occur or how they would affect our development and exploitation program.\nEnergy conservation measures or initiatives that stimulate demand for alternative forms of energy could reduce the demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce.\nFuel conservation measures, climate change initiatives, governmental requirements for renewable energy resources, increasing consumer demand for alternative forms of energy, and technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce. The potential impact of changing demand for crude oil and natural gas services and products could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nDrilling wells is speculative and capital intensive.\nDeveloping and exploring properties for oil and natural gas requires significant capital expenditures and involves a high degree of financial risk, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. The budgeted costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often exceeded and can increase significantly when drilling costs rise. If our cash flow from operations is not sufficient to fund our capital expenditure budget, we may not be able to access additional bank debt or other methods of financing on commercially reasonable terms to meet these requirements. If revenue were to decrease as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices or decreased production, and our access to capital were limited, we would have a reduced ability to replace our reserves, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, drilling may be unsuccessful for many reasons, including title problems, weather, cost overruns, equipment shortages, and mechanical difficulties. Moreover, the successful drilling or completion of an oil or natural gas well does not ensure a profit on investment. Exploratory wells bear a much greater risk of loss than development wells.\nIf we are not able to replace reserves, we may not be able to sustain production.\nOur future success depends largely upon our ability to find, develop, or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Unless we replace the reserves we produce through successful development, exploration or acquisition activities, our proved reserves and production will decline over time. Recovery of such reserves will require significant capital expenditures and successful drilling. Our December 31, 2018, reserve estimates reflect that our production rate on current proved developed producing reserve properties will decline at annual rates of approximately 25%, 17%, and 13% for the next three years. Thus, our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically discovering or acquiring additional recoverable reserves.\nDevelopment and exploration drilling may not result in commercially productive reserves.\nDrilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that commercially productive reservoirs will not be encountered. We cannot assure you that new wells we drill will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or may be economically recovered and/or produced. Drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit at then-realized prices after deducting drilling, operating and other costs. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. These risks are magnified when operating in an environment of low crude oil prices. Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022\ntitle problems;\n\u2022\nsurface access restrictions;\n\u2022\npressure or lost circulation in formations;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022\ndecline in commodity prices;\n\u2022\nlimited availability of financing on acceptable terms;\n\u2022\npolitical events, public protests, civil disturbances, terrorist acts or cyber-attacks;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\ncompliance with environmental and other governmental requirements; and\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, equipment and services.\nIf, for any reason, we are unable to economically recover reserves through our exploration and drilling activities, our results of operations, cash flows, growth, and reserve replenishment may be materially affected.\nOil and natural gas drilling and production operations can be hazardous and may expose us to uninsurable losses or other liabilities.\nOil and natural gas operations are subject to many risks, including well blowouts, cratering, explosions, pipe failure, fires, formations with abnormal pressures, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine or well fluids, hydraulic fracturing fluids, toxic gas or other\npollutants and other environmental and safety hazards and risks. Our drilling operations involve risks from high pressures and from mechanical difficulties such as stuck pipes, collapsed casings and separated cables. If any of these events occur, we could sustain substantial losses as a result of:\n\u2022\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u2022\nsevere damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022\npollution or other environmental damage;\n\u2022\nremediation and cleanup responsibilities;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations and administrative, civil and criminal penalties;\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation; and\n\u2022\ninjunctions or other proceedings that suspend, limit or prohibit operations.\nOur liability for environmental hazards sometimes includes those created on properties prior to the date we acquired or leased them. While we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks described above, our insurance may not be adequate to cover any or all resulting losses or liabilities. Moreover, if we experience more insurable events, our annual premiums may increase further or we may not be able to obtain any such insurance on commercially reasonable terms. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, certain risks may not be fully insurable. The occurrence of, or failure or inability by us to obtain or maintain adequate insurance coverage for, any of the events listed above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as our growth, exploration, and employee recruitment activities.\nMulti-well pad drilling and project development may result in volatility in our operating results.\nWe have commenced drilling multi-well spacing test patterns in our STACK play. These projects, which are capital intensive, involve horizontal multi-well pad drilling, tighter drill spacing and completions techniques that evolve over time as learnings are captured and applied. The use of this technique may increase the risk of unintentional communication with other adjacent wells and the potential to reduce total recoverable reserves from the reservoir. Problems affecting a single well could adversely affect production from all of the wells on the pad or in the entire project. Furthermore, additional time is required to drill and complete multiple wells before any such wells begin producing. As a result, multi-well pad drilling and project development can cause delays in the scheduled commencement of production or interruptions in ongoing production. These delays or interruptions may cause declines or volatility in our operating results due to timing. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues and could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not have sufficient funds to repay bank borrowings if required as a result of a borrowing base redetermination.\nAvailability under our New Credit Facility is subject to a borrowing base, set at $325.0 million as of December 2018, and which is redetermined by the banks semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. In addition, the banks may request a borrowing base redetermination once between each scheduled redetermination. Dispositions of our oil and natural gas assets, early terminations of our derivative contracts, or incurrence of permitted senior additional debt may also trigger automatic reductions in our borrowing base. If the outstanding borrowings under our New Credit Facility were to exceed the borrowing base as a result of a redetermination, we would be required to eliminate this deficiency. Within 10 days after receiving notice of the new borrowing base, we would be required to make an election: (1) to repay the deficiency in a lump sum within 45 days or (2) commencing within 30 days to repay the deficiency in equal monthly installments over a six -month period or (3) to submit within 45 days additional oil and gas properties we own for consideration in connection with the determination of the borrowing base sufficient to eliminate the deficiency or (4) any combination of repayment as provided in the preceding three elections. If we are forced to repay a portion of our bank borrowings, we may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments. If we do not have sufficient funds and are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing, we may have to sell significant assets. Asset sales may also reduce available collateral and availability under the New Credit Facility and could have a material adverse effect on our business and\nfinancial results. In addition, we cannot be certain that our cash flow will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations.\nResolution of litigation could materially affect our financial position and results of operations or result in dilution to existing stockholders.\nWe have been named as a defendant in certain lawsuits. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings. In some of these suits, our liability for potential loss upon resolution may be mitigated by insurance coverage. To the extent that potential exposure to liability is not covered by insurance or insurance coverage is inadequate, we could incur losses that could be material to our financial position or results of operations in future periods. Additionally, we are parties to certain litigation initiated prior to our emergence from bankruptcy, and pursuant to the Reorganization Plan, liability arising under judgment or settlement related to certain of these claims would be satisfied through the issuance of stock which could result in dilution to existing stockholders. We may also become involved in litigation over certain issues related to the Reorganization Plan, including the proposed treatment of certain claims thereunder. The outcome of such litigation could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in future periods.\nWe cannot control the activities on properties we do not operate and we are unable to ensure the proper operation and profitability of these non-operated properties.\nWe do not operate all of the properties in which we have an interest. As a result, we have limited ability to exercise influence over, and control the risks associated with, the operation of these properties. The success and timing of drilling and development activities on our partially owned properties operated by others therefore will depend upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the operator\u2019s:\n\u2022\ntiming and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nexpertise and diligence in adequately performing operations and complying with applicable agreements;\n\u2022\nfinancial resources;\n\u2022\ninclusion of other participants in drilling wells; and\n\u2022\nuse of technology.\nAs a result of any of the above or an operator\u2019s failure to act in ways that are in our best interest, our allocated production revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf the third parties we rely on for gathering and distributing our oil and natural gas are unable to meet our needs for such services and facilities, our future exploration and production activities could be adversely affected.\nThe marketability of our production depends upon the proximity of our reserves to, and the capacity of, third-party facilities and third-party services, including oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines, trucking or terminal facilities, and refineries or processing facilities. The lack of available capacity on such third-party systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production. Further, such third parties are subject to federal and state regulation of the production and transportation of oil and natural gas. If such third parties are unable to comply with such regulations and we are unable to replace such service and facilities providers, we may be required to shut-in producing wells or delay or discontinue development plans for our properties. A shut-in, delay or discontinuance could adversely affect our financial conditions.\nLimitations or restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur operations require significant amounts of water for drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to obtain water from local sources may require us to find remote sources. In addition, treatment and disposal of such water after use is becoming more highly regulated and restricted. Thus, costs for obtaining and disposing of water could increase significantly, potentially limiting our ability to engage in hydraulic fracturing. This could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental and safety regulations, which can adversely affect the cost, manner, and feasibility of doing business.\nOur exploration, production, and marketing operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, tribal, state, and local laws and regulations governing, among other things: land use restrictions, drilling bonds and other financial responsibility requirements, reporting and other requirements with respect to emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants, unitization and pooling of properties, habitat and threatened and endangered species protection, reclamation and remediation, well stimulation processes, produced water disposal, safety precautions, operational reporting, and tax requirements. These laws, regulations and related public policy considerations affect the costs, manner, and feasibility of our operations and require us to make significant expenditures in order to comply. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal\npenalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions that could limit or prohibit our operations. In addition, some of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several, strict liability for contamination resulting from spills, discharges, and releases of substances on, under or from our properties and facilities, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. Under such laws and regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed substances and property contamination, including wastes disposed or released by prior owners or operators. Changes in, or additions to, environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes or additions that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, cleanup or other environmental protection requirements could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nFuture legislation may result in the elimination of certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development. Additionally, future federal and state legislation may impose new or increased taxes or fees on oil and natural gas extraction.\nIn recent years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. federal and state income tax laws, including the elimination of certain U.S. federal income tax benefits and deductions currently available to oil and gas companies. Such changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the increase of the amortization period of geological and geophysical expenses, (iii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs; and (iv) the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities. Moreover, other generally applicable features of the 2017 Tax Act, such as changes to the deductibility of interest expense, the carryback, carryforward and limitation on the use of post 2017 net operating losses and the cost recovery rules could impact our income taxes and resulting operating cash flow. Additionally, legislation could be enacted that imposes new fees or increases the taxes on oil and natural gas extraction, which could result in increased operating costs and/or reduced consumer demand for petroleum products and thereby affect the prices we receive for our commodity products.\nPotential legislative and regulatory actions could negatively affect our business.\nIn addition to the SDWA and other potential regulations on hydraulic fracturing practices, numerous other legislative and regulatory proposals affecting the oil and gas industry have been introduced, are anticipated to be introduced, or are otherwise under consideration, by Congress, state legislatures and various federal and state agencies. Among these proposals are: (1) climate change/carbon tax legislation introduced in Congress, and EPA regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and (2) legislation introduced in Congress to impose new taxes on, or repeal various tax deductions available to, oil and gas producers, such as the current tax deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, which deductions, if eliminated, could raise the cost of energy production, reduce energy investment and affect the economics of oil and gas exploration and production activities. Any of the foregoing described proposals could affect our operations, and the costs thereof. The trend toward stricter standards, increased oversight and regulation and more extensive permit requirements, along with any future laws and regulations, could result in increased costs or additional operating restrictions which could have an effect on demand for oil and natural gas or prices at which it can be sold. However, until such legislation or regulations are enacted or adopted into law and thereafter implemented, it is not possible to gauge their impact on our future operations or their results of operations and financial condition.\nFederal, state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and waste water injector wells could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nOur hydraulic fracturing operations are a significant component of our business, and it is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly oil and natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, although no rule was ever finalized, in May 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on the development of regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. Beginning in August 2012, the EPA issued a series of rules under the CAA that establish new emission control requirements for emissions of volatile organic compounds and methane from certain oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations and equipment, and EPA has proposed revisions to some of these regulations as recently as October 2018. In March 2015 and November 2016, the BLM finalized rules governing hydraulic fracturing and venting and flaring on federal lands. Several of the EPA\u2019s and the BLM\u2019s recently promulgated rules concerning regulation of hydraulic fracturing, including BLM\u2019s hydraulic fracturing and venting and flaring rules, are in various stages of suspension, repeal, implementation delay, and court challenges and, thus, the future of these rules is uncertain. Further, legislation to amend the SDWA to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing (except when diesel fuels are used) from the definition of \u201cunderground injection\u201d and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, have been proposed in recent sessions of Congress. Several states and local jurisdictions in which we operate also have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, such as requiring certain setback\ndistances from residences or other sensitive areas, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids.\nMore recently, federal and state governments have begun investigating whether the disposal of produced water into underground injection wells (and to a lesser extent, hydraulic fracturing) has caused increased seismic activity in certain areas. In response, some states, including states in which we operate, have imposed additional requirements on the construction and operation of underground disposal wells. For example, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission\u2019s Oil and Gas Conservation Division and the Oklahoma Geologic Survey continue to release well completion seismicity guidance, discussed in more detail below, which most recently directs operators to adopt seismicity response plans and take certain prescriptive actions, including mitigation, following anomalous seismic activity within 3.1 miles of hydraulic fracturing operations.\nThese developments, as well as increased scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing and underground injection activities by state and municipal authorities may result in additional levels of regulation or complexity with respect to existing regulations that could lead to operational delays or cessations or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our cost of compliance and doing business.\nStudies by both state and federal agencies demonstrating a correlation between earthquakes and oil and natural gas activities could result in increased regulatory and operational burdens.\nIn recent years, Oklahoma has experienced a significant increase in earthquakes and other seismic activity. On April 21, 2015, the Oklahoma Geologic Survey (\u201cOGS\u201d) issued a document entitled \u201cStatement of Oklahoma Seismicity,\u201d in which the agency states \u201cthe OGS considers it very likely that the majority of recent earthquakes, particularly those in central and north-central Oklahoma, are triggered by the injection of produced water in disposal wells.\u201d The Oklahoma Corporation Commission (\u201cOCC\u201d) has issued directives restricting injection of high volumes of water into the Arbuckle formation and into the crystalline basement below within a specified area of interest (\u201cAOI\u201d) in Central and Western Oklahoma. The AOI now includes more than 10,000 square miles and more than 600 Arbuckle disposal wells, resulting in a reduction of more than 800,000 barrels per day from the 2015 average injection volumes. The OCC has adopted a \u201ctraffic light\u201d system for disposal operators to review disposal well permits for proximity to faults seismicity in the area and other factors, and adopted rules requiring well pressure recording and reporting, and mechanical integrity tests on certain wells. In addition, the OCC has issued directives aimed at limiting the future growth of disposal rates into the Arbuckle by capping disposal volumes in the AOI, even those not operating under currently permitted volumes, to the thirty day disposal average. We operate 10 wells in the AOI and are fully compliant with all regulations relating to the disposal of produced water, and at this time our operations have not been affected.\nIn February 2018, the Commission introduced new guidelines related to seismicity, requiring operators in the defined area to have access to a seismic array which will provide real-time seismicity readings, and to develop plans to address seismic activity. The guidelines reduce the earthquake magnitude at which action is required from 2.5 to 2.0 within a 3.1 mile radius of hydraulic fracturing operations, and changes the level at which operators are required to pause hydraulic fracturing operations from 3.0 to 2.5.\nWe cannot predict whether future regulatory actions will result in further expansion of AOI or new or additional regulations by the OCC or other agencies with jurisdiction over our operations. Any such new or expanded regulation could result in increased operating costs, cause operational delays, and result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to inject produced water into disposal wells. Increased complexity and reporting requirements arising from expanded regulations may increase our costs of compliance and doing business. In addition, even though we have conducted our operations in compliance with applicable laws, the increase in media and regulatory attention to the possible connection between seismic activity and produced water injection has led to litigation filed against us and other oil and gas producers requesting compensation for damages, including demands for damages caused by earthquakes and earthquake insurance premiums on a going forward basis. We cannot predict the outcome of this litigation or provide assurances that other similar claims will not be filed against us in the future.\nWe are responsible for the decommissioning, abandonment, and reclamation costs for our facilities.\nWe are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the decommissioning, abandonment and reclamation of our facilities at the end of their economic life, the costs of which may be substantial. Although we make estimates of such costs and record the associated liability on our balance sheet, there is no assurance that our cost estimates will coincide with actual costs when the remediation work takes place. The timing and amount of costs is difficult to predict with certainty since they will be a function of regulatory requirements at the time of decommissioning, abandonment and reclamation. We may, in the future, determine it prudent or be required by applicable laws or regulations to establish and fund one or more decommissioning, abandonment and reclamation reserve funds to provide for payment of future decommissioning, abandonment and reclamation costs, which could decrease funds available to service debt obligations. In addition, such reserves, if established, may not be sufficient to satisfy such future decommissioning, abandonment and reclamation costs and we will be responsible for the payment of the balance of such costs.\nCosts of environmental liabilities could exceed our estimates and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur operations are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, which obligate us to install and maintain pollution controls and to clean up various sites at which regulated materials may have been disposed of or released. It is not possible for us to estimate reliably the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters because of:\n\u2022\nthe uncertainties in estimating cleanup costs;\n\u2022\nthe discovery of additional contamination or contamination more widespread than previously thought;\n\u2022\nthe uncertainty in quantifying liability under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties;\n\u2022\nnew listing of species as \"threatened\" or \"endangered\";\n\u2022\nchanges in interpretation and enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nfuture changes to environmental laws and regulations and their enforcement.\nAlthough we believe we have established appropriate reserves for known liabilities, including cleanup costs, we could be required to set aside additional reserves in the future due to these uncertainties, incur material cleanup costs, other liabilities, and/or expend significant sums to defend ourselves against litigation related to legacy environmental issues, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nOur use of derivative instruments could result in financial losses or reduce our income.\nTo reduce our exposure to the volatility in the price of oil and gas and provide stability to cash flows, we enter into derivative positions. Our commodity hedges are currently comprised of fixed price swaps, basis swaps and collars with financial institutions. The volumes and average notional prices of these hedges are disclosed in in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this report.\nDerivative instruments expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u2022\nour production is less than expected;\n\u2022\nthe counterparty to the derivative instruments defaults on its contractual obligations; or\n\u2022\nthere is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the derivative instruments.\nDerivatives also expose us to risk of income reduction as derivative instruments may limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas. Additionally, none of our derivatives are classified as hedges for accounting purposes and therefore must be adjusted to fair value through income each reporting period.\nWhile the primary purpose of our derivative transactions is to protect ourselves against the volatility in oil and natural gas prices, under certain circumstances, or if hedges are discontinued, or terminated for any reason, we may incur substantial losses in closing out our positions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe implementation of derivatives legislation adopted by the U.S. Congress could have an adverse effect on us and our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d) and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market including swap clearing and trade execution requirements. New or modified rules, regulations or requirements may increase the cost and availability to the counterparties of our hedging and swap positions which they can make available to us, as applicable, and may further require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivative activities to separate entities which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties. Any changes in the regulations of swaps may result in certain market participants deciding to curtail or cease their derivative activities.\nWhile many rules and regulations have been promulgated and are already in effect, other rules and regulations remain to be finalized or effectuated, and therefore, the impact of those rules and regulations on us is uncertain at this time. The Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder, could (i) significantly increase the cost, or decrease the liquidity, of energy-related derivatives that we use to hedge against commodity price fluctuations (including through requirements to post collateral), (ii) materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, (iii) reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, and (iv) increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties.\nWe are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks.\nOur future success depends on our ability to access capital markets and obtain financing on reasonable terms. Our ability to access financial markets and obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms in the future is dependent on a number of factors, many of which we cannot control, including changes in:\n\u2022\nour credit ratings;\n\u2022\ninterest rates;\n\u2022\nthe structured and commercial financial markets;\n\u2022\nmarket perceptions of us or the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry; and\n\u2022\ntax burden due to new tax laws.\nAssuming a constant debt level of $325.0 million, equal to our borrowing base as of December 7, 2018 under our New Credit Facility, the cash flow impact for a 12-month period resulting from a 100 basis point movement in interest rates, regardless of whether the spread widens or tightens, would be $3.3 million. As a result, any increases in our interest rates, or our inability to access the equity markets on reasonable terms, could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. The interest rate on our Senior Notes is fixed.\nWe are exposed to counterparty credit risk as a result of our receivables.\nWe are exposed to risk of financial loss in connection with our receivables from joint interest owners and oil and natural gas purchasers which are generally uncollateralized. We generally review our oil and natural gas purchasers for credit worthiness and general financial condition. However, there is a possibility that some of our purchasers may experience credit downgrades or liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us. Nonperformance by an oil or natural gas purchaser could result in financial losses.\nUnusual weather patterns or natural disasters, whether due to climate change or otherwise, could negatively impact our financial condition.\nOur business depends, in part, on normal weather patterns across the United States. Natural gas demand and prices are particularly susceptible to seasonal weather trends. Warmer than usual winters can result in reduced demand and high season-end storage volumes, which can depress prices to unacceptably low levels. In addition, because a majority of our properties are located in Oklahoma, our operations are constantly at risk of extreme adverse weather conditions such as freezing rain, tornadoes, drought, and hurricanes. Any unusual or prolonged adverse weather patterns in our areas of operations or markets, whether due to climate change or otherwise, could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and cash flow. In addition, our business, financial condition and cash flow could be adversely affected if the businesses of our key vendors, purchasers, contractors, suppliers or transportation service providers were disrupted due to severe weather, such as freezing rain, hurricanes or floods, whether due to climate change or otherwise.\nA change in the jurisdictional characterization of our assets, or a change in policy, could result in increased regulation of our assets which could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain of our pipeline assets are natural gas gathering facilities. Unlike interstate natural gas transportation facilities, natural gas gathering facilities are exempt from the jurisdiction of FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (\u201cNGA\u201d). Although FERC has not made a formal determination with respect to all of our facilities we believe to be gathering facilities, we believe that these pipelines meet the traditional tests that FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and is therefore not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, and FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts or Congress. If FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility and/or services provided by it are not exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA and that the facility provides interstate service, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by FERC under the NGA or the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (\u201cNGPA\u201d). Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the NGA or NGPA, this could result in the imposition of civil penalties, as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such services in excess of the rate established by FERC.\nIncreased regulatory requirements regarding pipeline safety and integrity management may require us to incur significant capital and operating expenses to comply.\nThe ultimate costs of compliance with pipeline safety and integrity management regulations are difficult to predict. The majority of the compliance costs are for pipeline safety and integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary. We plan to continue our efforts to assess and maintain the safety and integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by the DOT and PHMSA rules. The results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines. In addition, new laws and regulations that may be enacted in the future, or a revised interpretation of existing laws and regulations, could significantly increase the amount of these costs. We cannot be assured about the amount or timing of future expenditures for pipeline integrity regulation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs, or additional operating restrictions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.\nShortages of oil field equipment, services and qualified personnel could reduce our cash flow and adversely affect results of operations.\nThe demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices, causing periodic shortages in such personnel. The severe industry decline that began in mid-2014 resulted in a large displacement of experienced personnel through layoffs and many of the affected personnel moved on to careers in other industries. This structural shift in available workforce may be impactful in future periods. During future periods where there may be increased demand for drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, oilfield equipment and services, and personnel, we may encounter shortages of these resources as well as increased prices. These types of shortages or price increases could significantly decrease our profit margin, cash flow and operating results and/or restrict or delay our ability to drill those wells and conduct those operations that we currently have planned and budgeted, causing us to miss our forecasts and projections.\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations, including certain of our exploration, development and production activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information and in many other activities related to our business. Our business partners, including vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production, and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology.\nOur technologies, systems networks, and those of our business partners, may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the disruption of our business operations. For example, unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruptions in our drilling or production operations. To date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks, however there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance their protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cyber vulnerabilities. A cyber incident could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for natural gas.\nThe EPA has determined that GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because such gases contribute to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has adopted and implemented, and continues to adopt and implement, regulations that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d) under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d). The EPA also requires the annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain large sources of GHG emissions in the United States, including certain oil and gas production facilities and oil and natural gas gathering and boosting operations. The EPA has also taken steps to limit methane emissions from oil and gas production facilities. In addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. And in December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake \u201cambitious efforts\u201d to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance\nsinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases. The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016. However, President Trump has since announced that the United States will withdraw from the Agreement; notably, the earliest date of withdrawal under the terms of the Agreement is November 4, 2020. Restrictions on emissions of GHGs that may be imposed could adversely affect the natural gas industry by reducing demand for hydrocarbons and by making it more expensive to develop and produce hydrocarbons, either of which could have a material adverse effect on future demand for our services. Moreover, climate change may cause more extreme weather conditions and increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our operations and increase our costs, and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured.

Companies in the oil and gas industry are often the target of activist efforts regarding safety, environmental compliance and business practices. Anti-development activists are working to, among other things, reduce access to federal and state government lands and delay or cancel certain projects such as the development of oil or gas shale plays. Future activist efforts could result in the following:\n\u2022\ndelay or denial of drilling permits;\n\u2022\nshortening of lease terms or reduction in lease size;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on installation or operation of production, gathering or processing facilities;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the use of certain operating practices, such as hydraulic fracturing, or the disposal of related waste materials, such as hydraulic fracturing fluids and produced water;\n\u2022\nincreased severance and/or other taxes;\n\u2022\ncyber-attacks;\n\u2022\nlegal challenges or lawsuits;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity about our business or the industry in general;\n\u2022\nincreased costs of doing business; and\n\u2022\nreduction in demand for our products.\nWe may need to incur significant costs associated with responding to these initiatives. Complying with any resulting additional legal or regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest.\nAlthough we take the steps customary in the oil and natural gas industry to review title and perform any curative work with respect to any title defects, our failure to completely cure any title defects may invalidate our title to the subject property and adversely impact our ability in the future to increase production and reserves. Any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest may have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As others use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial costs. In addition, other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and that may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete, or if we are unable to use the most advanced commercially available technology, it could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.", "PERMNO": 17981, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CHAPQ"}
