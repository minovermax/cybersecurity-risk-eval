{"cik": "924515", "company": "GUIDED THERAPEUTICS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nA purchase of our securities involves a high degree of risk. Our business or operating or financial condition could be harmed due to any of the following risks. Accordingly, investors should carefully consider these risks in making a decision as to whether to purchase, sell or hold our securities. In addition, investors should note that the risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us, or risks that do not seem significant today, may impair our business operations in the future. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference herein, before making a decision to invest in our securities.\nWe will be required to raise additional funds in 2022. There is no assurance that such funds can be raised on terms that we would find acceptable, on a timely basis, or at all.\nAdditional debt or equity financing will be required for us to continue as a going concern. We may seek to obtain additional funds for the financing of our cervical cancer detection business through additional debt or equity financings and/or new collaborative arrangements. Management believes that additional financing, if obtainable, will be sufficient to support planned operations only for a limited period. Management has implemented operating actions to reduce cash requirements. Any required additional funding may not be available on terms attractive to us, on a timely basis, or at all. If we cannot obtain additional funds or achieve profitability, we may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nBecause we must obtain additional funds through financing transactions or through new collaborative arrangements in order to grow the revenues of our cervical cancer detection product line, there exists substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, it will be necessary to raise additional funds. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise these additional funds. If we do not secure additional funding when needed, we will be unable to conduct all of our product development efforts as planned, which may cause us to alter our business plan in relation to the development of our products. Even if we obtain additional funding, we will need to achieve profitability thereafter.\nOur independent registered public accountants\u2019 report on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, indicated that there was substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern because we had suffered recurring losses from operations and had an accumulated deficit of $142.4 million at December 31, 2021 summarized as follows:\nOur management has implemented reductions in operating expenditures and reductions in some development activities. We have determined to make cervical cancer detection the focus of our business. We are managing the development of our other programs only when funds are made available to us via grants or contracts with government entities or strategic partners. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement or continue these plans.\nIf we cannot obtain additional funds when needed, we will not be able to implement our business plan.\nWe require substantial additional capital to develop our products, including completing product testing and clinical trials, obtaining all required regulatory approvals and clearances, beginning and scaling up manufacturing, and marketing our products. We have historically financed our operations though the public and private sale of debt and equity, funding from collaborative arrangements, and grants. Any failure to achieve adequate funding in a timely fashion would delay our development programs and could lead to abandonment of our business plan. To the extent we cannot obtain additional funding, our ability to continue to manufacture and sell our current products, or develop and introduce new products to market, will be limited. Further, financing our operations through the public or private sale of debt or equity may involve restrictive covenants or other provisions that could limit how we conduct our business or finance our operations. Financing our operations through collaborative arrangements generally means that the obligations of the collaborative partner to fund our expenditures are largely discretionary and depend on a number of factors, including our ability to meet specified milestones in the development and testing of the relevant product. We may not be able to obtain an acceptable collaboration partner, and even if we do, we may not be able to meet these milestones, or the collaborative partner may not continue to fund our expenditures.\nWe have a history of losses, and we expect losses to continue.\nWe have never been profitable and we have had operating losses since our inception. We expect our operating losses to continue as we continue to expend substantial resources to complete commercialization of our products, obtain regulatory clearances or approvals; build our marketing, sales, manufacturing and finance capabilities, and conduct further research and development. The further development and commercialization of our products will require substantial development, regulatory, sales and marketing, manufacturing and other expenditures. We have only generated limited revenues from product sales. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our accumulated deficit was approximately $142.4 million and $140.0 million, respectively.\nWe are currently delinquent with our federal and state payroll and unemployment taxes.\nAlthough we have been experiencing recurring losses, we are obligated to file tax returns for compliance with IRS regulations and that of applicable state jurisdictions. We have established payment plans for the outstanding federal and state payroll and unemployment taxes with IRS, the Department of Revenue for the State of Georgia and Department of Labor for the State of Georgia. We are delinquent on federal payroll taxes for first quarter of 2017 and federal unemployment taxes for the year 2016. Per the terms of our payment plan we are required to make monthly payments in the amount of $1,009 until the balances are paid in full. We are delinquent on state payroll taxes for first quarter of 2017 and fourth quarter of 2016. Per the terms of our payment plan we are required to make monthly payments in the amount of $210 until the balances are paid in full. We are delinquent on our state unemployment taxes and per the terms of our payment plan we are required to make a minimum monthly payment in the amount of $2,629 until the balance is paid in full.\nOur ability to sell our products is controlled by government regulations, and we may not be able to obtain any necessary clearances or approvals.\nThe design, manufacturing, labeling, distribution and marketing of medical device products are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation in most of the markets in which we sell, or plan to sell, our products, which can be expensive and uncertain and can cause lengthy delays before we can begin selling our products in those markets.\nIn foreign countries, including European countries, we are subject to government regulation, which could delay or prevent our ability to sell our products in those jurisdictions.\nIn order for us to market our products in Europe and some other international jurisdictions, we and our distributors and agents must obtain required regulatory registrations or approvals. We must also comply with extensive regulations regarding safety, efficacy and quality in those jurisdictions. We may not be able to obtain the required regulatory registrations or approvals, or we may be required to incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining any regulatory registrations or approvals we receive. Delays in obtaining any registrations or approvals required for marketing our products, failure to receive these registrations or approvals, or future loss of previously obtained registrations or approvals would limit our ability to sell our products internationally. For example, international regulatory bodies have adopted various regulations governing product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import restrictions, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. These regulations vary from country to country. In order to sell our products in Europe, in 2018 we had to undergo an inspection and re-file for ISO 13485:2016 and the CE Mark, which is an international symbol of quality and compliance with applicable European medical device directives. Failure to maintain ISO 13485:2016 certification or CE mark certification or other international regulatory approvals would prevent us from selling in some countries in the European Union.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our products have achieved and maintain both ISO 13485:2016 certification and the CE Mark through our contract manufacturer, Newmars Technologies.\nFor our products to be marketed and sold in the People\u2019s Republic of China, they must gain approval from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), formerly known as the Chinese Food and Drug Administration (Chinese FDA). We are working with our Chinese partner, Shandong Yaohua Medical Instrument Corporation, to achieve NMPA approval and as of December 31, 2021 had passed compliance testing for device safety and preparing for the clinical trial necessary for NMPA approval.\nOur business is subject to the risks of international operations.\nOur business and financial results could be adversely affected due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nchanges in a specific country or region\u2019s political and cultural climate or economic condition, including change in governmental regime;\n\u00b7\nunexpected or unfavorable changes in foreign laws, regulatory requirements and related interpretations;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\ninadequate intellectual property protection in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\ntrade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements such as Export Administration Regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Commerce and fines, penalties or suspension or revocation of export privileges;\n\u00b7\ntrade sanctions imposed by the United States or other governments with jurisdictional authority over our business operations;\n\u00b7\nthe effects of applicable and potentially adverse foreign tax law changes;\n\u00b7\nsignificant adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\nlonger accounts receivable cycles;\n\u00b7\nmanaging a geographically dispersed workforce; and\n\u00b7\ncompliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations, particularly in emerging markets.\nIn foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, certain business practices may exist that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws. Although our policies and procedures require compliance with these laws and are designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors and agents may take actions in violation of applicable laws or our policies. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nOur international businesses must comply with applicable laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Failure to maintain compliance with or adapt to changes in any of the aforementioned requirements could result in fines, penalties or regulatory actions that could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn the United States, our products would be subject to regulation by the U.S. FDA, which could prevent us from selling our products domestically.\nIn order for us to market our products in the United States, we must obtain clearance or approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or U.S. FDA. We cannot be sure that:\n\u00b7\nwe, or any collaborative partner, will make timely filings with the U.S. FDA;\n\u00b7\nthe U.S. FDA will act favorably or quickly on these submissions;\n\u00b7\nwe will not be required to submit additional information or perform additional clinical studies; or\n\u00b7\nwe will not face other significant difficulties and costs necessary to obtain U.S. FDA clearance or approval.\nIt can take several years from initial filing of a PMA application and require the submission of extensive supporting data and clinical information. The U.S. FDA may impose strict labeling or other requirements as a condition of its clearance or approval, any of which could limit our ability to market our products domestically. Further, if we wish to modify a product after U.S. FDA approval of a PMA application, including changes in indications or other modifications that could affect safety and efficacy, additional clearances or approvals will be required from the U.S. FDA. Any request by the U.S. FDA for additional data, or any requirement by the U.S. FDA that we conduct additional clinical studies, could result in a significant delay in bringing our products to market domestically and require substantial additional research and other expenditures. Similarly, any labeling or other conditions or restrictions imposed by the U.S. FDA could hinder our ability to effectively market our products domestically. Further, there may be new U.S. FDA policies or changes in U.S. FDA policies that could be adverse to us.\nCurrently, we have agreed with the U.S. FDA on the clinical trial protocol and are preparing to start the study of approximately 400 women in the first or second quarter of 2022 at up to three clinical sites where the protocol is now under review for approval to allow start of study.\nEven if we obtain clearance or approval to sell our products, we are subject to ongoing requirements and inspections that could lead to the restriction, suspension or revocation of our clearance.\nWe, as well as any potential collaborative partners, will be required to adhere to applicable regulations in the markets in which we operate and sell our products, regarding good manufacturing practice, which include testing, control, and documentation requirements. Ongoing compliance with good manufacturing practice and other applicable regulatory requirements will be strictly enforced applicable regulatory agencies. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, failure to obtain premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices, withdrawal of approvals previously obtained, and criminal prosecution. The restriction, suspension or revocation of regulatory approvals or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements would limit our ability to operate and could increase our costs.\nWe depend on a limited number of distributors and any reduction, delay or cancellation of an order from these distributors or the loss of any of these distributors could cause our revenue to decline.\nEach year we have had one or a few distributors that have accounted for substantially all of our limited revenues. As a result, the termination of a purchase order with any one of these distributors may result in the loss of substantially all of our revenues. We are constantly working to develop new relationships with existing or new distributors, but despite these efforts we may not be successful at generating new orders to maintain similar revenues as current purchase orders are filled. In addition, since a significant portion of our revenues is derived from a relatively few distributors, any financial difficulties experienced by any one of these distributors, or any delay in receiving payments from any one of these distributors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nTo successfully market and sell our products internationally, we must address many issues with which we have limited experience.\nAll of our sales of LuViva to date have been to distributors outside of the United States. We expect that substantially all of our business will continue to come from sales in foreign markets, through increased penetration in countries where we currently sell LuViva, combined with expansion into new international markets. However, international sales are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in penetrating markets in which our competitors\u2019 products may be more established;\n\u00b7\nreduced or no protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u00b7\nexport restrictions, trade regulations and foreign tax laws;\n\u00b7\nfluctuating foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\nforeign certification and regulatory clearance or approval requirements;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in developing effective marketing campaigns for unfamiliar, foreign countries;\n\u00b7\ncustoms clearance and shipping delays;\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic instability; and\n\u00b7\npreference for locally produced products.\nIf one or more of these risks were realized, it could require us to dedicate significant resources to remedy the situation, and even if we are able to find a solution, our revenues may still decline.\nTo market and sell LuViva internationally, we depend on distributors and they may not be successful.\nWe currently depend almost exclusively on third-party distributors to sell and service LuViva internationally and to train our international distributors, and if these distributors terminate their relationships with us or under-perform, we may be unable to maintain or increase our level of international revenue. We will also need to engage additional international distributors to grow our business and expand the territories in which we sell LuViva. Distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market, sell and service LuViva to the level of our expectations. If current or future distributors do not perform adequately, or if we are unable to engage distributors in particular geographic areas, our revenue from international operations will be adversely affected.\nOur success largely depends on our ability to maintain and protect the proprietary information on which we base our products.\nOur success depends in large part upon our ability to maintain and protect the proprietary nature of our technology through the patent process, as well as our ability to license from others patents and patent applications necessary to develop our products. If any of our patents are successfully challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or our right or ability to manufacture our products was to be limited, our ability to continue to manufacture and market our products could be adversely affected. In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how, which we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. The other parties to these agreements may breach these provisions, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Additionally, our trade secrets could otherwise become known to or be independently developed by competitors.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have been issued, or have rights to, 27 U.S. patents (including those under license). In addition, we have filed for, or have rights to, one U.S. patents (including those under license) that is still pending. There are additional international patents and pending applications. One or more of the patents we hold directly or license from third parties, including those for our cervical cancer detection products, may be successfully challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may otherwise be unable to rely on these patents. These risks are also present for the process we use or will use for manufacturing our products. In addition, our competitors, many of whom have substantial resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies, may apply for and obtain patents that prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use and sell our products, either in the United States or in international markets.\nThe medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. In addition, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, may institute interference proceedings. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, USPTO proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings are both costly and time consuming. Moreover, we may need to litigate to enforce our patents, to protect our trade secrets or know-how, or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Any litigation or interference proceedings involving us may require us to incur substantial legal and other fees and expenses and may require some of our employees to devote all or a substantial portion of their time to the proceedings. An adverse determination in the proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from selling our products in some or all markets. We may not be able to reach a satisfactory settlement of any dispute by licensing necessary patents or other intellectual property. Even if we reached a settlement, the settlement process may be expensive and time consuming, and the terms of the settlement may require us to pay substantial royalties. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or the failure to obtain a necessary license could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient sales revenues to sustain our growth and strategy plans.\nOur cervical cancer diagnostic activities have been financed to date through a combination of government grants, strategic partners and direct investment. Growing revenues for this product is the main focus of our business. In order to effectively market the cervical cancer detection product, additional capital will be needed.\nAdditional product lines involve the modification of the cervical cancer detection technology for use in other cancers. These product lines are only in the earliest stages of research and development and are currently not projected to reach market for several years. Our goal is to receive enough funding from government grants and contracts, as well as payments from strategic partners, to fund development of these product lines without diverting funds or other necessary resources from the cervical cancer program.\nBecause our products, which use different technology or apply technology in different ways than other medical devices, are or will be new to the market, we may not be successful in launching our products and our operations and growth would be adversely affected.\nOur products are based on new methods of cancer detection. If our products do not achieve significant market acceptance, our sales will be limited and our financial condition may suffer. Physicians and individuals may not recommend or use our products unless they determine that these products are an attractive alternative to current tests that have a long history of safe and effective use. To date, our products have been used by only a limited number of people, and few independent studies regarding our products have been published. The lack of independent studies limits the ability of doctors or consumers to compare our products to conventional products.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively in the highly competitive medical device industry, our future growth and operating results will suffer.\nThe medical device industry in general and the markets in which we expect to offer products in particular, are intensely competitive. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, research, technical, manufacturing, marketing and distribution resources than we do and have greater name recognition and lengthier operating histories in the health care industry. We may not be able to effectively compete against these and other competitors. A number of competitors are currently marketing traditional laboratory-based tests for cervical cancer screening and diagnosis. These tests are widely accepted in the health care industry and have a long history of accurate and effective use. Further, if our products are not available at competitive prices, health care administrators who are subject to increasing pressures to reduce costs may not elect to purchase them. Also, a number of companies have announced that they are developing, or have introduced, products that permit non-invasive and less invasive cancer detection. Accordingly, competition in this area is expected to increase.\nFurthermore, our competitors may succeed in developing, either before or after the development and commercialization of our products, devices and technologies that permit more efficient, less expensive non-invasive and less invasive cancer detection. It is also possible that one or more pharmaceutical or other health care companies will develop therapeutic drugs, treatments or other products that will substantially reduce the prevalence of cancers or otherwise render our products obsolete.\nWe have limited manufacturing experience, which could limit our growth.\nWe do not have manufacturing experience that would enable us to make products in the volumes that would be necessary for us to achieve significant commercial sales, and we rely upon our suppliers. In addition, we may not be able to establish and maintain reliable, efficient, full scale manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs in a timely fashion. Difficulties we encounter in manufacturing scale-up, or our failure to implement and maintain our manufacturing facilities in accordance with good manufacturing practice regulations, international quality standards or other regulatory requirements, could result in a delay or termination of production. In the past, we have had substantial difficulties in establishing and maintaining manufacturing for our products and those difficulties impacted our ability to increase sales. Companies often encounter difficulties in scaling up production, including problems involving production yield, quality control and assurance, and shortages of qualified personnel.\nSince we rely on sole source suppliers for several of the components used in our products, any failure of those suppliers to perform would hurt our operations.\nSeveral of the components used in our products or planned products, are available from only one supplier, and substitutes for these components could not be obtained easily or would require substantial modifications to our products. Any significant problem experienced by one of our sole source suppliers may result in a delay or interruption in the supply of components to us until that supplier cures the problem or an alternative source of the component is located and qualified. Any delay or interruption would likely lead to a delay or interruption in our manufacturing operations. For our products that require premarket approval, the inclusion of substitute components could require us to qualify the new supplier with the appropriate government regulatory authorities. Alternatively, for our products that qualify for premarket notification, the substitute components must meet our product specifications.\nBecause we operate in an industry with significant product liability risk, and we have not specifically insured against this risk, we may be subject to substantial claims against our products.\nThe development, manufacture and sale of medical products entail significant risks of product liability claims. We currently have no product liability insurance coverage beyond that provided by our general liability insurance. Accordingly, we may not be adequately protected from any liabilities, including any adverse judgments or settlements, we might incur in connection with the development, clinical testing, manufacture and sale of our products. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us that result in an adverse judgment against or settlement by us in excess of any insurance coverage could seriously harm our financial condition or reputation. In addition, product liability insurance is expensive and may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nThe availability of third party reimbursement for our products is uncertain, which may limit consumer use and the market for our products.\nIn the United States and elsewhere, sales of medical products are dependent, in part, on the ability of consumers of these products to obtain reimbursement for all or a portion of their cost from third-party payors, such as government and private insurance plans. Any inability of patients, hospitals, physicians and other users of our products to obtain sufficient reimbursement from third-party payors for our products, or adverse changes in relevant governmental policies or the policies of private third-party payors regarding reimbursement for these products, could limit our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis. We are unable to predict what changes will be made in the reimbursement methods used by third-party health care payors. Moreover, third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and some health care providers are gradually adopting a managed care system in which the providers contract to provide comprehensive health care services for a fixed cost per person. Patients, hospitals and physicians may not be able to justify the use of our products by the attendant cost savings and clinical benefits that we believe will be derived from the use of our products, and therefore may not be able to obtain third-party reimbursement.\nReimbursement and health care payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country and include both government-sponsored health care and private insurance. We may not be able to obtain approvals for reimbursement from these international third-party payors in a timely manner, if at all. Any failure to receive international reimbursement approvals could have an adverse effect on market acceptance of our products in the international markets in which approvals are sought.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business.\nOur outstanding indebtedness, which includes all of our liabilities, was $7.5 million at December 31, 2021. The terms of our indebtedness could have negative consequences to us, such as:\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to obtain additional financing to fund working capital, operating losses, capital expenditures or acquisitions on terms acceptable to us, or at all;\n\u00b7\nthe amount of our interest expense may increase if we are unable to make payments when due;\n\u00b7\nour assets might be subject to foreclosure if we default on our secured debt\n\u00b7\nour vendors or employees may, and some have, instituted proceedings to collect on amounts owed them;\n\u00b7\nwe have to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to repay our indebtedness, including ordinary course accounts payable and accrued payroll liabilities, which reduces the amount of money we have for future operations, working capital, inventory, expansion, or general corporate or other business activities; and\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nOur ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will be unable to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions. We cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet any other obligations. If we do not have enough money to service our debt, we may be required, but unable, to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain scientific, technical, managerial and finance personnel.\nOur ability to operate successfully and manage our future growth depends in significant part upon the continued service of key scientific, technical, managerial and finance personnel, as well as our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel in these fields. We may not be able to attract and retain key employees when necessary, which would limit our operations and growth. In addition, if we are able to successfully develop and commercialize our products, we will need to hire additional scientific, technical, marketing, managerial and finance personnel. We face intense competition for qualified personnel in these areas, many of whom are often subject to competing employment offers.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation that authorize the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a third party to effect a change in control.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 5.0 million shares of preferred stock of which 11,759 were outstanding as of December 31, 2021. Our undesignated shares of preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined by the board without further stockholder action. These terms may include, among other terms, voting rights, including the right to vote as a series on particular matters, preferences as to liquidation and dividends, repurchase rights, conversion rights, redemption rights and sinking fund provisions. The issuance of any preferred stock could diminish the rights of holders of our common stock, and therefore could reduce the value of our common stock. In addition, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with or sell assets to a third party. The ability of our board to issue preferred stock could make it more difficult, delay, discourage, prevent or make it more costly to acquire or effect a change in control, which in turn could prevent our stockholders from recognizing a gain in the event that a favorable offer is extended and could materially and negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market prices for our common stock are volatile and will fluctuate.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following: (i) actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial results; (ii) recommendations by securities research analysts; (iii) changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other issuers that investors deem comparable to ours; (iv) addition or departure of our executive officers or members of our Board and other key personnel; (v) release or expiration of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on outstanding common stock; (vi) sales or perceived sales of additional common stock; (vii) liquidity of the common stock; (viii) significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors; and (ix) news reports relating to trends, concerns, technological or competitive developments, regulatory changes and other related issues in our industry or target markets. Financial markets often experience significant price and volume fluctuations that affect the market prices of equity securities of public entities and that are, in many cases, unrelated to the operating performance, underlying asset values or prospects of such entities. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock may decline even if our operating results, underlying asset values or prospects have not changed. Additionally, these factors, as well as other related factors, may cause decreases in asset values that are deemed to be other than temporary, which may result in impairment losses. As well, certain institutional investors may base their investment decisions on consideration of our environmental, governance and social practices and performance against such institutions\u2019 respective investment guidelines and criteria, and failure to meet such criteria may result in limited or no investment in our common stock by those institutions, which could materially adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that continuing fluctuations in price and volume will not occur. If such increased levels of volatility and market turmoil continue for a protracted period of time, our operations could be materially adversely impacted and the trading price of our common stock may be materially adversely affected.\nThere is a limited market for our securities.\nOur common stock is listed on the OTC Markets. We have applied to list our common stock on Nasdaq. However, there can be no assurance that Nasdaq will approve our listing application, or that an active and liquid market for the common stock will develop or be maintained on the applicable stock exchanges, and an investor may find it difficult to resell any of our securities.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies.\nWe may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, existing ownership interests will be diluted and the terms of such financings may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of existing stockholders. Debt financings may be coupled with an equity component, such as warrants to purchase shares, which could also result in dilution of our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business and may result in liens being placed on our assets and intellectual property. If we were to default on such indebtedness, we could lose such assets and intellectual property. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nFuture offerings of debt or equity securities may rank senior to common stock.\nIf we decide to issue debt or equity securities in the future ranking senior to our common stock or otherwise incur additional indebtedness, it is possible that these securities or indebtedness will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility and limiting our ability to pay dividends to stockholders. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges, including with respect to dividends, more favorable than those of common stock and may result in dilution to stockholders. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering or otherwise incur indebtedness will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings or financings, any of which could reduce the market price of our common stock and dilute their value.\nCommon stockholders are subordinated to our lenders.\nIn the event of bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, any holders of our debt and our trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from our assets before any assets are made available for distribution to us or our stockholders. The common stock is effectively subordinated to our debt and other obligations.\nFuture sales of common stock by officers and directors may negatively impact the market price for our common stock.\nSubject to compliance with applicable securities laws, our directors and officers and their affiliates may sell some or all of their common stock in the future. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, such future sales of common stock may have on the market price of the common stock prevailing from time to time. However, the future sale of a substantial number of common stock by our directors and officers and their affiliates, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nWe do not currently pay dividends on our common stock and have no intention to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nNo dividends on our common stock have been paid by us to date. We do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board, after taking into account a multitude of factors appropriate in the circumstances, including our operating results, financial condition and current and anticipated cash needs. In addition, the terms of any future debt or credit facility may preclude us from paying any dividends unless certain consents are obtained and certain conditions are met.\nWe may not be able to maintain the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq.\nWe must meet certain financial and liquidity criteria to maintain the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq. If we fail to meet any of Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing standards, our common stock may be delisted. These continued listing standards include specifically enumerated criteria, such as:\n\u00b7\na $1.00 minimum closing bid price;\n\u00b7\nstockholders\u2019 equity of $2.5 million;\n\u00b7\n500,000 shares of publicly-held common stock with a market value of at least $1 million;\n\u00b7\n300 round-lot stockholders; and\n\u00b7\nCompliance with Nasdaq\u2019s corporate governance requirements, as well as additional or more stringent criteria that may be applied in the exercise of Nasdaq\u2019s discretionary authority.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance and remain in compliance in the future. In particular, our share price may continue to decline for a number of reasons, including many that are beyond our control.\nIn addition, our board may determine that the cost of maintaining our listing on a national securities exchange outweighs the benefits of such listing. A delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq would materially impair our stockholders\u2019 ability to buy and sell our common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our common stock. A delisting of our common stock would also significantly impair our ability to raise capital.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of our cash and cash equivalents, and may not use them effectively.\nOur management has broad discretion to use our cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations and could spend these funds in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common stock,. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause the price of our common stock to decline. Pending their use to fund our operations, we may invest our cash and cash equivalents in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value.\nIf our shares of common stock become subject to the penny stock rules, it would become more difficult to trade our shares.\nThe SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. If we are unable to maintain the listing of our common stock on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange and if the price of our common stock is less than $5.00, our common stock will be deemed a penny stock. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information. In addition, the penny stock rules require that before effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive (i) the purchaser\u2019s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii) a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their shares.\nIn connection with the audits of our financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting were identified and we may identify additional material weaknesses in the future.\nIn connection with the preparation and audits of our financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, material weaknesses (as defined under the Exchange Act and by the auditing standards of the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or \u201cPCAOB\u201d), were identified in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses identified arose from a lack of resources to properly research and account for complex transactions and lack of oversight and approval by the Board of Directors and Audit Committee, including formally documented approval of significant transactions, including related party transactions.\nThere were no changes to the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting occurred during the year ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nIn light of the identified material weaknesses, it is possible that, had we performed a formal assessment of our internal control over financial reporting or had our independent registered public accounting firm performed an audit of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with PCAOB standards, additional control deficiencies may have been identified.\nWe have begun taking measures, and plan to continue to take measures, to remediate these material weaknesses. However, the implementation of these measures may not fully address these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and, if so, we would not be able to conclude that they have been fully remedied. Our failure to correct these material weaknesses or our failure to discover and address any other control deficiencies could result in inaccuracies in our financial statements and could also impair our ability to comply with applicable financial reporting requirements and make related regulatory filings on a timely basis. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, as well as the trading price of our common stock, may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management has been required, and will continue to be required, to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and are continuing to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules adopted, and to be adopted, by the SEC. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives.\nMoreover, these rules and regulations have substantially increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time-consuming and costly. The increased costs have increased our net loss. These rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to maintain sufficient director\u2019s and officer\u2019s liability insurance coverage. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may continue to incur to respond to these requirements. The ongoing impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board, our Board committees or as executive officers.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws may reduce the likelihood of a potential change of control, or make it more difficult for our stockholders to replace management.\nCertain provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws could have the effect of making it more difficult for our stockholders to replace management at a time when a substantial number of stockholders might favor a change in management. These provisions include authorizing the board of directors to fill vacant directorships or increase the size of its board of directors.\nFurthermore, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to determine the rights and preferences of the shares of any such series without stockholder approval. Any series of preferred stock is likely to be senior to the common stock with respect to dividends, liquidation rights and, possibly, voting rights. The board\u2019s ability to issue preferred stock may have the effect of discouraging unsolicited acquisition proposals, thus adversely affecting the market price of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume may decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our shares price may decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our shares may decrease, which may cause our shares price and trading volume to decline.\nThe number of shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of our outstanding convertible debt and preferred stock or exercise of outstanding warrants and options is substantial.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our outstanding convertible debt was convertible into an aggregate of 3,365,518 shares of our common stock, and the outstanding shares of our Series C, Series C1, Series C2, Series D, Series E, Series F and Series preferred stock were convertible into an aggregate of 37,078,023 shares of common stock. Also, as of that date we had warrants outstanding that were exercisable for an aggregate of 27,669,634 shares, and outstanding options to purchase 1,500,000 shares. The shares of common stock issuable upon conversion or exercise of these securities would have constituted approximately 83.6% of the total number of shares of common stock then issued and outstanding.\nFurther, under the terms of our convertible debt and preferred stock, as well as certain of our outstanding warrants, the conversion price or exercise price, as the case may be, could be adjusted downward, causing substantial dilution. See \u201c-Adjustments to the conversion price for our convertible debt and preferred stock, and the exercise price for certain of our warrants, will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders.\u201d\nAdjustments to the conversion price of some of our convertible debt and preferred stock, and the exercise price for certain of our warrants, will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders.\nUnder the terms of a portion of our convertible debt, the conversion price fluctuates with the market price of our common stock. Additionally, under the terms of our Series C preferred stock, any dividends we choose to pay in shares of our common stock will be calculated based on the then-current market price of our common stock. Accordingly, if the market price of our common stock decreases, the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible debt or upon payment of dividends on our outstanding Series C preferred stock will increase, and may result in the issuance of a significant number of additional shares of our common stock.\nUnder the terms of some of our preferred stock and certain of our convertible notes and outstanding warrants, the conversion price or exercise price will be lowered if we issue common stock at a per share price below the then-conversion price or then-exercise price for those securities. Reductions in the conversion price or exercise price would result in the issuance of a significant number of additional shares of our common stock upon conversion or exercise, which would result in dilution in the value of the shares of our outstanding common stock and the voting power represented thereby.\nOur need to raise additional capital in the near future or to use our equity securities for payments could have a dilutive effect on your investment.\nIn order to continue operations, we will need to raise additional capital. We may attempt to raise capital through the public or private sale of our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock. In addition, from time to time we have issued our common stock or warrants in lieu of cash payments. If we sell additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities, or issue such securities in respect of other claims or indebtedness, such sales or issuances will further dilute the percentage of our equity that you own. Depending upon the price per share of securities that we sell or issue in the future, if any, your interest in us could be further diluted by any adjustments to the number of shares and the applicable exercise price required pursuant to the terms of the agreements under which we previously issued convertible securities.\nThe perceived risk of dilution may cause our stockholders to sell their shares, which may cause a decline in the price of our common stock. Moreover, the perceived risk of dilution and the resulting downward pressure on our stock price could encourage investors to engage in short sales of our common stock. By increasing the number of shares offered for sale, material amounts of short selling could further contribute to progressive price declines in our common stock.", "PERMNO": 85212, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "GTHP"}
