{"cik": "1138951", "company": "LEAPFROG ENTERPRISES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-06-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A.-Risk Factors-\u201cOur reliance on a limited number of third-party manufacturers to produce the majority of our products presents risks to our business.\u201d\nWe have established subsidiaries in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, China to work closely with our contract manufacturing service providers. These subsidiaries manage product design, the supply of raw materials, labor and the assembly process.\nMost of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic and paper, and a majority of our products require electronic components. These raw materials are readily available from a variety of sources, but may be subject to significant price fluctuations. Some of the electronic components used to make our products, including our application-specific integrated circuits, currently come from single suppliers. For information as to how this concentration of suppliers could affect our business, see Part I, Item 1A.-Risk Factors-\u201c Significant increases in the cost of our components and raw materials or an inability to obtain these in sufficient quantities from our suppliers or alternative sources could negatively impact our financial results.\u201d\nResearch and Development\nWe design our multimedia learning platforms and related content, learning toys, and online services using a combination of in-house research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d) resources and outside consultants. Generally, once the design phase of the product is complete, the remaining development and manufacturing of the products are outsourced to third parties. Our total R&D expense was $36.0 million, $9.1 million, $35.9 million and $36.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, the three months ended March 31, 2014, and the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\n\u2022 Multimedia Learning Platform and Learning Toy Development: We believe that investment in R&D is a critical factor in strengthening our product portfolio. We have assembled a team of specialists with backgrounds in a wide variety of fields, including education, child development, hardware engineering, software development, content development, video games and toys. We have internally developed each of our current multimedia learning platforms using licensed technology, if warranted. For example, we use a version of Macromedia\u2019s Flash player in our LeapPad and Leapster multimedia learning platforms. We also use optical pattern recognition hardware and software from Anoto AB in our LeapReader line of products. We have internally developed the majority of our learning toys.\n\u2022 Content Development: Our content production department oversees development of our interactive books, educational games, and stand-alone products, applying a pedagogical approach, which is based on established educational standards. Much of our content uses licensed characters, such as Paw Patrol, Sofia the First, the Disney Princesses, Jake and the Neverland Pirates, Dora the Explorer, and Team UmiZoomi, as well as characters from Transformers and My Little Pony. Most of our concept designs are created by our in-house content production department, many members of which have prior experience in the education, entertainment and educational content or video game industries.\n\u2022 Development of Online Services: Our online-connected products provide accessibility to the Learning Path and the App Center, both of which are key competitive differentiators. Our online capabilities, such as our Learning Path and the App Center, are developed through a combination of in-house team members and third-party resources. Many members of our development and production team have prior experience in online engineering and design. Our online services are based on a combination of internally-developed content, in-licensed content and web applications hosted by third parties.\nAdvertising and Marketing\nOur advertising and marketing strategy is designed to position LeapFrog as a leader in providing engaging, effective, and fun educational entertainment for children and to establish us as one of the most trusted brands that parents seek out as they look for ways to help their child reach their potential.\nWe take an integrated approach to reach both parents and children using a mix of advertising vehicles, including television, paid search, rich online media, social media outlets such as Facebook and Twitter, and direct-to-consumer programs.\nWe have well-established retailer relationships and also communicate our messages and offerings through in-store advertisements and point-of-purchase displays and signage. Advertisements run by our retail partners, such as Wal-Mart, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, and Target, highlight promotional activities and the availability of particular LeapFrog products at these retailers\u2019 locations.\nWe leverage public relations globally as a strategy to gain additional recognition and momentum for our brand and products through media outreach focused on garnering both product-specific and corporate media coverage. Over the last three years we have established strong relationships with online industry experts and websites as well as the most influential bloggers in the mom, parent and toy spaces.\nDistribution\nOur customers generally fit into one of the following categories:\n\u2022 Retailers that resell our products to consumers, through their retail stores and their own online channels, in the U.S. and some international regions;\n\u2022 Distributors that purchase our products for resale to retailers, generally internationally; and\n\u2022 Direct consumers who purchase our apps via our App Center.\nRetailers and distributors purchase our products in advance, for pickup from our manufacturers in Asia, or through orders placed to our U.S. or international warehouses where we maintain inventories to meet expected short-term demand. Products are generally shipped through free-on-board terms, and their titles pass to customer when they are loaded on board at the port of shipment. Customers pay through pre-established letters of credit or upon payment terms, which are usually based on the date of shipment. Generally, we do not provide rights of return or extended payment terms to our customers, except for industry standard terms surrounding the return of defective merchandise.\nIntellectual Property and Licenses\nWe rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our brand, characters, and proprietary technology and information.\nWe maintain an active program to protect our investment in technology and brands by attempting to secure patent rights, trademark registrations and other intellectual property registrations. We have filed and obtained a number of patents in the U.S. and abroad. We believe that the duration of the applicable patents we are granted is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products. While our patents are an important element of the protection of our intellectual property, our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any one patent.\nFor a discussion of how our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to prevent other companies from using similar or identical technology, see Part I, Item 1A.-Risk Factors-\u201cIf we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to include intellectual property owned by others in our products, our operating results could suffer.\u201d For a discussion of how our intellectual property rights may not insulate us from claims of infringement by third parties, see Part I, Item 1A.-Risk Factors-\u201cWe may not succeed in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property rights and third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.\u201d\nIn addition to proprietary materials we have developed, we use various licensed technologies in some of our key products, such as LeapTV, LeapPad, Leapster and LeapReader. Our continued use of these rights is dependent on our continued compliance with applicable license terms. Any failure to do so could interrupt our supply chain and require us to modify our products or business plans. Please see Part I, Item 1A.-Risk Factors-\u201cIf we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to include intellectual property owned by others in our products, our operating results could suffer\u201d for further discussion of the risks we face in relying on third-party technology licenses for our products.\nSeasonality\nOur business is highly seasonal with a significant portion of our revenue occurring in the two quarters ending September 30 and December 31. Given relatively low sales volumes in the six months ending June 30 and the fixed nature of many of our operating expenses, which occur fairly evenly throughout the year, our results of operations have historically been stronger in our quarter ending September 30 and quarter ending December 31 relative to our quarter ending March 31 and quarter ending June 30. Conversely, our cash flow from operations tends to be highest in the March quarter when we collect a majority of our accounts receivable related to sales made in the preceding December quarter. Cash flow from operations is generally lowest in our September quarter, as accounts receivable collections taper off and we build our inventory levels in preparation for the holiday season in the succeeding December quarter. The reduction in cash flow in the September quarter generally means that our available cash is at its lowest point for the year in the first month of the December quarter.\nOur seasonal net sales patterns for the years ended March 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are shown in the table below:\nSeasonal purchasing patterns and their related production lead times create risk in our business due to possible under-production of popular items or over-production of items that do not match consumer demand. In addition, our retail customers continue to manage their inventories stringently, requiring us to ship products close to the time of expected consumer demand. For more information about the effects of seasonality on our business see Part I, Item 1A.-Risk Factors-\u201cOur business is highly seasonal, and our annual operating results depend, in large part, on sales relating to the brief holiday season.\u201d\nFinancial Information about Geographic Areas\nFinancial information regarding U.S. sales and operations versus international sales and operations is included in Note 21-\u201cSegment Reporting\u201d in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For information regarding risks associated with our foreign operations upon which our international segment depends, see Part I, Item 1A.-Risk Factors-\u201cWe face risks associated with international operations.\u201d\nEmployees\nAs of March 31, 2015, we employed 524 people on a full-time basis as compared to 587 as of March 31, 2014. The decrease is primarily due to the restructuring plan we implemented in February 2015 to reduce our global workforce in an effort to streamline our operations and reduce our cost structure. We also retain independent contractors to provide various services. Except with respect to some of our foreign subsidiaries, we are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements. Some of our foreign subsidiaries are subject to collective bargaining agreements whose benefits and terms are codified and required under local labor laws. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.\nExecutive Officers of the Registrant\nThe following table sets forth information with respect to our executive officers as of May 31, 2015:\nName\nAge\nPosition Held\nJohn Barbour\nChief Executive Officer\nRaymond L.

RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, including those described below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. In addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC, the following risk factors should be considered carefully before you decide whether to buy, hold or sell our common stock. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business, financial conditions, results of operations and stock price.\nOur business depends on our ability to correctly predict highly changeable consumer preferences and product trends.\nThe preferences and interests of children and families evolve quickly, can change drastically from year to year and are difficult to predict. Even our successful products typically have a relatively short period of high demand followed by a decrease in demand as the product matures. We depend on our ability to correctly identify changing consumer sentiments well in advance and supply new products that respond to such changes on a timely basis. We also rely on our ability to identify third-party entertainment media that is likely to be popular with consumers and license rights to such media to incorporate into our products. In addition, we need to be able to accurately forecast sales of these products in order to optimize our production schedules and manage our inventory. Since our products typically have a long development cycle, in some cases lasting over a year, it can be difficult to correctly predict changing consumer preferences and accurately forecast optimal production and sales targets for these products. If we are unable to correctly predict consumer preferences, successfully integrate popular third-party media with our own or accurately forecast sales targets for our products, it could negatively impact our current and future operating results. For example, net sales of our both our LeapPad and LeapTV platforms in fiscal 2015 were below our expectations, resulting in higher than anticipated inventory levels of the products at fiscal year-end and operating results that substantially underperformed our expectations.\nTo remain competitive and stimulate consumer demand, we must continue to develop new products and services and successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions.\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which we compete, we must continually introduce new products and services, enhance existing products and services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. We cannot be sure that any new products or services will be widely accepted and purchased by consumers or that we will be able to successfully manage product introductions and transitions. Failure by consumers to accept our new products and services or to pay a higher price for some of our key products, or our failure to manage product introductions and transitions, could adversely affect our operating results. For example, consumer demand and acceptance of our LeapTV platform in fiscal 2015 was below our expectations, resulting in higher than anticipated inventory levels of the product at year end and contributing to our lower than anticipated financial results.\nIf inventory levels are too high, or if we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels to deliver our products to our customers in sufficient quantities, or on a timely basis, or our operating results will be adversely affected.\nThe high degree of seasonality of our business places stringent demands on our product planning, inventory forecasting and production planning processes. This inventory management approach may be particularly challenging when combined with \u201cjust-in-time\u201d inventory management systems commonly used by retailers to minimize their inventory levels. If we fail to meet tight shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with retailers, increase our shipping costs or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. In order to be able to deliver our merchandise on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. This requires us to begin to place orders for components up to a year in advance, and we produce a significant amount of product months in advance, of the holiday season. At the time these orders are being placed and product is being produced, we generally do not have firm orders from retailers or a complete understanding of what the consumer demand for those products will be in the holiday season. If our product planning, inventory forecasting and production planning processes result in our manufacturing inventory in excess of the levels demanded by our customers, we could be required to record inventory write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory, which would adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if our processes result in our inventory levels being too low to meet customer demand, or if we fail to meet tight shipping deadlines, we may lose sales or increase our shipping costs, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe rely on a small group of retailers that together accounted for the majority of our annual gross sales such that economic or other difficulties that affect these retailers or changes in their purchasing or related decisions could have a significant impact on our business and operating results.\nOur top four retailers in the year ended March 31, 2015 were Wal-Mart, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, Target and Amazon, which, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 70%, 60%, 73% and 73% of the U.S. segment\u2019s gross sales for the year ended March 31, 2015, the three months ended March 31, 2014, and the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These top four retailers, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 30%, 25%, 36% and 34% of the international segment\u2019s gross sales for the year ended March 31, 2015, the three months ended March 31, 2014, and the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In addition, these top four retailers, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 56%, 47%, 61% and 61% of our consolidated gross sales for the year ended March 31, 2015, the three months March 31, 2014 and the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. For the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to rely on a small number of large retailers for the majority of our sales domestically and abroad.\nWe do not have long-term agreements with any of our retailers and retailers make all purchases by delivering one-time purchase orders. As a result, pricing, shelf space, cooperative advertising or special promotions, among other things, with each retailer are subject to periodic negotiation and alteration. In addition, Wal-Mart and Target have from time to time reduced the shelf space allocated to the electronic learning aids aisle within the toy department, which is where our multimedia platforms are merchandized and which may negatively impact our sales at these retailers.\nIn addition, we rely on our retail customers to successfully sell our products to consumers. Economic and other factors that adversely affect retailers, such as increased competition from online retailers, store closures, consolidation in the retail sector, bankruptcies and liquidity problems may adversely affect us. For example, the bankruptcy of Target Canada in 2014 resulted in bad debt expense of approximately $0.4 million. If any of these retailers reduce their purchases from us, reduce our shelf space at retail, materially change the terms on which we conduct business with them or experience a downturn in their business for any reason, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf global economic conditions deteriorate, our business and financial results could be affected.\nWe develop and distribute educational entertainment for children. Our performance can be materially impacted by the overall level of discretionary consumer spending. Consumers\u2019 discretionary purchases of educational entertainment items for children may be impacted by unemployment, foreclosures, bankruptcies, reduced access to credit, interest rates, stagnant or declining wages, and other macroeconomic factors that affect consumer spending behavior. The current economic recovery in the U.S. may not be sustainable or may not be sufficiently broad-based to increase the spending throughout our consumer base. In addition, uncertainty with respect to national debt levels in the member states of the European Union, such as Greece, may pose a significant threat to the global economy as a whole. If these or other matters led to a deterioration of global economic conditions, it could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nIf our marketing and advertising efforts fail to resonate with our customers, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur products are marketed through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs. Our ability to sell our products and services is dependent in part upon the success of these programs. Additionally, given the importance of sales during the year-end holiday season, our marketing efforts tend to be concentrated in the quarter ending December 31. With this concentration, it can be more difficult to accurately assess the effectiveness of the advertising and make any necessary adjustments before the end of the December quarter. If the marketing for our products and services fails to resonate with consumers, particularly during the critical holiday season or during other key selling periods, or if we are unable to accurately assess the effectiveness of our advertising and make necessary adjustments, our business and operating results could be materially affected.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our sales and market share could decline.\nWe currently compete in the learning toy and electronic learning-aids categories of the U.S. and international toy market, with makers of children\u2019s tablets and, to an increasing extent, with general purpose tablets, eBook readers, mobile devices and gaming platforms. Each of these markets is very competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future. The increasing choices for children\u2019s educational entertainment can make it difficult for us to differentiate our products from our competition, causing consumers to select a competitor\u2019s products.\nOur LeapPad products face increasing competition from several tablets designed for children and from general-purpose tablets made by major electronics manufacturers. This means that we compete, to an increasing extent, with much larger makers of tablets such as Apple, Samsung and Amazon, as well as more traditional learning toy companies such as VTech, Mattel and Hasbro. Our digital content faces increasing competition from producers of low cost digital content for kids made for general purpose tablets and smart phones. This may adversely impact the prices we charge for content for our proprietary platforms and sales of such content, as well as our ability to charge a premium for any content we offer for Android and iOS tablets. We focus heavily on the educational aspect of our content, ensuring that each piece of content is based on age-appropriate educational curricula. In contrast, many of our competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing. We also face the challenge of competitors introducing similar products or functionality soon after we introduce our new products or product lines, and these competitors may be able to offer their products at lower prices using cheaper manufacturing processes or materials, more limited functionality, or reduced safety features.\nMany of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. If we are is unable to compete effectively or successfully differentiate our products from the competition, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to include intellectual property owned by others in our products, our operating results could suffer.\nAmong our proprietary rights are inbound licenses from third parties for content such as characters, stories, music, illustrations and trade names, and for technologies we incorporate in our products, including key technology used in our LeapReader reading systems. In particular, we rely on our ability to acquire rights to popular entertainment media properties for content on our multimedia learning platforms. Ownership of highly popular children\u2019s properties has become increasingly consolidated with two large entertainment companies: Disney and Viacom. Our continued use of these rights is dependent on our ability to continue to obtain these license rights and at reasonable rates. Any failure to do so could significantly impact our content sales or interrupt our supply chain and require us to modify our products or business plans.\nOur success is dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, including senior management, and a recent reduction in force may impede our ability to do so.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel in key functions, including senior management. We compete with many other potential employers in recruiting, hiring and retaining skilled officers and other key employees. Recently, we completed reductions in our workforce to align our employee base and cost structure with our current and anticipated revenues and we have experienced greater turnover in our employee base. These reductions and turnover will result in reallocations of duties and may increase employee uncertainty and discontent and may cause unintended attrition. In addition, it may make it more difficult for us to attract and recruit highly skilled employees. There is no guarantee that we will be able to recruit, hire or retain the senior management, officers and other employees we need to succeed and the reductions in force could make it more difficult to do so.\nOur liquidity may be insufficient to meet the long-term or periodic needs of our business.\nIn addition to cash received from the collection of accounts receivable, from time to time, we may fund our operations and strengthen our liquidity through borrowings under our line of credit. Our line of credit has numerous financial tests and covenants that affect the amount we can borrow, and includes various events of default that could impair our ability to access credit under the credit line. In addition, continued operating losses over an extended period of time may render our cash plus borrowing availability under our line of credit insufficient to fund operations at current levels. Any impairment of our ability to access, or extend the term of, our credit line could increase our cost of capital or limit our ability to secure additional capital to fund our operations should we need it and materially impact our financial results and operations.\nIf we were required to record an impairment charge related to the value of our long-lived assets, or an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur long-lived assets are tested for impairment if indicators of impairment exist. If impairment testing shows that the carrying value of our long-lived assets exceeds their estimated fair values, we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge, which would decrease the carrying value of our long-lived assets, as the case may be, and our results of operations would be adversely affected. For example, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, we recorded a $19.5 million impairment charge against our goodwill and a $36.5 million long-lived assets impairment charge against our property and equipment. We will continue to review the recoverability of our remaining long-lived assets on a quarterly basis, which may result in additional impairment charges in future periods. Our deferred tax assets include net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Each quarter, we determine the probability of realizing the benefits of our deferred tax assets. If we determine that there is not sufficient anticipated future taxable income to realize the benefits of these assets, an additional valuation allowance would be required to reduce the value of our deferred tax assets. Such a reduction could result in additional non-cash expense in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted and our results of operations would be adversely affected. For example, for the year ended March 31, 2015, we recorded a $90.8 million income tax provision as a result of establishing an additional valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets. We will continue to perform these tests and any future adjustments may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is highly seasonal, and our annual operating results depend, in large part, on sales relating to the brief holiday season.\nSales of consumer electronics and toy products in the retail channel are highly seasonal, causing a substantial majority of our sales to retailers to occur during the quarters ending September 30 and December 31. Approximately 76% and 73% of our total net sales occurred during the six months ended December 31 of years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively; and approximately 70% and 75% of our total net sales occurred during the second half of the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. A decline of net sales, in the quarter ending September 30 or December 31 in particular, will have a disproportionate negative impact on our results for the year and can lead to ongoing weakness in sales to retailers well into the following year. Therefore, we may be significantly and adversely affected, in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year, by unforeseen events such as economic crises, strikes, earthquakes, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season.\nSignificant increases in the cost of our components and raw materials or an inability to obtain these in sufficient quantities from our suppliers or alternative sources could negatively impact our financial results.\nBecause some of the components used to make our products currently come from a single or a limited number of suppliers, we are subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components that are available from multiple sources are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. If our suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components or raw materials and we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price available from our current suppliers or an alternative source is prohibitive, our ability to maintain timely and cost-effective production of our products would be seriously harmed and our operating results would suffer.\nIn addition, as we do not have long-term agreements with our major suppliers and cannot guarantee their stability, they may stop manufacturing our components at any time with little or no notice. If we are required to use alternative sources, we may be required to redesign some aspects of the affected products, which may involve delays and additional expense. If there are any significant interruptions in the supply of components or if prices rise significantly, we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our finished products or we may be unable to manufacture them at targeted cost levels, and our business and operating results could be harmed.\nOur reliance on a limited number of third-party manufacturers to produce the majority of our products presents risks to our business.\nWe outsource substantially all of our manufacturing to a limited number of Asian manufacturers, most of which manufacture our products at facilities in the Guangdong province in the southeastern region of China. We depend on these manufacturers to produce sufficient volumes of our finished products in a timely fashion, at satisfactory cost and quality levels, and in accordance with our and our customers\u2019 terms of engagement. If we determine that we need to order larger quantities of our products to meet customer demand, we may encounter delays and shortfalls in shipments based on manufacturer capacity issues. Economic and other factors that adversely affect these manufacturers may also adversely affect us. For example, labor costs in China continue to increase due to a variety of factors, including tightening Chinese labor markets, leading to increased prices for us with some of our contract manufacturers. Furthermore, in the past, there have been product quality and safety issues for other producers of toys and other companies that manufacture goods in China. If our manufacturers fail or are unable to produce quality finished products on time, at expected cost targets and in sufficient quantities, or if any of our products are found to be tainted or otherwise raise health or safety concerns, our reputation and operating results would suffer.\nSystem failures in our digital services could harm our business.\nThe digital aspects of our business have grown substantially in strategic importance to our overall business. Any failure to provide a positive user experience in these services could have a negative impact on our reputation, sales and consumer relationships. In addition, we rely on third parties for certain critical aspects of the online user experience, such as payment processing and secure handling of credit card and other confidential information. If consumer demand for accessing our App Center or our website exceeds the capacity we have planned to handle during peak periods or if other technical issues arise, then we could lose sales and customers could be inconvenienced or become dissatisfied with our products. Any significant disruption to or cyber-attack on our App Center, website, internal computer systems, or those of our third-party service providers, or malfunctions related to transaction processing on our content management systems, could result in a loss of potential or existing customers and sales.\nAlthough our systems have been designed to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences, they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, and similar events. Many of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities. Our systems are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism. The occurrence of an earthquake, or other natural disaster or unanticipated problem at our hosting facilities, including those located in California, could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures. Any unplanned disruption of our systems could result in adverse financial impact to our operations.\nWe may not succeed in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property rights and third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where we do not hold patents or trademarks or where the laws may not protect our intellectual property as fully as in the U.S. Some of our products and product features have limited intellectual property protection, and, as a consequence, we may not have the legal right to prevent others from copying and using these features in competitive products. In addition, monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is costly, and any dispute or other litigation, regardless of outcome, may be costly and time-consuming and may divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. However, if we fail to protect or to enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our rights could be diminished and our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our operating results.\nIn addition, we periodically receive claims of infringement or otherwise become aware of potentially relevant patents, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights held by other parties. Responding to any infringement claim, regardless of its validity, may be costly and time-consuming and may divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. If we, our distributors, our licensors or our manufacturers are found to be infringing on the intellectual property rights of any third party, we or they may be required to obtain a license to use those rights, which may not be obtainable on reasonable terms, if at all. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against the development and sale of some of our products or against the use of a trademark or copyright in the sale of some of our products. Our insurance does not cover all types of intellectual property claims and insurance levels for covered claims may not be adequate to indemnify us against all liability, which could harm our operating results.\nAny defects contained in our products, or our failure to comply with applicable safety standards, could result in recalls, delayed shipments, rejection of our products, product liability and damage to our reputation, and could expose us to litigation or regulatory action.\nOur products may contain defects, which could lead to product liability, personal injury or property damage claims, or could result in the rejection of our products by retailers, damage to our reputation, lost sales, and increased customer service and support costs and warranty claims. There is a risk that these claims or liabilities may exceed, or fall outside the scope of, our insurance coverage. Moreover, we may be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future. Concerns about potential public harm and liability may involve involuntary recalls or lead us to voluntarily recall selected products. Recalls or post-manufacture repairs of our products could harm our reputation and our competitive position, increase our costs or reduce our net sales. In addition, recalls or post-manufacturing repairs by other companies in our industry could affect consumer behavior and cause reduced purchases of our products. Any such problems, or perceived problems, with our products could harm our operating results.\nWe face risks associated with international operations.\nWe derived approximately 31%, 31%, 30%, and 27% of our net sales from markets outside the U.S. during the year ended March 31, 2015, the three months ended March 31, 2014 and the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\nOur business is subject to additional risks associated with conducting business internationally, including:\n\u2022 the appeal of our products in international markets;\n\u2022 difficulties managing and maintaining relationships with vendors, customers, retailers, distributors and other commercial partners;\n\u2022 increased investment and operational complexity to make our multimedia platforms and App Center compatible with the systems in various countries and compliant with local laws;\n\u2022 greater difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022 transportation delays and interruptions, including cross-border delays due to customs clearance and other point-of-entry restrictions;\n\u2022 timely localization of products and content;\n\u2022 currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations; and\n\u2022 limitations, including taxes, on the repatriation of earnings.\nOur efforts to increase sales for our products outside the U.S. may not be successful and may not achieve higher sales or gross margins or contribute to profitability. Expansion plans will require significant management attention and resources and may be unsuccessful. We may have to compete with established local or regional companies which understand the local market better than we do. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and places strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. Any difficulties with our international operations could harm our future sales and operating results. In addition, we may not be able to manage international growth effectively, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results.\nWe are subject to international, federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those related to privacy, which could impose additional costs or changes on the conduct of our business.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment with international, federal, state and local governmental entities regulating many aspects of our business. Regulations with which we must comply include accounting standards, taxation requirements (including income tax rates, tariff and import duties, new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations), regulations regarding financial matters, environmental regulations, privacy regulations, regulations regarding advertising directed toward children, safety and other administrative and regulatory restrictions. Our international business requires compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and similar laws. We are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and other similar federal, state and international regulatory authorities, some of which have conflicting standards and requirements. In addition, numerous states have enacted, and many others are considering enacting, laws directed at manufacturers regarding recycling of electronic products and the disclosure of the chemical composition of consumer products, including toys. Compliance with the various laws and regulations and other requirements of regulatory authorities imposes significant costs on the conduct of our business.\nChanges to privacy regulations in the U.S. or Europe could have a significant impact on our business, as a growing percentage of our sales come from our digital multimedia learning platforms and related content. As we focus on digital products and direct marketing to consumers through the Internet, regulatory changes regarding the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy-related matters, could negatively affect our business. Furthermore, consumer concerns regarding such matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and operating results.\nWhile we take steps that we believe are necessary to comply with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we have achieved compliance or that we will be in compliance in the future. Failure to comply with the relevant regulations could result in monetary liabilities and other sanctions, and could lead to significant negative media attention and consumer dissatisfaction, either of which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes in laws or regulations may lead to increased costs, changes in our effective tax rate, or the interruption of normal business operations that would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nPolitical developments, changes in trade relations, the threat or occurrence of armed hostilities, terrorism, labor strikes, natural disasters or public health issues could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is international in scope. The deterioration of the political or socioeconomic situation in a country in which we have significant sales, operations or third-party manufacturers or suppliers, or the breakdown of trade relations between the U.S. and a foreign country in which we have or utilize significant manufacturing facilities or have other operations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, a change in trade status for China, where the vast majority of our contract manufacturers are located, could result in a substantial increase in the import duty of toys manufactured in China and imported into the U.S. In addition, armed hostilities, terrorism, natural disasters, or public health issues, whether in the U.S. or abroad, could cause damage and disruption to our company, our suppliers, our manufacturers, or our customers or could create political or economic instability, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business. For example, our U.S. distribution center and our corporate headquarters are located in California near major earthquake faults that have experienced earthquakes in the past and that are expected to recur in the future. See also \u201cSystem failures in our online services or web store could harm our business\u201d above. Although it is impossible to predict the consequences of any such events, they could result in a decrease in demand for our product or create delay or inefficiencies in our supply chain by making it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products to our customers, for our manufacturers to deliver products to us, or for suppliers to provide component parts.\nFailure to successfully implement new strategic operating initiatives could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe continually evaluate the opportunity to improve our business processes in a variety of ways. For example, in the recent past, we have undertaken initiatives to change our fiscal year, update our enterprise resource planning system, reduce our costs, increase our efficiency, enhance product safety, and simplify processes. These initiatives involve investment of capital and complex decision-making as well as extensive and intensive execution, and the success of these initiatives is not assured. Failure to successfully implement any of these initiatives, or the failure of any of these initiatives to produce the results anticipated by management, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may engage in acquisitions, mergers, or dispositions, which may affect our financial results.\nWe may engage in acquisitions, mergers or dispositions, which may affect the profit, revenues, profit margins, debt-to-capital ratio, capital expenditures, or other aspects of our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets or merger partners or that, if identified, we will be able to acquire these targets on terms acceptable to us and to potential merger partners. There can also be no assurance that we will be successful in integrating any acquired company into our overall operations, or that any such acquired company will operate profitably or will not otherwise adversely impact our results of operations. Further, we cannot be certain that key talented individuals at those acquired companies will continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they will continue to develop popular and profitable products or services.\nA few stockholders control a significant percentage of our voting power.\nThe majority of holders of our Class A common stock may not be able to affect the outcome of any stockholder vote. Our Class A common stock entitles its holders to one vote per share, and our Class B common stock entitles its holders to ten votes per share on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders.\nAs of March 31, 2015, Michael Milken and Lowell Milken together owned, directly and indirectly, approximately 3.6 million shares of our Class B common stock and Sandra Milken beneficially owned 0.8 million shares of our Class B common stock. Together, these three stockholders represented approximately 39.9% of the combined voting power of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock as of March 31, 2015. As a result, Messrs. Michael and Lowell Milken, and Ms. Milken, if voting together would have significant influence on stockholder vote outcomes, including with respect to:\n\u2022 the composition of our board of directors and, through it, any determination with respect to our business direction and policies, including the appointment and removal of officers;\n\u2022 any determinations with respect to mergers, other business combinations, or changes in control;\n\u2022 our acquisition or disposition of assets; and\n\u2022 our financing activities.\nMessrs. Michael and Lowell Milken and Ms. Milken could have interests that diverge from those of our other stockholders. This significant influence by a few stockholders could depress the market price of our Class A common stock; deter, delay or prevent a change in control of LeapFrog; or affect other significant corporate transactions that otherwise might be viewed as beneficial for other stockholders.\nOur stock price has been subject to volatility.\nOur stock has and may continue to experience substantial price volatility. Our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executives and technical, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative personnel. Part of our compensation package is equity based. To the extent our stock performs poorly, it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract key employees, potentially resulting in lost institutional knowledge and key talent. In addition, a significant drop in the price of our stock could expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources. For example, the Company is currently defending itself against a securities class action lawsuit and has been named as a nominal defendant in a related stockholder derivative lawsuit. Continued stock price volatility could harm our ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel by reducing the value of our equity compensation and could subject us to additional litigation.", "PERMNO": 89471, "SIC": 3944, "TIC": "LF"}
