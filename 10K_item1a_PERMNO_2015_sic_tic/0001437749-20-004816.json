Risk Factors\nIf economic trends reverse or recession returns, our credit risk will increase and there could be greater loan losses.\nA reversal in economic trends or return to a recession is likely to result in a higher rate of business closures and increased job losses in the region in which we do business. In addition, reduced state funding for the public colleges and universities that are large employers in our market area could have an adverse effect on employment levels and on the area\u2019s economy. These factors would increase the likelihood that more of our customers would become delinquent or default on their loans. A higher level of loan defaults could result in higher loan losses, which could adversely affect our result of operations and financial condition.\nA reversal in economic trends, return to recession, or change in interest rates could increase the risk of losses in our investment portfolio.\nThe Company holds both corporate and municipal bonds in its investment portfolio. A reversal in economic trends or return to recession could increase the actual or perceived risk of default by both corporate and government issuers and, in either case, could adversely affect the value of these investments. In addition, the value of these investments could be adversely affected by a change in interest rates and related factors, including the pricing of securities.\nA decline in the condition of the local real estate market could negatively affect our business.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s real property collateral is located in its market area. If there is a decline in real estate values, especially in the Company\u2019s market area, the collateral for loans would deteriorate and provide significantly less security to the Company. In the event the Company forecloses on a loan that is collateralized with property having reduced market value, the Company may suffer a recovery loss.\nFocus on lending to small to mid-sized community-based businesses may increase our credit risk.\nMost of the Company\u2019s commercial business and commercial real estate loans are made to small business or middle market customers. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities and have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. If general economic conditions in the market areas in which the Company operates negatively impact this important customer sector, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Moreover, a portion of these loans have been made by the Company in recent years and the borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle since becoming borrowers of the Bank. The deterioration of the borrowers\u2019 businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nWhen market interest rates change, our net interest income can be negatively affected in the short term.\nThe direction and speed of interest rate changes affect our net interest margin and net interest income. In the short term, rising interest rates may negatively affect our net interest income if our interest-bearing liabilities (generally deposits) reprice sooner than our interest-earning assets (generally loans). Falling interest rates may negatively affect our net interest income if our interest-earning assets reprice sooner than our interest-bearing liabilities.\nThe allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nIn accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, an allowance for loan losses is maintained to provide for probable loan losses. The allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual credit losses, and future provisions for credit losses could materially and adversely affect operating results. The allowance for loan losses is based on prior experience, as well as an evaluation of the risks in the current portfolio. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating, and other outside forces and conditions, including changes in interest rates, all of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control; and these losses may exceed current estimates. Federal regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review the Company\u2019s loans and allowance for loan losses. The Company also outsources an independent loan review. While management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover current probable losses, it cannot make assurances that it will not further increase the allowance for loan losses or that regulators will not require it to increase this allowance. Either of these occurrences could adversely affect earnings.\nThe allowance for loan losses requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. Due to the inherent nature of this estimate, management cannot provide assurance that it will not significantly increase the allowance for loan losses, which could materially and adversely affect earnings.\nNonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s nonperforming assets adversely affect its net income in various ways. The Company expects to continue to incur additional losses relating to volatility in nonperforming loans. The Company does not record interest income on nonaccrual loans, which adversely affects its income and increases credit administration costs. When the Company receives collateral through foreclosures and similar proceedings, it is required to mark the related asset to the then fair market value of the collateral less estimated selling costs, which may, and often does, result in a loss. An increase in the level of nonperforming assets also increases the Company\u2019s risk profile and may impact the capital levels regulators believe are appropriate in light of such risks. The Company utilizes various techniques such as workouts and restructurings to manage problem assets. Increases in or negative adjustments in the value of these problem assets, the underlying collateral, or in the borrowers\u2019 performance or financial condition, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant commitments of time from management and staff, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities, including generation of new loans. There can be no assurance that the Company will avoid further increases in nonperforming loans in the future.\nThe Company relies upon independent appraisals to determine the value of the real estate which secures a significant portion of its loans, and the values indicated by such appraisals may not be realizable if the Company is forced to foreclose upon such loans.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio consists of loans secured by real estate. The Company relies upon independent appraisers to estimate the value of such real estate. Appraisals are only estimates of value and the independent appraisers may make mistakes of fact or judgment which adversely affect the reliability of their appraisals. In addition, events occurring after the initial appraisal may cause the value of the real estate to increase or decrease. As a result of any of these factors, the real estate securing some of the Company\u2019s loans may be more or less valuable than anticipated at the time the loans were made. If a default occurs on a loan secured by real estate that is less valuable than originally estimated, the Company may not be able to recover the outstanding balance of the loan and will suffer a loss.\nIf competition increases, our business could suffer.\nThe financial services industry is highly competitive, with a number of commercial banks, credit unions, insurance companies, stockbrokers and other nonbank financial service providers seeking to do business with our customers. If there is additional competition from new business or if our existing competitors focus more attention on our market, we could lose customers and our business could suffer.\nAdditional laws and regulations, or revisions and rescission of existing laws and regulations, could lead to a significant increase in our regulatory burden.\nBoth federal and state governments could enact new laws and regulations affecting financial institutions that would further increase our regulatory burden and could negatively affect our profits. Likewise, revisions or rescission of existing laws and regulations already implemented may result in additional compliance costs, at least in the short term or, if done imprudently, could ultimately create economic risks negatively affecting our revenues.\nIntense oversight by regulators could result in stricter requirements and higher overhead costs.\nRegulators for the Company and the Bank are tasked with ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Laws and regulations are subject to a degree of interpretation. If financial industry regulators take more extreme interpretations, the Company\u2019s earnings could be adversely impacted.\nPolitical, economic and social risks in the U.S. and the rest of the world could negatively affect the financial markets.\nPolitical, economic and social risks in the U.S. and the rest of the world could affect financial markets and affect fiscal policy which could negatively affect our investment portfolio and earnings.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or security breach.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions of our internet banking, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if it does occur, that it will be adequately addressed.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees, in systems and on networks. The secure processing, maintenance and use of this information is critical to the Company\u2019s operations and business strategy. The Company has invested in industry-accepted technologies, and annually reviews its processes and practices that are designed to protect its networks, computers and data from damage or unauthorized access. Despite these security measures, the Company\u2019s computer systems experienced two cyber-intrusions, one in May 2016 and one in January 2017 in which certain customer information was compromised, but which did not cause interruption to the Company\u2019s normal operations. The Company has implemented additional security measures since the breaches. The Company\u2019s computer systems and infrastructure may in the future be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. A breach of any kind could compromise systems and the information stored there could be accessed, damaged or disclosed. The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of our communications and information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability.\nCyber-attacks may disarm and/or bypass system safeguards and allow unauthorized access and misappropriation of financial data and assets.\nAs a financial institution, we are vulnerable to and the target of cyber-attacks that attempt to access our digital technology systems, disarm and/or bypass system safeguards, access customer data and ultimately increase the risk of economic and reputational loss.\nThe Company experienced two cyber-intrusions, one in May 2016 and one in January 2017 in which certain customer information was compromised. The Company has strengthened its multi-faceted approach to reduce the exposure of our systems to cyber-intrusions, strengthen our defenses against hackers and protect customer accounts and information relevant to customer accounts from unauthorized access. These tools include digital technology safeguards, internal policies and procedures, and employee training.\nThe Company believes its cybersecurity risk management program reasonably addresses the risk from cybersecurity attacks. However, it is not possible to fully eliminate exposure. We may experience human error or have unknown susceptibilities that allow our systems to become victim to a highly-sophisticated cyber-attack. If hackers gain entry to our systems, they may disable other safeguards that limit loss, including limits on the number, amount and frequency of automated teller machine (\u201cATM\u201d) withdrawals, as well as other loss-prevention or detection measures.\nCybersecurity attacks are probable and may result in additional costs.\nThe Company has experienced many attempted cybersecurity attacks, of which two resulted in a breach. The Company estimates that the probability of future attempted cyber-attacks is high. To reduce the risk of loss from cyber-attacks and to remediate vulnerabilities discovered through the breach investigations, the Company has incurred costs related to forensic investigations, legal and advisory expenses, insurance premiums, system monitoring and testing, and installing new technological infrastructure and defenses. The Company has implemented every recommendation from the forensic investigations. If the Company experiences another cyber-breach, these costs will increase and the Company will also likely incur additional litigation, reputational harm and regulatory costs.\nInsurance may not cover losses from cybersecurity attacks.\nThe Company has invested in insurance related to cybersecurity. Insurance policies are necessary to protect the Company from major losses but may be written in such a way as to limit the protection from certain risks, including cyber risks for which the availability of insurance coverage is currently limited. If the insurance carrier denies coverage of losses the Company may litigate, resulting in additional legal expense. Because of policy technicalities, litigation may not result in a favorable outcome for the Company.\nThe Company relies on other companies to provide key components of the Company\u2019s business infrastructure.\nThird parties provide key components of the Company\u2019s business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, internet connections and network access. While the Company has selected these third party vendors carefully, it does not control their actions. Any problem caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, failures of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third party vendor could also hurt the Company\u2019s operations if those difficulties interface with the vendor\u2019s ability to serve the Company. Replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay and expense and damage the Company\u2019s ability to service its customers, resulting in a loss of customer goodwill. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to the Company\u2019s business operations.\nConsumers may increasingly decide not to use the Bank to complete their financial transactions, which would have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operations.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts, mutual funds or general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in funding for higher education could materially affect our business.\nTwo major employers in the Company\u2019s market area are Virginia Tech and Radford University, both state-supported institutions. If federal or state support for public colleges and universities wanes, our business may be adversely affected from declines in university programs, capital projects, employment, enrollment and other related factors.\nThe Company is dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and prospects.\nThe Company currently depends on the services of a number of key management personnel. The loss of key personnel could materially and adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s success also depends in part on the ability to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel. Competition for such personnel is strong and the Company may not be successful in attracting or retaining the personnel it requires.\nChanges in accounting standards could impact reported earnings.\nThe authorities who promulgate accounting standards, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board, SEC, and other regulatory authorities, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. These changes are difficult to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of financial statements for prior periods. Such changes could also require the Company to incur additional personnel or technology costs. Notably, guidance issued in June 2016 requires a change in the calculation of credit reserves from using an incurred loss model to using the current expected credit losses model (\u201cCECL\u201d). During 2019, the standard\u2019s effective date was delayed for the Company and other qualifying institutions until January 1, 2023. The Company formed a management committee to prepare for the new standard. The committee implemented data collection measures, researched forecasting resources, studied applicable loss calculations and has begun running preliminary CECL models concurrent with the incurred loss model. The committee will analyze the CECL disclosures of companies who adopt the standard effective January 1, 2020 for consideration in further refining its CECL calculations. To implement the standard, the Company will incur costs related to data collection and documentation, technology, training and increased audit expenses to validate the model. Implementation could significantly impact our required credit reserves. Other impacts to capital levels, profit and loss and various financial metrics will also result.\nThe Company is subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility.\nFrom time to time, customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to the performance of the Company\u2019s fiduciary responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal action related to the performance of the Company\u2019s fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of the Company and its products and services, as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends depends upon the results of operations of its subsidiaries.\nThe Company is a financial holding company and a bank holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through NBB. As a result, the Company\u2019s ability to make dividend payments on its common stock depends primarily on certain federal regulatory considerations and the receipt of dividends and other distributions from NBB. There are various regulatory restrictions on the ability of NBB to pay dividends or make other payments to the Company. Although the Company has historically paid a cash dividend to the holders of its common stock, holders of the common stock are not entitled to receive dividends, and regulatory or economic factors may cause the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to consider, among other things, the reduction of dividends paid on the Company\u2019s common stock.\nWhile the Company\u2019s common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, it has less liquidity than stocks for larger companies quoted on a national securities exchange.\nThe trading volume in the Company\u2019s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market has been relatively low when compared with larger companies listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market or other stock exchanges. There is no assurance that a more active and liquid trading market for the common stock will exist in the future. Consequently, stockholders may not be able to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which stockholders could sell a smaller number of shares. In addition, the Company cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of its common stock in the market, or the availability of shares of common stock for sale in the market, will have on the market price of the common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the market, or the potential for large amounts of sales in the market, could cause the price of the Company\u2019s common stock to decline, or reduce the Company\u2019s ability to raise capital through future sales of common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s liquidity needs could adversely affect results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s primary sources of funds are deposits and loan repayments. While scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, they are subject to the ability of borrowers to repay the loans. The ability of borrowers to repay loans can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, changes in economic conditions, reductions in real estate values or markets, availability of, and/or access to, sources of refinancing, business closings or lay-offs, and natural disasters. Additionally, deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, regulatory capital requirements, returns available to customers on alternative investments and general economic conditions. Accordingly, the Company may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations. Such sources include Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (\u201cFHLB\u201d) advances, sales of securities and loans, federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks and borrowings from the Federal Reserve Discount Window, as well as additional out-of-market time deposits and brokered deposits. While the Company believes that these sources are currently adequate, there can be no assurance they will be sufficient to meet future liquidity demands, particularly if the Company continues to grow and experiences increasing loan demand. The Company may be required to slow or discontinue loan growth, capital expenditures or other investments or liquidate assets should such sources not be adequate.\nNatural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, the impact of health epidemics and other adverse external events could detrimentally affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nNatural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, and other adverse external events could have a significant negative impact on our ability to conduct business or upon third parties who perform operational services for us or our customers. Such events also could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in lost revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses.\nThe recent coronavirus outbreak could negatively impact the ability of our employees and customers to engage in banking and other financial transactions in the geographic areas in which the Company operates. The Company also could be adversely affected if key personnel or a significant number of employees were to become unavailable due to a coronavirus outbreak in our market areas. Although the Company has business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, there is no assurance that such plans and safeguards will be effective. In the event of a natural disaster, the spread of the coronavirus to our market areas or other adverse external events, our business, services, asset quality, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe effects of widespread public health emergencies may negatively affect our local economies or disrupt our operations, which would have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWidespread health emergencies, such as the recent coronavirus outbreak, can disrupt our operations through their impact on our employees, customers and their businesses, and the communities in which we operate. Disruptions to our customers could result in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures and losses on our loans, negatively impact regional economic conditions, result in a decline in local loan demand, loan originations and deposit availability and negatively impact the implementation of our growth strategy. Any one or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 87505, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "NKSH"}
