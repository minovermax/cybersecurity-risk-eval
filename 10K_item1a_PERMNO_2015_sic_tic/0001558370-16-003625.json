{"cik": "894405", "company": "ARCBEST CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nThe nature of the business activities we conduct subjects us to certain hazards and risks. This Risk Factors section discusses some of the material risks relating to our business activities, including business risks affecting the transportation industry in general as well as risks specific to our company that are largely out of our control. Other risks are described in \u201cItem 1. Business - Freight Transportation (ABF Freight) Segment - Competition, Pricing, and Industry Factors\u201d and \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d These risks are not the only risks we face. We may also be negatively impacted by a sustained interruption in our systems or operations, including, but not limited to, infrastructure damage, the loss of a key location such as a distribution center, or a significant disruption to the electric grid, or by a significant decline in demand for our services, each of which may arise from adverse weather conditions or natural calamities; illegal acts, including terrorist attacks; and/or other market disruptions. Our business could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial. If any of these risks or circumstances actually occurs, it could materially harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations and impair our ability to implement business plans or complete development activities as scheduled. In that case, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nWe are dependent on our information technology systems, and a systems failure, data breach, or other cybersecurity incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information technology systems in operating our business. Our information technology systems are critical to understanding customer demands, accepting and planning loads, dispatching equipment and drivers, and billing and collecting for our services as well as producing accurate and timely financial statements and analyzing information to help us manage our business efficiently and effectively. Cybersecurity attacks and cyber incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy, or other proper functioning of these systems or that result in confidential data being compromised could have a significant impact on our operations. We utilize certain software applications provided by third parties, or provide underlying data which is utilized by third parties to provide certain outsourced administrative functions, either of which may increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident. A significant cyber incident, including denial of service, system failure, security breach, intentional or inadvertent acts by employees, disruption by malware, or other damage, could interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers, cause errors or delays in financial reporting, expose us to a risk of loss or litigation, and/or cause us to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nCertain of our information technology needs are provided by third parties, and we have limited control over the operation, quality, or maintenance of services provided by our vendors or whether they will continue to provide services that are essential to our business. The efficient and uninterrupted operation of our information technology systems depends upon the Internet, global communications providers, satellite-based communications systems, the electric grid, electric utility providers, and telecommunications providers; and our information technology systems are vulnerable to interruption by adverse weather conditions or natural calamities, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, Internet failures, computer viruses, and other events beyond our control. Disruptions or failures in the services upon which our information technology platforms rely, or in other services provided to us by outside service providers upon which we rely to operate our business and report financial results, may adversely affect our operations and the services we provide, which could increase our costs or result in a loss of customers that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we license a variety of software that supports our operations, and thus these operations depend on our ability to maintain these licenses. We have no guarantees that we will be able to continue these licensing arrangements with the current licensors, or that we can replace the functions provided by these licenses, on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nWe could be obligated to make additional significant contributions to multiemployer pension plans.\nABF Freight contributes to multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans to provide benefits for its contractual employees. ABF Freight\u2019s contributions generally are based on the time worked by its contractual employees in accordance with its collective bargaining agreement with the IBT and other related supplemental agreements.\nThe multiemployer plans to which ABF Freight contributes, which have been established pursuant to the Taft-Hartley Act, are jointly-trusteed (half of the trustees of each plan are selected by the participating employers, the other half by the IBT)\nand cover collectively-bargained employees of multiple unrelated employers. Due to the inherent nature of multiemployer pension plans, there are risks associated with participation in these plans that differ from single-employer plans. Assets received by the plans are not segregated by employer, and contributions made by one employer can be and are used to provide benefits to current and former employees of other employers. If a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan no longer contributes to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. If a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan completely withdraws from the plan, it owes to the plan its proportionate share of the plan\u2019s unfunded vested benefits, referred to as a withdrawal liability. A complete withdrawal generally occurs when the employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute to the plan. A withdrawal liability is also owed in the event the employer withdraws from a plan in connection with a mass withdrawal, which generally occurs when all or substantially all employers withdraw from the plan pursuant to an agreement in a relatively short period of time. Were ABF Freight to completely withdraw from certain multiemployer pension plans, whether in connection with a mass withdrawal or otherwise, under current law, it would have material liabilities for its share of the unfunded vested liabilities of each such plan.\nThe 25 multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes vary greatly in size and in funded status. ABF Freight\u2019s contribution obligations to these plans are specified in the ABF NMFA, which was implemented on November 3, 2013 and extends through March 31, 2018. The funding obligations to the multiemployer pension plans are intended to satisfy the requirements imposed by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the \u201cPPA\u201d), which was permanently extended by the Reform Act under the CFCAA. Through the term of its current collective bargaining agreement, ABF Freight\u2019s contribution obligations generally will be satisfied by making the specified contributions when due. However, we cannot determine with any certainty the contributions that will be required under future collective bargaining agreements for our contractual employees.\nSeveral of the multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes are underfunded and, in some cases, significantly underfunded. The underfunded status of these plans developed over many years, and we believe that an improved funded status will also take time to be achieved. In addition, the highly competitive industry in which we operate could impact the viability of contributing employers. The reduction or loss of contributions by member employers, the impact of market risk on plan assets and liabilities, and the effect of any one or combination of the aforementioned business risks, which are outside our control, have the potential to adversely affect the funded status of the multiemployer pension plans, potential withdrawal liabilities, and our future contribution requirements.\nBased on the most recent annual funding notices we have received, most of which are for plan years ended December 31, 2014, approximately 64% of ABF Freight\u2019s contributions to multiemployer pension plans are made to plans that are in \u201ccritical status\u201d (generally less than 65% funded), including the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan (the \u201cCentral States Pension Plan\u201d), and approximately 3% of our contributions are made to plans that are in \u201cendangered status\u201d (generally more than 65% but less than 80% funded), as defined by the PPA.\nApproximately one-half of ABF Freight\u2019s multiemployer pension contributions are made to the Central States Pension Plan. The funded percentage of the Central States Pension Plan, as set forth in information provided by the Central States Pension Plan, was 47.9%, 48.4%, and 47.6% as of January 1, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. In 2005, the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) granted an extension of the period of time over which the Central States Pension Plan amortizes unfunded liabilities by ten years, subject to the condition that a targeted funding ratio is maintained by the plan. Based on information currently available to us, the Central States Pension Plan has not received notice of revocation of the ten-year amortization extension granted by the IRS. In the unlikely event that the IRS were to revoke the extension, the revocation would apply retroactively to the 2004 plan year, which would result in a material liability for ABF Freight\u2019s share of the resulting funded deficiency, the extent of which is currently unknown to us.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and our business could suffer if we are unable to adequately address downward pricing pressures and other factors that could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete in the transportation industry.\nWe face significant competition in local, regional, national, and, to a lesser extent, international markets. ABF Freight competes with many other LTL carriers of varying sizes, including both union and nonunion LTL carriers and, to a lesser extent, with truckload carriers and railroads. Our Panther and ABF Logistics businesses compete with domestic and global logistics service providers which compete in one or more segments of the transportation industry. Numerous factors could adversely impact our ability to compete effectively in the transportation and logistics industry, retain our existing\ncustomers, or attract new customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These competitive factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nSome of our competitors have greater capital resources, a lower cost structure, greater market share, or a broader coverage network than we do or have other competitive advantages.\n\u00b7\nOur nonunion competitors generally have a lower fringe benefit cost structure for their freight-handling and driving personnel than union carriers, and our nonunion competitors may have greater operating flexibility. Wage and benefit concessions granted to certain union competitors allow for a lower cost structure than ours and may impact our competitiveness in the LTL industry.\n\u00b7\nSome of our competitors, such as railroads, are outside the motor carrier freight transportation industry, and certain challenges specific to the motor carrier freight transportation industry, including the competitive freight rate environment; capacity restraints in times of growing freight volumes; increased costs and potential shortages of commercial truck drivers; changes to driver hours-of-service requirements; increased costs of fuel and other operating expenses; and costs of compliance with existing and potential legal and environmental regulations, could result in the service offerings of these competitors being more competitive.\n\u00b7\nSome of our competitors periodically reduce their prices to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which limits our ability to maintain or increase prices. If customers select transportation service providers based on price alone rather than the total value offered, we may be unable to maintain our operating margins or to maintain or grow tonnage levels.\n\u00b7\nCustomers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process may depress prices or result in the loss of some business to competitors.\n\u00b7\nCustomers may reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting \u201ccore carriers\u201d as approved transportation service providers, and in some instances, we may not be selected.\n\u00b7\nCertain of our competitors may offer a broader portfolio of services or more effectively bundle their service offerings, which could impair our ability to maintain or grow our share of one or more markets in which we compete.\n\u00b7\nCompetition in the LTL industry from asset-light logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect customer relationships and prices in our ABF Freight operations. Conversely, our ABF Logistics and Panther businesses may be adversely impacted if customers develop their own logistics operations, thus reducing demand for our services, or if shippers shift business to truckload brokerage companies or asset-based trucking companies that also offer brokerage services in order to secure access to those companies\u2019 trucking capacity, particularly in times of tight industry-wide capacity.\n\u00b7\nThe trend toward consolidation in the transportation industry could continue to create larger LTL carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size. ABF Freight could experience some competitive difficulties if the remaining LTL carriers, in fact, realize advantages because of their size. Industry consolidations could also result in our competitors providing a more comprehensive set of services at competitive prices, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\u00b7\nBased on economic conditions and industry trends, customers may transition traditional LTL business to truckload shipments. Under certain economic conditions, shipment sizes can increase, prompting shippers to utilize truckload carriers rather than LTL carriers, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our results of operations could be negatively impacted if our long-haul LTL business is reduced by the trend toward truckload consolidation, whereby a customer gathers groups of shipments, which were traditionally transported by long-haul LTL, into full loads which are tendered to a truckload carrier that will transport them to a distant distribution point where they are then transferred to various carriers as short-haul LTL shipments to the ultimate consignees.\n\u00b7\nAdvances in technology may require us to increase investments in order to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to accept higher freight rates to cover the costs of these investments.\nOur business operations are subject to numerous governmental regulations, and costs of compliance with, or liability for violations of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nVarious federal and state agencies exercise broad regulatory powers over the transportation industry, generally governing such activities as operations of and authorization to engage in motor carrier freight transportation, operations of non-vessel-operating common carriers, operations of ocean freight forwarders and ocean transportation intermediaries, safety, contract compliance, insurance and bonding requirements, tariff and trade policies, customs, import and export, employment practices, licensing and registration, taxation, environmental matters, data privacy and security, and financial reporting. We could become subject to new or more restrictive regulations, such as regulations relating to engine emissions,\ndrivers\u2019 hours of service, occupational safety and health, ergonomics, or cargo security. Increases in costs to comply with such regulations or the failure to comply, which could subject us to penalties or revocation of our permits or licenses, could increase our operating expenses or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. Such regulations could also influence the demand for transportation services.\nOur failures, or the failures of our contracted owner operators and third-party carriers, to comply with DOT safety regulations or downgrades in our safety rating could have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition. A downgrade in our safety rating could cause us to lose the ability to self-insure. The loss of our ability to self-insure for any significant period of time could materially increase insurance costs or we could experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage.\nThe FMCSA\u2019s final rule on ELDs became effective in February 2016 and carriers are required to be in compliance with the mandate by December 2017. We have incurred significant costs to equip our fleet with ELDs and we will continue to incur costs to comply with the ELD mandate, which will increase our operating expenses.\nFurther, many states have initiated enforcement programs to evaluate the classification of independent contractors, and class actions and other lawsuits have arisen in our industry seeking to reclassify independent contractor drivers as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers\u2019 compensation, wage-and-hour, and health care coverage. There can be no assurance that legislative, judicial, or regulatory authorities will not introduce proposals or assert interpretations of existing rules and regulations resulting in the reclassification of the owner operators of our Panther segment as employees. In the event of such reclassification of our owner operators, we could be exposed to various liabilities and additional costs and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. These liabilities and additional costs could include exposure, for both future and prior periods, under federal, state, and local tax laws, and workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, and employment laws, as well as potential liability for penalties and interest, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of our Panther segment.\nOur asset-light logistics segments utilize third-party service providers who are subject to similar regulation requirements as previously mentioned. If the operations of these providers are impacted to the extent that a shortage of quality third-party service providers occurs, there could be a material adverse effect on the operating results and business growth of our asset-light logistics segments. Also, activities by these providers that violate applicable laws or regulations could result in government or third party actions against us. Although third-party service providers with whom we contract agree to abide by our policies and procedures, we may not be aware of, and may therefore be unable to remedy, violations by them.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties. The costs of compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations may be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials and similar matters. We may transport or arrange for the transportation of hazardous materials and explosives, and we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination could occur. At certain ABF Freight facilities, we store fuel in underground and aboveground tanks and/or we operate with non-discharge certifications or stormwater permits under the federal Clean Water Act. We may be subject to substantial fines or civil penalties if we fail to obtain proper certifications or permits or if we do not comply with required testing provisions. Our operations involve the risks of, among others, fuel spillage or leakage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal. Under certain environmental laws, we could be subject to strict liability for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites, as well as costs associated with the cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles. Although we have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, violations of applicable laws or regulations may subject us to cleanup costs and liabilities not covered by insurance or in excess of our applicable insurance coverage, including substantial fines, civil penalties, or civil and criminal liability, as well as bans on making future shipments in particular geographic areas, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, if any damage or injury occurs as a result of our transportation of hazardous materials or explosives, we may be subject to claims from third parties and bear liability for such damage or injury.\nConcern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant and increasing legislative and regulatory efforts to limit carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions, and some form(s) of federal, state, or regional climate change legislation is possible in the future. We are unable to determine with any certainty the effects of any future\nclimate change legislation. However, emission-related regulatory actions have historically resulted in increased costs of revenue equipment, diesel fuel, and equipment maintenance, and future legislation, if enacted, could impose substantial costs on us that may adversely impact our results of operations. Such regulatory actions have also required vendors to introduce new engines, and the maintenance demands and reliability of vehicles equipped with these newly designed engines, as well as the residual values realized from the disposition of these vehicles, is uncertain. Such regulatory actions may also require changes in our operating practices and impair equipment productivity. We are also subject to increasing customer sensitivity to sustainability issues, and we may be subject to additional requirements related to customer-led initiatives or their efforts to comply with environmental programs. Until the timing, scope, and extent of any future regulation or customer requirements become known, we cannot predict their effect on our cost structure or our operating results. Furthermore, although we are committed to mandatory and voluntary sustainability practices, increased awareness and any adverse publicity about greenhouse gas emissions emitted by companies in the transportation industry could harm our reputation or reduce customer demand for our services.\nWe may be unsuccessful in realizing all or any part of the anticipated benefits of any recent or future acquisitions.\nAs part of our long-term strategy to ensure we are positioned to serve our customers within the changing marketplace by providing a comprehensive suite of transportation and logistics services, we have strategically invested in our asset-light logistics businesses with the acquisitions of Smart Lines Transportation Group, LLC and Bear Transportation Services, L.P. during 2015. We continue to evaluate acquisition candidates and may acquire assets and businesses that we believe complement our existing assets and business or enhance our service offerings. The processes of evaluating acquisitions and performing due diligence procedures include risks which may adversely impact the success of our selection of candidates, pricing of the transaction, and ability to integrate critical functional areas of the acquired business. Further, we may not be able to acquire any additional companies at all or on terms favorable to us. Certain of our larger, better capitalized competitors may seek to acquire some of the companies we may be interested in, and competition for acquisitions would likely increase acquisition prices and result in us having fewer acquisition opportunities.\nAcquisitions may require substantial capital or the incurrence of substantial indebtedness or may involve the dilutive issuance of equity securities. If we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly. We may be unable to generate sufficient revenue from the operation of an acquired business to offset our acquisition or investment costs. The degree of success of our acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and growth opportunities. Our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this realization depends, in part, upon the successful integration of any acquired businesses. The possible difficulties of integration include, among others: retention of customers, key employees, and third-party service providers; unanticipated issues in the assimilation and consolidation of information, communications, and other systems; consolidation of corporate and administrative infrastructures; difficulties managing businesses that are outside our historical core competency; inefficiencies and difficulties that arise because of unfamiliarity with potentially new markets or geographic areas and new assets and the businesses associated with them; the effect on internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and unanticipated issues, expenses, and liabilities. The risks involved in successful integration could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time. The diversion of management\u2019s attention from our current operations to the acquired operations and any difficulties encountered in combining operations, including underestimation of the resources required to support the acquisitions, could prevent us from realizing the full benefits anticipated from the acquisitions and could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Also, following an acquisition, we may discover previously unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business for which we have no recourse under applicable indemnification provisions. If acquired operations fail to generate sufficient cash flows, we may incur impairments of goodwill, intangibles, and other assets in the future.\nWe depend on our employees to support our business operations and future growth opportunities. If our relationship with our employees deteriorates; if we have difficulty attracting and retaining employees and/or independent owner operators for Panther\u2019s operations; or if ABF Freight is unable to reach agreement on future collective bargaining agreements, we could be faced with labor inefficiencies, disruptions, or stoppages, or delayed growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reduce our operating results, and place us at a further disadvantage relative to nonunion competitors.\nAs of December 2015, approximately 77% of ABF Freight\u2019s employees were covered under the ABF NMFA, the collective bargaining agreement with the IBT which extends through March 31, 2018. The terms of future collective bargaining agreements or the inability to agree on acceptable terms for the next contract period may result in a work\nstoppage, the loss of customers, or other events that could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. We could also experience a loss of customers or a reduction in our potential share of business in the markets we serve if shippers limit their use of unionized freight transportation service providers because of the risk of work stoppages.\nABF Freight operates in a highly competitive industry which consists predominantly of nonunion motor carriers. ABF Freight\u2019s nonunion competitors have a lower fringe benefit cost structure and less stringent labor work rules, and certain carriers also have lower wage rates for their freight-handling and driving personnel. Wage and benefit concessions granted to certain union competitors also allow for a lower cost structure than that of ABF Freight. Under its current collective bargaining agreement, ABF Freight continues to pay some of the highest benefit contribution rates in the industry, which continues to adversely impact our operating results relative to our competitors. We have not historically experienced any significant long-term difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified drivers and freight-handling personnel for ABF Freight, although short-term difficulties have been encountered in certain situations, such as periods of significant increases in tonnage levels, and the available pool of drivers has been declining. Difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and freight-handling personnel or increases in compensation or fringe benefit costs could affect our profitability and our ability to grow. Government regulations or the adverse impact of certain legislative actions which result in shortages of qualified drivers could also impact our ability to grow the company. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified drivers, we could incur higher driver recruiting expenses or a loss of business. In addition to difficulties we may experience in driver retention, if we are unable to effectively manage our relationship with the IBT, we could be less effective in ongoing relations and future negotiations, which could lead to operational inefficiencies and increased operating costs.\nThe driver fleet of our Panther segment is made up of independent owner operators and individuals. We face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified owner operators from the available pool of drivers and fleets, and we may be required to increase owner operator compensation or take other measures to remain an attractive option for owner operators, which may negatively impact our results of operations. If we are not able to maintain our delivery schedules due to a shortage of drivers or if we are required to increase our rates to offset increases in labor costs, our services may be less competitive which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to maintain and grow our business will also depend, in part, on our ability to retain and attract additional sales representatives and other key operational personnel and properly incentivize them to obtain new customers, maintain existing customer relationships, and efficiently manage our business. If we are unable to maintain or expand our sales and operational workforce, our ability to increase our revenues and operate our business could be negatively impacted.\nOur business is cyclical in nature, and we are subject to general economic factors and instability in financial and credit markets that are largely beyond our control, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business is cyclical in nature and tends to reflect general economic conditions. Our performance is affected by recessionary economic cycles, downturns in customers\u2019 business cycles, and changes in their business practices. Our tonnage and shipment levels are directly affected by industrial production and manufacturing, distribution, residential and commercial construction, and consumer spending, in each case, primarily in the North American economy, as well as our customers\u2019 inventory levels and capacity in the trucking industry. Recessionary economic conditions may result in a general decline in demand for freight transportation and logistics services. The pricing environment generally becomes more competitive during periods of slow economic growth and economic recessions, which adversely affects the profit margin for our services. Economic conditions could adversely affect our customers\u2019 business levels, the amount of transportation services they require, and their ability to pay for our services, thus negatively impacting our working capital and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and covenants of our financing arrangements. Because a portion of our costs are fixed, it may be difficult for us to quickly adjust our structure proportionately with fluctuations in volume levels. Customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for uncollectible accounts receivable, and, as a result, we may be required to increase our allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable. For our asset-light logistics businesses, our obligation to pay third-party service providers is not contingent upon payment from our customers, and we extend credit to certain of these customers which increases our exposure to uncollectible receivables.\nWe depend on suppliers for equipment, parts, and services that are critical to our operations. A disruption in the availability or a significant increase in the cost to obtain these supplies, resulting from the effect of adverse economic conditions or\nrelated financial constraints on our suppliers\u2019 business levels or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe are affected by the instability in the financial and credit markets that from time to time has created volatility in various interest rates and returns on invested assets in recent years. We are subject to market risk due to variable interest rates on our accounts receivable securitization program and the revolving credit facility (\u201cCredit Facility\u201d) outstanding under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Although we have an interest rate swap agreement to mitigate a portion of our interest rate risk by effectively converting $50.0 million of borrowings under our Credit Facility, of which $70.0 million remains outstanding at the end of February 2016, from variable-rate interest to fixed-rate interest, changes in interest rates may increase our financing costs related to our Credit Facility, future borrowings against our accounts receivable securitization program, new capital lease or note payable arrangements, or additional sources of financing. Furthermore, future financial market disruptions may adversely affect our ability to refinance our Credit Facility and accounts receivable securitization program, maintain our letter of credit arrangements or, if needed, secure alternative sources of financing. If any of the financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by economic conditions, disruption to the capital and credit markets, or increased regulation, they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to borrow additional funds, and thus have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. (See Note G to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our financing arrangements.)\nOur qualified nonunion defined benefit pension plan trust holds investments in equity and debt securities. Declines in the value of plan assets resulting from instability in the financial markets, general economic downturn, or other economic factors beyond our control could further diminish the funded status of the nonunion defined benefit pension plan and potentially increase our requirement to make contributions to the plan. A change in the interest rates used to calculate our funding requirements under the PPA may impact contributions required to fund our plan. Significant plan contribution requirements could reduce the cash available for working capital and other business needs and opportunities. An increase in required pension plan contributions may adversely impact our financial condition and liquidity. Substantial future investment losses on pension plan assets would increase pension expense in the years following the losses. In addition, a change in the discount rate used to calculate our obligations for our nonunion defined benefit pension plan and postretirement health benefit plan for financial statement purposes would impact the accumulated benefit obligation and expense for these plans. An increase in expense for these pension and postretirement plans may adversely impact our results of operations. We could also experience losses on investments related to our cash surrender value of variable life insurance policies, which may negatively impact our results of operations.\nFurthermore, it is not possible to predict the effects of actual or threatened armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, or political and/or civil unrest on the economy or on consumer confidence in the United States or the impact, if any, on our future results of operations or financial condition.\nOur total assets include goodwill and intangibles. If we determine that these items have become impaired in the future, our earnings could be adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had recorded goodwill of $96.5 million and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $76.8 million. Our goodwill and intangible assets resulted from acquisitions in the asset-light logistics segments, including the acquisition of Panther on June 15, 2012. Panther and ABF Logistics are each evaluated as a separate reporting unit for the impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets. Our annual impairment evaluations of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2015, 2014, and 2013 produced no indication of impairment of the recorded balances. However, significant declines in business levels or other changes in cash flow assumptions or other factors that negatively impact the fair value of the operations of Panther or ABF Logistics could result in impairment and a resulting non-cash write-off of a significant portion of our goodwill and intangible assets, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe depend on services provided by third parties, and increased costs or disruption of these services, and claims arising from these services, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and customer relationships.\nA reduction in the availability of rail services or services provided by third-party capacity providers to meet customer requirements, as well as higher utilization of third-party agents to maintain service levels in periods of tonnage growth, could increase purchased transportation costs which we may be unable to pass along to our customers. If a disruption or\nreduction in transportation services from our rail or other third-party service providers were to occur, we could be faced with business interruptions that could cause us to fail to meet the needs of our customers. In addition, we may not be able to negotiate competitive contracts with railroads to expand our capacity, add additional routes, obtain multiple providers, or obtain railroad services at costs which are acceptable to us or our customers, any of which could limit our ability to provide this service. If these situations occur, our results of operations, cash flows, and customer relationships could be adversely impacted.\nOur ability to secure the services of such third-party service providers is affected by many risks beyond our control. The inability to obtain the services of reliable third parties at competitive prices; the shortage of quality third-party providers, including owner operators for Panther and drivers of contracted truckload carriers for the brokerage operations of ABF Logistics; shortages in available cargo capacity; equipment shortages in the transportation industry, particularly among contracted truckload carriers; changes in regulations impacting transportation; labor disputes; or a significant interruption in service or stoppage in third-party transportation services could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of our asset-light logistics businesses.\nThird-party providers can be expected to increase their prices based on market conditions or to cover increases in operating expenses. These providers are subject to industry regulations which may have a significant impact on their operations, causing them to increase prices or exit the industry. Increased industry demand for these transportation services may reduce available capacity and such a reduction or other changes in these services offered by third parties may increase pricing or otherwise change the services we are able to offer to our customers. If we are unable to correspondingly increase the prices we charge to our customers, or if we are unable to secure sufficient third-party services to meet our commitments to our customers, there could be a material adverse impact on the operations, revenues, and profitability of our asset-light logistics businesses and our customer relationships.\nIn addition, we may be subject to claims arising from services provided by third parties, particularly in connection with our Panther and ABF Logistics operations, which are dependent on third-party contract carriers. From time to time, the drivers who are employees, owner operators, or independent contractors working for third-party carriers that we contract with are involved in accidents that may result in cargo loss or damage, other property damage, or serious personal injuries. As a result, claims may be asserted against us for actions by such drivers or for our actions in retaining them. We may also incur claims in connection with third-party vendors utilized in FleetNet\u2019s operations. Our third-party contract carriers and other vendors may not agree to bear responsibility for such claims or we may become responsible if they are unable to pay the claims, for example, due to bankruptcy proceedings, and such claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all.\nWe are subject to litigation risks that could result in significant expenditures and have other material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, competitive matters, personal injury, property damage, cargo claims, safety and contract compliance, environmental liability, and other matters. We are subject to risk and uncertainties related to liabilities which may result from the cost of defending against class-action litigation, such as alleged violations of anti-trust laws, wage-and-hour, and discrimination claims, and any other legal proceedings. Some or all of our expenditures to defend, settle, or litigate these matters may not be covered by insurance or could impact our cost and ability to obtain insurance in the future. Also, litigation can be disruptive to normal business operations and could require a substantial amount of time and effort by our management team. Any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our business reputation and our relationship with our customers, suppliers, and employees may also be adversely impacted by our involvement in legal proceedings. For more information related to the Company\u2019s legal proceedings, see Note O to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe establish reserves based on our assessment of legal matters and contingencies. Subsequent developments related to legal claims asserted against us may affect our assessment and estimates of our recorded legal reserves and may require\nus to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nClaims expenses or the cost of maintaining our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nClaims may be asserted against us for accidents or for cargo loss or damage, property damage, personal injury, and workers\u2019 compensation occurring in our operations. Claims may also be asserted against us for accidents involving the operations of third-party service providers that we utilize for our asset-light logistics segments, for our actions in retaining their services, or for loss or damage to our customers\u2019 goods for which we are determined to be responsible. Such claims against us may not be covered by insurance policies or may exceed the amount of insurance coverage, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. We have established liabilities which are adjusted to reflect our claims experience; however, actual claims costs and legal expenses may exceed our estimates. If the frequency and/or severity of claims increase, our operating results could be adversely affected. The timing of the incurrence of these costs could significantly and adversely impact our operating results. We are self-insured for workers\u2019 compensation, third-party casualty loss, and cargo loss or damage claims for the operations of ABF Freight and certain of our other subsidiaries. We also self-insure for medical benefits for our eligible nonunion personnel. Because we self-insure for a significant portion of our claims exposure and related expenses, our insurance and claims expense may be volatile. If we lose our ability to self-insure for any significant period of time, insurance costs could materially increase and we could experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage in that event. ABF Freight\u2019s self-insurance program for third-party casualty claims is conducted under a federal program administered by a government agency. If the government were to terminate the program or if ABF Freight were to be excluded from the program, our insurance costs could increase. Additionally, if our third-party insurance carriers or underwriters leave the trucking sector, it could materially increase our insurance costs or collateral requirements, or create difficulties in finding insurance in excess of our self-insured retention limits. We could also experience additional increases in our insurance premiums or deductibles in the future due to market conditions or if our claims experience worsens. If our insurance or claims expense increases, or if we decide to increase our insurance coverage in the future, and we are unable to offset any increase in expense with higher revenues, our earnings could be adversely affected. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nSignificant increases in health care costs related to medical inflation, claims experience, current and future federal and state laws and regulations, and other cost components that are beyond our control could significantly increase the costs of our self-insured medical plans and postretirement medical costs, or require us to adjust the level of benefits offered to our employees. In particular, with the passage in 2010 of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cPPACA\u201d), we are required to provide health care benefits to all full-time employees that meet certain minimum requirements of coverage and affordability, or otherwise be subject to a payment per employee based on the affordability criteria set forth in the PPACA. Many of these requirements have been phased in over time, with the majority of the most impactful provisions affecting us having begun in the second quarter of 2015. The PPACA also requires individuals to obtain coverage or face individual penalties, so employees who are currently eligible but have elected not to participate in our health care plans may ultimately find it more advantageous to do so. In general, implementing the requirements of health care reform is likely to impose additional administrative costs. The costs of maintaining and monitoring compliance and reports and other effects of these new healthcare requirements, including any failure to comply, may significantly increase our health care coverage costs and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have programs in place with multiple surety companies for the issuance of unsecured surety bonds in support of our self-insurance program for workers\u2019 compensation and third-party casualty. Estimates made by the states and the surety companies of our future exposure for our self-insurance liabilities could influence the amount and cost of additional letters of credit and surety bonds required to support our self-insurance program, and we may be required to maintain secured surety bonds in the future which could increase the amount of our cash equivalents and short-term investments restricted for use and unavailable for operational or capital requirements.\nWe depend heavily on the availability of fuel for our trucks. Fuel shortages, changes in fuel prices, and the inability to collect fuel surcharges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe transportation industry is dependent upon the availability of adequate fuel supplies. A disruption in our fuel supply resulting from natural or man-made disasters, armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, actions by producers, or other political,\neconomic, and market factors that are beyond our control could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at our distribution centers and certain other terminals; however, we may experience shortages in the availability of fuel at certain locations and may be forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules.\nFuel represents a significant operating expense for us, and we do not have any long-term fuel purchase contracts or any hedging arrangements to protect against fuel price increases. Fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to factors beyond our control, such as political events, price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels, terrorist activities, and hurricanes and other natural or man-made disasters, and fuel prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years. Significant increases in fuel prices or fuel taxes resulting from these or other economic or regulatory changes which are not offset by base freight rate increases or fuel surcharges could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur ABF Freight and Panther segments charge a fuel surcharge based on an index of national diesel fuel prices. Although revenues from fuel surcharges generally more than offset increases in direct diesel fuel costs, we incur certain fuel costs that cannot be recovered with fuel surcharges, and other operating costs have been, and may continue to be, impacted by fluctuating fuel prices. The total impact of energy prices on other nonfuel-related expenses is difficult to ascertain. We cannot predict, with reasonable certainty, future fuel price fluctuations, the impact of energy prices on other cost elements, recoverability of fuel costs through fuel surcharges, and the effect of fuel surcharges on our overall rate structure or the total price that we will receive from our customers. Whether fuel prices fluctuate or remain constant, operating results may be adversely affected if competitive pressures limit our ability to recover fuel surcharges. Throughout 2015, the fuel surcharge mechanism generally continued to have market acceptance among our customers; however, certain nonstandard pricing arrangements have limited the amount of fuel surcharge recovered. The negative impact on operating margins of capped fuel surcharge revenue during periods of increasing fuel costs is more evident when fuel prices remain above the maximum levels recovered through the fuel surcharge mechanism on certain accounts. Also, because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices, our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture in any particular period the increased costs we pay for fuel, especially in periods in which fuel prices rapidly increase. In periods of declining fuel prices, which we have experienced since third quarter 2014, our fuel surcharge percentages also decrease, which negatively impacts our revenues, and the revenue decline may be disproportionate to our fuel costs. While the fuel surcharge is one of several components in our overall rate structure, the actual rate paid by customers is governed by market forces and the overall value of services provided to the customer. When fuel surcharges constitute a higher proportion of the total freight rate paid, our customers are less receptive to increases in base freight rates. Prolonged periods of inadequate base rate improvements could adversely impact operating results as elements of costs, including contractual wage rates, continue to increase. Further, during periods of low freight volumes, shippers can use their negotiating leverage to impose less compensatory fuel surcharge policies.\nHigher fuel prices cause customers of our FleetNet segment to seek cost savings throughout their businesses which may result in a reduction of miles driven and/or a deferral of maintenance practices that may reduce the volume of our maintenance service events, resulting in an adverse impact on the segment\u2019s operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nIncreased prices for, or decreases in the availability of, new revenue equipment and decreases in the value of used revenue equipment, as well as higher costs of equipment-related operating expenses, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nIn recent years, manufacturers have raised the prices of new revenue equipment significantly due to increased costs of materials and, in part, to offset their costs of compliance with new tractor engine and emissions system design requirements intended to reduce emissions, which have been mandated by the EPA, the NHTSA, and various state agencies such as those described in \u201cEnvironmental and Other Government Regulations\u201d of the Freight Transportation (ABF Freight) Segment section of \u201cBusiness\u201d in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Greenhouse gas emissions regulations are likely to continue to impact the design and cost of equipment utilized in our operations. A number of states have mandated, and California and certain other states may continue to individually mandate, additional emission-control requirements for equipment which could increase equipment costs for entire fleets that operate in interstate commerce. If new equipment prices increase more than anticipated, we could incur higher depreciation and rental expenses than anticipated. Our third-party capacity providers, including Panther\u2019s owner operators, are also subject to increased regulations and higher equipment prices which will, in turn, increase our costs for utilizing their services or may cause certain providers to exit the industry which could lead to a capacity shortage and further increase our costs of securing third-party services. If we\nare unable to fully offset any such increases in expenses with freight rate increases and/or improved fuel economy, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nReduced fuel demand due to improved fuel economy may result in legislative efforts to increase fuel taxes which, if enacted, could significantly increase our costs. If we are not able to adequately increase our freight rates, recover fuel surcharges, or recognize fuel economy savings to offset increases in equipment and maintenance costs, and if we are not able to offset fuel tax increases through reductions in other excise taxes or through increases in the rates we charge our customers, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply. From time to time, some original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d) of tractors and trailers may reduce their manufacturing output due to, for example, lower demand for their products in economic downturns or a shortage of component parts. Component suppliers may either reduce production or be unable to increase production to meet OEM demand, creating periodic difficulty for OEMs to react in a timely manner to increased demand for new equipment and/or increased demand for replacement components as economic conditions change. At times, market forces may create market situations in which demand outstrips supply. In those situations, we may face reduced supply levels and/or increased acquisition costs. An inability to continue to obtain an adequate supply of new tractors or trailers for our ABF Freight operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nDuring prolonged periods of decreased tonnage levels, we and other trucking companies may make strategic fleet reductions, which could result in an increase in the supply of used equipment. When the supply exceeds the demand for used revenue equipment, the general market value of used revenue equipment decreases. Used equipment prices are also subject to substantial fluctuations based on availability of financing and commodity prices for scrap metal. If market prices for used revenue equipment decline, corresponding decreases in our established salvage values on equipment being used in our ABF Freight operations would increase our depreciation expense, and we could incur impairment losses on assets held for sale which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur management team is an important part of our business and loss of key employees could impair our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe benefit from the leadership and experience of our senior management team and other key employees and depend on their continued services to successfully implement our business strategy. The unexpected loss of key employees or inability to execute our succession planning strategies could have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability if we are unable to secure replacement personnel that have sufficient experience in our industry and in the management of our business.\nIf we are unable to maintain our corporate reputation and the ABF, Panther, U-Pack and other brands and related intellectual property, our business may suffer. The costs and resources expended to enforce or protect our trademarks or other intellectual property could adversely impact our results of operations.\nABF Freight is recognized as an industry leader for its commitment to quality, customer service, safety, and technology. Our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the image of the ABF brand as it applies to both ABF Freight and ABF Logistics. The Panther brand is also synonymous with premium service. Service, performance, and safety issues, whether actual or perceived and whether as a result of our actions or those of our third-party contract carriers and their drivers and owner operators, could adversely impact our customers\u2019 image of the ABF companies, Panther, and U-Pack and result in the loss of business or impede our growth initiatives. Adverse publicity regarding labor relations, legal matters, environmental concerns, and similar matters, which are connected to ABF Freight, whether or not justified, could have a negative impact on our reputation and may result in the loss of customers and our inability to secure new customer relationships, as well as hinder the growth of our asset-light logistics businesses. Our business and our image could also be negatively impacted by a breach of our corporate policies by employees or vendors. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.\nWe have registered \u201cArcBest Corporation,\u201d \u201cABF,\u201d \u201cFleetNet America,\u201d \u201cPanther,\u201d and \u201cU-Pack\u201d and various related marks or designs, such as \u201cThe Skill & The Will\u201d and \u201cU-Pack We Drive. You Save.\u201d as trademarks in the United States and, for some marks, we have registered or are pursuing registration in certain other countries. At times, competitors may adopt service names similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market\nconfusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered trademarks. From time to time, we have acquired or attempted to acquire Internet domain names held by others when such names have caused consumer confusion or had the potential to cause consumer confusion. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights or other intellectual property may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur initiatives to grow our business operations or to manage our cost structure to business levels may take longer than anticipated or may not be successful.\nDeveloping service offerings requires ongoing investment in personnel and infrastructure, including operating and management information systems. Depending upon the timing and level of revenues generated from our growth initiatives, the related results of operations and cash flows we anticipate from these initiatives and additional service offerings may not be achieved. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur growth plans place significant demands on our management and operating personnel and we may not be able to hire, train, and retain the appropriate personnel to manage and grow these services. In addition, as we focus on growing our asset-light logistics businesses, we may encounter difficulties in adapting our corporate structure or in developing and maintaining effective partnerships among our operating segments which could hinder our operational, financial, and strategic objectives. Furthermore, we may invest significant resources to enter or expand our services in markets with established competitors, and we may not be able to successfully gain market share which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe also face challenges and risks in implementing initiatives to manage our cost structure to business levels. We periodically evaluate and modify the ABF Freight network to reflect changes in customer demands and to reconcile ABF Freight\u2019s infrastructure with tonnage levels and the proximity of customer freight, and there can be no assurance that these network changes, to the extent such network changes are made, will result in a material improvement of ABF Freight\u2019s results of operations.\nOur Credit Facility and accounts receivable securitization program contain customary financial and other customary restrictive covenants that may limit our future operations. A default under these financing arrangements or changes in regulations which impact the availability of funds or our costs to borrow under our financing arrangements could cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which governs our Credit Facility, contains representations and warranties, conditions, and events of default that are customary for financings of this type including, but not limited to, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a maximum adjusted leverage ratio, and limitations on incurrence of debt, investments, liens on assets, certain sale and leaseback transactions, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, and sales of assets. Our accounts receivable securitization program also contains affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default that are customary for financings of this type, including a maximum adjusted leverage ratio and requirements to maintain certain characteristics of the receivables, such as rates of delinquency, default, and dilution.\nIf we default under the terms of our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or our accounts receivable securitization program and fail to obtain appropriate amendments to or waivers under the applicable financing arrangement, our borrowings under such facilities could be immediately declared due and payable. In the event of a default under either of these facilities, we could automatically default on the other of these facilities and on our outstanding notes payable and other financing agreements, unless the lenders to these facilities choose not to exercise remedies or to otherwise allow us to cure the default. If we fail to pay the amount due under our Credit Facility or accounts payable securitization program, the lenders could proceed against the collateral by which our Credit Facility is secured, our borrowing capacity may be limited, or the facilities could be terminated. If acceleration of outstanding borrowings occurs or if the facilities are terminated, we may have difficulty borrowing additional funds sufficient to refinance the accelerated debt or entering into new credit or debt arrangements, and, if available, the terms of the financing may not be acceptable. A default under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or accounts receivable securitization program or changes in regulations which\nimpact the availability of funds or our costs to borrow under our financing arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nIn addition, failing to achieve certain financial ratios as required by our Credit Facility and accounts receivable securitization program could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions or investments, or plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.\nWe have significant ongoing capital requirements that could have a material adverse effect on our business, profitability, and growth if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms or properly forecast capital needs to correspond with business volumes.\nWe have significant ongoing capital requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash from operations in the future, our growth could be limited; it may be necessary for us to utilize our existing financing arrangements to a greater extent or enter into additional leasing or financing arrangements, possibly on less favorable terms; or our revenue equipment may have to be held for longer periods, which would result in increased expenditures for maintenance. Forecasting business volumes involves many factors, including general economic trends and the impact of competition, which are subject to uncertainty and beyond our control. If we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs, especially for revenue equipment, in relation to corresponding business levels, we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity. In addition, our Credit Facility contains provisions that could limit our level of annual capital expenditures. If we were unable to properly forecast capital needs and/or were unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, obtain adequate financing at acceptable terms, or if our capital spending was otherwise limited, there could be an adverse effect on our business, profitability, and growth.\nOur results of operations could be impacted by seasonal fluctuations or adverse weather conditions.\nOur operations are impacted by seasonal fluctuations which affect tonnage and shipment levels and, consequently, revenues and operating results. Freight shipments and operating costs of the ABF Freight and ABF Logistics operating segments can be adversely affected by inclement weather conditions. The first quarter of each year generally has the lowest tonnage levels; at the same time, operating expenses may increase due to, among other things, a decline in fuel economy because of higher fuel density in colder temperatures, and higher accident frequency, increased claims, and potentially higher equipment repair expenditures caused by harsh weather. Expedited shipments of the Panther segment may decline due to post-holiday slowdowns during winter months and plant shutdowns during summer months. Emergency roadside service events of the FleetNet segment are influenced by seasonal variations, and service event volume is generally lower during mild weather conditions. Business levels of the ABF Moving segment are generally lower in the non-summer months when demand for moving services is typically lower. In addition to the impact of weather on seasonal business trends, severe weather events and natural disasters, such as harsh winter weather, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, or lightning strikes, could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers or disrupt fuel supplies or increase fuel costs, each of which could adversely affect our business levels and operating results. Climate change may have an influence on the severity of weather conditions, which could adversely affect our freight shipments and level of services provided by our asset-light logistics segments and, consequently, our operating results.\nWe are subject to certain risks arising from our international business.\nWe provide transportation and logistics services to and from international locations and are, therefore, subject to risks of international business, including, but not limited to, changes in the economic strength of certain foreign countries; social, political, and economic instability; the ability to secure space on third-party aircraft, ocean vessels, and other modes of transportation; burdens of complying with a wide variety of international and United States regulations and export and import laws as well as different liability standards and less developed legal systems; difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights; changes in foreign exchange rates; and restrictive trade policies and imposition of duties, taxes, or government royalties imposed by foreign governments, and changes in international tax laws and regulations. In addition, natural disasters, pandemics, acts of terrorism, and insurrections could impede our ability to provide satisfactory services to customers in international locations.\nWe are also subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and hold Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (\u201cC-TPAT\u2019) status for businesses within our ABF Freight, Panther, and ABF Logistics segments. Failure to comply with the FCPA and local regulations in the conduct of our international business operations may result in criminal and civil penalties against us. If we are unable to maintain our C-TPAT status, we may face a loss of certain\nbusiness due to customer requirements to deal only with C-TPAT participating carriers, because of the enhanced levels of supply chain security provided by participating in the C-TPAT program. In addition, loss of C-TPAT status for Panther may result in significant border delays for the segment, which could cause its international operations to be less efficient than competitors also operating internationally.\nOur business could be harmed by antiterrorism measures.\nAs a result of actual or threatened terrorist attacks on the United States, federal, state, and municipal authorities have implemented and may implement in the future various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. Although many companies would be adversely affected by any slowdown in the availability of freight transportation, the negative impact could affect our business disproportionately. For example, we offer specialized services that guarantee on-time delivery. If security measures disrupt the timing of deliveries, we could fail to meet the needs of our customers or could incur increased costs in order to do so. Additional security measures may also reduce productivity of our drivers and third-party transportation service providers, which would increase our operating costs. There can be no assurance that new antiterrorism measures will not be implemented and that such new measures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.", "PERMNO": 77595, "SIC": 4213, "TIC": "ARCB"}
