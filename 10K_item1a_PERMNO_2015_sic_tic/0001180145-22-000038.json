Risk Factors.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Operations\nOutbreaks of contagious diseases, such as the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, and other public health crises may impact our business and operations, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have experienced a disruption in procedures using our products and in our operations as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States and internationally. Public health crises, including an outbreak of a contagious disease, such as COVID-19, particularly to the extent it becomes a pandemic like COVID-19, could significantly disrupt our business. The effects of such a public health crisis may include a decrease in procedure volumes due to restrictions and guidelines implemented by facilities and governmental entities; reduced availability of physicians or lab space to treat patients using our products and/or different treatment prioritizations of those physicians; increased cost pressures and burdens on the overall healthcare infrastructure that result in reallocation of resources; changed treatment decisions by patients who may elect to defer or avoid treatment for procedures that use our products due to concerns about the potential spread of diseases in facilities; the suspension of clinical trial activity; restrictions on the ability of our personnel and personnel of our distribution partners and sales agents to travel and to access customers and medical facilities for sales activities, training and case support; delays in approvals by regulatory bodies; delays in product development efforts, which will also disrupt or delay our ability to launch affected products; reallocation of company resources from our strategic priorities; supply chain disruptions that limit, delay or prevent us from acquiring the components used to manufacture our products or ship those products once manufactured; disruptions in our relationships with our distributors and sales agents due to the impact of the outbreak on their operations; temporary closures of our facilities; loss of employee productivity; government requirements to \u201cshelter at home\u201d or other incremental mitigation efforts that may further impact our capacity to manufacture, sell and support the use of our products; legal actions threatened or commenced against us by employees, customers or others who allege that our actions or inactions relating to safety measures led to their exposure to COVID-19 or other personal injury; and adverse impacts on the national and global economies. The extent of the COVID-19 pandemic may be further aggravated by the spread of new, more viral or deadly variants. Public health crises and pandemics, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, also affect the economy generally, which may affect our stock price, our ability to borrow or raise additional capital, and the funding of health systems that purchase our products, among other potential effects. The United States and world economies could enter into periods of sustained recession or depression, which could materially adversely affect our business. The total impact of these disruptions could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations, and, we cannot predict the specific extent, or duration, of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak or any other outbreak of a contagious disease or other public health crisis on our financial condition and results. Furthermore, the global COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and we do not yet know the full extent and duration of its impact. The full extent to which a public health crisis will directly or indirectly impact our business and results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. Finally, to the extent a public health crisis adversely affects our business, results and prospects, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this section.\nWe have a history of net losses, and may continue to incur losses.\nWe were profitable in fiscal 2018 but have incurred net losses in each prior fiscal year since our formation in 1989 and most recently in fiscal 2020, 2021 and 2022. For the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we had net losses of $(36.9) million, $(13.4) million, and $(27.2) million, respectively. As of June 30, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $423.7 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses for sales and marketing, research and development (including clinical trial activity), and manufacturing as we expand our product offering, launch our business in international markets, continue to commercialize the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS and develop and commercialize future versions of the Peripheral OAS, the Coronary OAS, and future products. Additionally, we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase to support business growth. If we are unable to balance revenue growth and cost management, our operating losses may continue.\nWe may be unable to achieve or sustain revenue growth.\nOur business is substantially dependent upon sales of the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS. Our ability to increase our revenues in future periods will depend on our ability to increase sales of the OAS and other products we introduce in the future, which will, in turn, depend in part on our success in growing our customer base and reorders from those customers. Sales of the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS declined in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 and there is no assurance that sales will return to previous levels. We may not be able to generate, sustain or increase revenues on a quarterly or annual basis. If we cannot achieve or sustain revenue growth for an extended period, our financial results will be adversely affected and our stock price may decline.\nThe Peripheral OAS, the Coronary OAS, and other products may never achieve broad market acceptance.\nThe Peripheral OAS, the Coronary OAS, and other products we develop or market now or in the future may never gain broad market acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of any of our products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the actual and perceived effectiveness and reliability of our products;\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of any adverse patient events involving our products;\n\u2022the results of any clinical trials relating to use of our products;\n\u2022the availability, relative cost and perceived advantages and disadvantages of alternative technologies or treatment methods for conditions treated by our products;\n\u2022the degree to which treatments using our products are approved for reimbursement by public and private insurers;\n\u2022the degree to which physicians adopt our products;\n\u2022the extent to which we are successful in educating physicians about PAD and CAD in general and the existence and benefits of our products in particular;\n\u2022the strength of our marketing and distribution infrastructure;\n\u2022the level of education and awareness among physicians and hospitals concerning our products; and\n\u2022our reputation among physicians and hospitals.\nFailure of our products to significantly penetrate current or new markets would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur customers may not be able to achieve adequate reimbursement for using the Peripheral OAS, the Coronary OAS or other products, which could affect the acceptance of our products and cause our business to suffer.\nThe availability of insurance coverage and reimbursement for newly approved medical devices and procedures is uncertain. The commercial success of our products is substantially dependent on whether third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement for the use of such products and related services are available. We expect our products to continue to be purchased by hospitals and other providers who will then seek reimbursement from various public and private third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers, for the services provided to patients. While third-party payors are currently providing reimbursement for our products, we can give no assurance that these third-party payors will continue to provide adequate reimbursement for use of the Peripheral OAS, the Coronary OAS and our other products to permit hospitals and doctors to consider the products cost-effective for patients requiring treatment, or that current reimbursement levels for our products will continue. In addition, the overall amount of reimbursement available for PAD and CAD treatment could decrease in the future. For example, the reimbursement available for the use of certain of our products in certain settings, such as office-based labs, has been reduced and is proposed to be reduced further. In addition, we expect that the American Medical Association CPT lower extremity revascularization codes will be subject to a review process, which could also result in a decrease in the reimbursement available for the use of certain of our products. Failure by hospitals and other users of our products to obtain sufficient reimbursement could cause our business to suffer.\nMedicare, Medicaid, health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement, and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for use of our products. If the national or world economies suffer a prolonged recession or depression, the pressures on these payors to contain costs will be exacerbated. In order to position our products for acceptance by third-party payors, we may have to agree to lower prices than we might otherwise charge.\nGovernmental and private sector payors have instituted initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs using, for example, price regulation or controls and competitive pricing programs. Some third-party payors also require demonstrated superiority, on the basis of randomized clinical trials, or pre-approval of coverage, for new or innovative devices or procedures before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such devices or procedures. It is uncertain whether our current products or any future products we may develop will be viewed as sufficiently cost-effective to warrant adequate coverage and reimbursement levels.\nIn addition, in the event of future allegations of our violations of healthcare laws, we could be excluded from participation in federal health care programs. If third-party coverage and reimbursement for our products is limited or not available, the acceptance of our products and, consequently, our business will be substantially harmed.\nWe have limited data and experience regarding the safety and efficacy of the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS. Any long-term data that is generated may not be positive or consistent with our limited short-term data, which would affect market acceptance of these products.\nBecause our technology is relatively new in the treatment of PAD and CAD, we have performed clinical trials only with limited patient populations. The long-term effects of using the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS in a large number of patients have not been studied and the results of short-term clinical use of the Peripheral OAS or the Coronary OAS do not necessarily predict long-term clinical benefits or reveal long-term adverse effects. We are conducting and developing several clinical trials, and there are substantial risks and uncertainties involved in these trials. We must devote substantial resources to our clinical trials, clinical trials often take several years to develop and conduct, there are difficulties involved in locating sites and patients to participate in our clinical trials, and the results of every trial are uncertain until the trial is completed. Furthermore, our active and future clinical trials may take substantially longer than we anticipate to develop, enroll, conduct and complete. These uncertainties could adversely impact our financial results, our reputation and the reputation of our products. For example, enrollment in ECLIPSE was paused from March to October 2020 due to COVID-19, which will delay the completion of the trial and the publication of its results.\nClinical trials conducted with the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS have involved procedures performed by physicians who are very technically proficient. Consequently, both short and long-term results reported in these studies may be significantly more favorable than typical results achieved by physicians, which could negatively impact market acceptance of the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS and materially harm our business.\nWe face significant competition, must innovate to stay competitive, and may be unable to sell the Peripheral OAS, the Coronary OAS or any other products at profitable levels.\nThe market for medical devices is highly competitive, dynamic and marked by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovation. Our ability to compete depends on our ability to innovate successfully, and, while certain barriers exist to entry into our market, we cannot assure that new entrants or existing competitors will not be able to develop products that compete directly with our products. We compete against very large and well-known stent and balloon angioplasty device manufacturers, atherectomy catheter manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, companies that provide products used by surgeons in peripheral and coronary bypass procedures, and other companies that develop and sell other products or devices for the treatment of vascular disease. We may have difficulty competing effectively with these competitors because of their well-established positions in the marketplace, significant financial and human capital resources, established reputations, worldwide distribution channels, and the novelty and effectiveness of their products.\nOur competitors may:\n\u2022develop and patent processes or products earlier than we will;\n\u2022obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for competing medical device products more rapidly than we will;\n\u2022market their products more effectively than we will;\n\u2022sell their products at lower prices than we do; or\n\u2022develop more effective or less expensive products or technologies that render our technology or products obsolete or non-competitive.\nWe have encountered and expect to continue to encounter potential customers who, due to existing relationships with our competitors, are committed to or prefer the products offered by these competitors. In addition, increased consolidation in the healthcare industry has resulted in companies with greater market power, which increases competition for goods and services.\nWe experience significant competition on the pricing of our products and expect to continue to experience pressure from our customers to lower our prices. Our customers may require lower pricing in connection with contract renewals or otherwise for us to continue to sell our products to them. In addition, if our purchasing agreement with HealthTrust Purchasing Group, L.P. is terminated, our financial results will be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully, our revenue will suffer. Increased competition might lead to price reductions and other concessions that might adversely affect our operating results. Competitive pressures may decrease the demand for our products and could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur efforts to develop new products may not be successful or the new products may not provide the revenue we expect.\nWe have been and are substantially dependent on the sales of the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS and seek to diversify our product portfolio, particularly as sales of the Peripheral OAS and Coronary OAS declined in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. We plan to add to our product portfolio through both internal development efforts and through acquisitions, distribution agreements, licensing transactions, manufacturing agreements, joint ventures, collaboration and development agreements, and other strategic partnerships. We have several products in development, and we have also entered into distribution agreements for the sale of OrbusNeich products by us in the United States and the sale of our products in Japan by Medikit and in the rest of the world by a network of distributors and sales agents. New products may also include updated and improved versions of our existing products and of existing OrbusNeich products that we sell.\nThese new products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, clinical trial requirements and results, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to develop and manufacture, failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Development of new products may take substantially longer than we anticipate, or we may decide to cease development of a product. We have experienced delays in the development of our new percutaneous ventricular assist device and other products, and we have ceased or paused the development of certain other products. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors caused delays in our product development and product launch efforts, which has caused and will cause delays in our ability to launch the affected products, if we are able to complete their development and launch them at all. Many of the new products in development will require clinical trials, which will require us to incur substantial additional costs. Even if we successfully develop or introduce new products or enhancements or new generations of our existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors\u2019 innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. We cannot provide certainty as to when or whether any of our products under development will be launched, whether we will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or technologies, or new indications or uses for existing products, may cause our products or technologies to become obsolete, causing our revenues and operating results to suffer. In addition our distribution agreement for the sale of our products in Japan by Medikit expires in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. If we are unable to renew this agreement on terms acceptable to us or at all, or if we are unable to secure an alternative distributor in Japan in the event of non-renewal, our financial results will be adversely affected.\nGrowth in the office-based lab site of service for PAD procedures could adversely affect our business.\nWe have observed a shift in the number of PAD procedures that are performed in office-based labs (\u201cOBLs\u201d) in the United States as compared to PAD procedures performed in hospitals. These OBLs tend to have more price sensitivity than hospitals, as they are often established and managed by individual physicians and are subject to different reimbursement payments than hospitals. This price sensitivity has been, and may continue to be, heightened during periods of economic uncertainty, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and social unrest that began in the United States in 2020. As a result, our sales to OBLs have resulted, and could continue to result, in lower pricing. To the extent that the OBL site of service continues to grow, we may experience increasing pricing pressure and be forced to lower our prices further in order to retain existing business and gain new business with OBL customers. We may not be able to increase the volumes of our products sold overall in order to offset any pricing pressure we experience in sales to OBLs, which would result in our revenues declining or not growing as fast as we anticipate, which would adversely affect our business.\nWe have limited commercial manufacturing experience and could experience difficulty in producing the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS and other products or may need to depend on third parties to manufacture the products.\nWe have limited experience in commercially manufacturing the Peripheral OAS, even less experience in commercially manufacturing the Coronary OAS and no experience manufacturing these products in the quantities that we anticipate will be required if we achieve planned levels of commercial sales. As a result, we may not be able to develop and implement efficient, low-cost manufacturing capabilities and processes that will enable us to manufacture the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS or future products in significant volumes, while meeting the legal, regulatory, quality, price, durability, engineering, design and production standards required to market our products successfully.\nThe forecasts of demand we use to determine order quantities and lead times for components purchased from outside suppliers may be incorrect. Our failure to obtain required components or subassemblies when needed and at a reasonable cost would adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, we may in the future need to depend upon third parties to manufacture the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS and future products. Any difficulties in locating and hiring third-party manufacturers, or in the ability of third-party manufacturers to supply quantities of our products at the times and in the quantities we need, could have a material adverse\neffect on our business.\nWe depend upon third-party suppliers, including single source suppliers to us and our customers, making us vulnerable to supply problems and price fluctuations.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers to provide us with certain components of our products and to provide key components or supplies to our customers for use with our products and to sterilize our products prior to final packaging. We rely on single source suppliers for certain components of the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS, including the diamond-grit-coated crown, and for our ViperSlide Lubricant. In some cases, we do not have long-term supply agreements with, or guaranteed commitments from, our suppliers, including single source suppliers. Although we have entered into long-term supply agreements with Fresenius Kabi AB for the supply of ViperSlide and with Abrasive Technology, Inc. for the supply of the diamond-grit-coated crowns, there can be no assurance that these agreements will guarantee uninterrupted supply or that we will be able to renew these agreements on favorable terms, or at all. We depend on our suppliers to provide us and our customers with materials in a timely manner that meet our and their quality, quantity and cost requirements. These suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing and sterilization for a variety of reasons, any of which could delay or impede their ability to meet our demand and our customers\u2019 demands. These suppliers may cease producing the components we purchase from them or otherwise decide to cease doing business with us.\nCompanies in the United States and around the world have experienced a disruption in the supply of certain components and raw materials, such as electronics, resins and polymers, which may adversely affect us and our ability to obtain these components in a timely manner, in the volumes we require, or at all. In addition, the prices of these components and other supplies we rely upon in the manufacture of our products may rise. For example, we and our suppliers have recently experienced, and may continue to experience, rising costs due to inflation, such as costs of materials, labor and freight. If inflation continues to rise, the prices of our components may rise, resulting in increased expenses to us that we may not be able to offset by raising the prices of our products.\nAny supply interruption from our suppliers or failure to obtain additional suppliers for any of the components used in our products or in the sterilization of our products, or price increases of these supplies, would limit our ability to manufacture our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, our customers may be adversely affected by shortages of goods and supplies used in the procedures they perform using our products, as well as labor shortages. For example, we are aware that some of our customers have experienced shortages of contrast dye, which is used in the procedures involving our products, and labor shortages, and those shortages limited their ability to perform procedures. If our customers are not able to acquire the supplies they need to adequately perform procedures and maintain adequate staffing levels, then they may decrease the use of our products, which would adversely affect our financial results.\nWe intend to continue to sell our products internationally in the future, but we may experience difficulties in obtaining or maintaining approval to do so or in successfully marketing our products internationally even if approved.\nCurrently, substantially all of our revenues are in the United States. In fiscal 2018, commercial sales of certain of our products commenced in Japan, which became the first international market for our products, and in fiscal 2019, we commenced sales in certain countries in Southeast Asia, Europe and the Middle East under our distribution agreement with OrbusNeich. We have continued to expand sales of our products into additional countries through fiscal 2022 and intend to continue this expansion. Our ability to sell our products outside of the United States is and will continue to be subject to foreign regulatory requirements, and we may incur substantial time and expense in seeking these approvals. Although our products have been cleared or approved by the FDA, regulatory authorities in other countries may not approve the same products for sale in their countries. Attempting to obtain these foreign approvals could result in significant delays and expenses for us and require additional clinical trials. We will be subject to substantial requirements relating to our international expansion, including differing regulatory, import, marketing and distribution requirements and different levels and structures of reimbursement and payment. There can be no guarantee that we will receive approval to sell our products in any additional countries or that any of our approvals will be maintained, nor can there be any guarantee that any sales would result even if such approval is received. We will be substantially reliant upon Medikit and other international distribution and sales agent partners for our international sales, and any failure of such distributors and sales agents to effectively sell our products could have a material adverse effect on our international efforts and harm our financial position. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the international markets and the ability of our distributors to grow the markets for our products in other countries. Travel restrictions and our inability to support new accounts has negatively impacted our progress in international markets. In addition, we will incur substantial expenses in connection with international expansion, particularly with respect to our efforts to train physicians on the safe and effective use of our products. Our inability to successfully enter international markets and manage business on a global scale could negatively affect our financial results. In addition, our distribution agreement for the sale of our products in Japan by Medikit expires in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. If we are unable to renew this agreement on terms acceptable to us or at all, or if we are unable to secure an alternative distributor in Japan in the event of non-renewal, our financial results will be\nadversely affected.\nWe are dependent on our senior management team and highly skilled personnel, and our business could be harmed if we are unable to attract and retain personnel necessary for our success.\nWe are highly dependent on our senior management, particularly Scott Ward, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and other key personnel. We experienced an increase in employee turnover in fiscal 2022, including several positions at the senior management level. Our success will depend on our ability to retain senior management and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future, including sales and marketing professionals, scientists, clinical specialists, engineers and other highly skilled personnel and to integrate current and additional personnel in all departments. The loss of members of our senior management, sales and marketing professionals, scientists, clinical and regulatory specialists and engineers could prevent us from achieving our objectives of continuing to grow our company. We do not carry key person life insurance on any of our employees.\nWe may need to increase the size of our organization in the future, and we may experience difficulties managing growth. If we are unable to manage the anticipated growth of our business, our future revenue and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe may need to expand the size of our organization in the future. The growth we may experience in the future may provide challenges to our organization, requiring us to also rapidly expand other aspects of our business, including our manufacturing operations. Rapid expansion in personnel may result in less experienced people producing and selling our products, which could result in unanticipated costs and disruptions to our operations. If we cannot scale and manage our business appropriately, our anticipated growth may be impaired and our financial results will suffer.\nWe may require additional financing, and our failure to obtain additional financing when needed could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe anticipate the need for additional financing in the future in order to execute our long-term strategic business plan. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. In the event we need or desire additional financing, we may be unable to obtain it by borrowing money in the credit markets or raising money in the capital markets. If adequate funds are not available on a timely basis, we may need to terminate or delay the development of one or more of our products, or delay establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities necessary to commercialize our products.\nWe face a risk of non-compliance with the financial covenants in our loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank.\nWe are party to a loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank. This agreement requires us to maintain, among other things, either (i) minimum unrestricted cash at Silicon Valley Bank and unused availability on our line of credit of at least $10.0 million or (ii) minimum trailing three-month Adjusted EBITDA of $1.0 million and contains customary events of default, including, among others, the failure to comply with certain covenants or other agreements. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default, amounts due under the agreements may be accelerated by Silicon Valley Bank. If we are unable to meet the financial or other covenants under the current loan and security agreement or negotiate future waivers or amendments of such covenants, events of default could occur under the agreement. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the agreement, Silicon Valley Bank has available a range of remedies customary in these circumstances, including declaring all outstanding debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, to be due and payable, foreclosing on the assets securing the agreement and/or ceasing to provide additional loans under our line of credit, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe restrictive covenants under this agreement could limit our ability to obtain future financing, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. The financial and restrictive covenants contained in this agreement could also adversely affect our ability to respond to changing economic and business conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies that may be subject to fewer restrictions. Transactions that we may view as important opportunities, such as acquisitions, may be subject to the consent of Silicon Valley Bank, which consent may be withheld or granted subject to conditions specified at the time that may affect the attractiveness or viability of the transaction.\nWe lease our corporate headquarters and Texas manufacturing facility, which subjects us to ongoing payment obligations and compliance with certain covenants.\nOn March 30, 2017, we completed the sale of our corporate headquarters. In connection with such sale, we entered into a lease agreement for our corporate headquarters, which has an initial term of fifteen years, with four consecutive renewal options of\nfive years each. Under this lease, we are obligated to pay a base annual rent in the first year of $1.6 million with annual escalations of 3%. In fiscal 2021, we renewed the lease for our manufacturing facility in Pearland, Texas for an additional five years. If we are unable to make required rent payments or comply with the other covenants contained in the leases, the respective landlords could take certain actions against us, up to and including termination of the lease, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial conditions.\nOur stock price is volatile and subject to significant fluctuations.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations. Market prices for securities of early-stage pharmaceutical, medical device, biotechnology and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile. Our common stock traded as low as $13.41 and as high as $43.37 per share during the 12-month period ended June 30, 2022. Factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022announcements of technological or medical innovations for the treatment of vascular disease;\n\u2022quarterly variations in our or our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u2022failure to meet estimates or recommendations by securities analysts who cover our stock;\n\u2022failure to meet our own financial estimates;\n\u2022accusations that we have violated a law or regulation;\n\u2022recalls of our products;\n\u2022significant litigation;\n\u2022sales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers or directors;\n\u2022changes in accounting principles;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in healthcare policy and reimbursement levels;\n\u2022developments relating to our competitors and markets;\n\u2022new issuances of our common or preferred stock;\n\u2022pandemic developments or social unrest in the markets in which we operate; and\n\u2022general market conditions and other factors, such as a recession or depression or other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.\nMoreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We may have experienced an ownership change in the past and we may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future transactions in our stock, some of which may be outside our control. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards or other pre-change tax attributes to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income or taxes may be subject to limitations.\nAn interruption in or breach of security of our information or manufacturing systems could cause a loss of business or damage to our reputation.\nWe rely on information and communication systems in our manufacturing and in the conduct of our business. If there is any failure or interruption of these systems, such an incident could cause failures or disruptions in our customer relationship systems or product manufacturing. In addition, we could be subject to a cyber incident, such as an intentional attack or an unintentional event that involves a third party gaining unauthorized access to our systems or to the systems of business partners of ours who hold or have access to information regarding us, such as our suppliers and vendors, or a third party gaining access to software programs developed by third parties, any of which could disrupt our operations, corrupt our data, or result in release of our confidential information. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience actual or attempted cyber-attacks of our systems or networks. To date, none of these actual or attempted attacks has had a material effect on our operations or financial condition. Although we have systems and processes designed to detect and prevent security breaches, the technology used by parties seeking unauthorized access to our systems is rapidly changing and we are not fully insulated from technology disruptions that could adversely impact us and we may not be able to timely and adequately detect and prevent any breaches. While we devote significant resources to network security, data encryption and other security measures to protect our systems and data, including our own proprietary information and the confidential information of third parties, these measures cannot\nprovide absolute security. The costs to eliminate or alleviate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful, resulting potentially in the theft, loss, destruction or corruption of information we store electronically, as well as unexpected interruptions, delays or cessation of service, any of which could cause harm to our business operations. Moreover, if a computer security breach or cyber-attack affects our systems or the systems of any of our business partners results in the unauthorized release of proprietary or personally identifiable information, our reputation could be materially damaged, customer confidence in us could be diminished, and our operations could be impaired. We would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability, as well as government enforcement actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented remote work arrangements for most employees, and we expect many of our employees to continue to work remotely, and those employees may use outside technology and systems that are more vulnerable to security breaches, service interruptions, data loss or malicious attacks than our internal systems. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or cyber incidents could cause a loss of business or damage to our reputation and have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe effects of hurricanes, flooding and other natural disasters and other external events may impact our sales, inventories and supply availability, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn prior years, hurricanes have made landfall along the Texas Gulf Coast and in the State of Florida, respectively, bringing high winds, unprecedented rain and extreme flooding to those areas. A significant portion of our sales is generated from these areas. Procedure volumes in the Houston area and in Florida decreased during the pendency and immediate aftermath of prior hurricanes and flooding, which decreased the number of our products used during this time. Any sustained decrease in procedure volumes from hurricanes and other natural disasters, and other external events, such as political unrest, acts of war or terrorism, that affect any areas in which our customers are located will result in decreased sales in these areas and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we maintain a 46,000-square foot production facility in Pearland, Texas, which is just outside of Houston in southeast Texas. The storms referenced above and their aftermath did not cause damage to our Pearland facility. However, this facility suffered power loss and disruption of operations during the winter of 2021 due to severe storms in Texas. Any future loss of operations at the Pearland facility as a result of natural disasters and other external events eliminates an alternate production source in the event that our manufacturing capacity at the Minnesota facility is disrupted for any reason.\nWe also rely on third parties to manufacture certain of our products and components of our products, some of which are located outside of the United States. Any disruptions to their ability to manufacture these products or components as a result of hurricanes, flooding and other natural disasters and other external events, such as political unrest, acts of war or terrorism, could have a material effect on our ability to manufacture and supply our products.\nAny disruptions in our ability and the ability of third parties to timely manufacture and supply our products to our customers could cause us to experience delays in recognizing revenue or even to lose sales altogether, and any additional hurricanes, flooding or other natural disasters or other external events, such as political unrest, acts of war or terrorism, affecting areas in which our products are sold could result in decreased numbers of cases using our products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may acquire new products, technologies, businesses or companies and if we are unable to successfully complete these acquisitions or to integrate acquired businesses, we may fail to realize expected benefits or harm our existing business.\nWe have acquired new products from other companies and may seek to acquire additional products, technologies, businesses or companies in the future. We may not be able to successfully integrate newly acquired products, technologies, businesses or companies into our operations, and the process of integration could be expensive and time consuming, and may strain our resources. Furthermore, we may not be successful in commercializing acquired products or technologies. Other risks associated with acquisitions may include:\n\u2022the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture;\n\u2022technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected;\n\u2022we may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities;\n\u2022we may fail to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business;\n\u2022higher than expected finance costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in which the acquired business conducts its operations;\n\u2022we may experience problems in retaining suppliers or customers of the acquired business;\n\u2022we may not be able to effectively integrate internal control processes of the acquired business into our business; and\n\u2022we may not be able to operate acquired businesses profitably.\nConsequently, we may not achieve anticipated benefits of the acquisitions, which could harm our existing business. In addition, future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or expenses, or other charges such as in-process research and development, any of which could harm our business and affect our financial results or cause a reduction in the price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nOur ability to market the Peripheral OAS in the United States is limited to use as a therapy in patients with PAD and our ability to market the Coronary OAS in the United States is limited to use as a therapy in patients with severely calcified CAD, and if we want to expand our marketing claims or release new products, we will need to file for additional FDA clearances or approvals and conduct further clinical trials, which would be expensive and time consuming and may not be successful.\nWe received FDA 510(k) clearances in the United States for use of the Peripheral OAS as a therapy in patients with PAD, and we received PMA to use the Coronary OAS as a therapy in patients with severely calcified CAD. These clearances and approvals restrict our ability to market or advertise the Peripheral OAS and the Coronary OAS beyond these uses and, as such, could limit our growth.\nIf we determine to market our orbital technology in the United States for other uses, we would need to conduct further clinical trials and obtain premarket approval from the FDA. Clinical trials are complex, expensive, time consuming, uncertain and subject to substantial and unanticipated delays. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain FDA approval to use our orbital atherectomy technology for applications other than the treatment of PAD and CAD.\nWe are also developing several new products, all of which will require clearances or approvals from the FDA. Such clearances or approvals will be conditioned on, in some cases, clinical trials relating to such products. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such clearances or approvals.\nWe are or will be subject to an extensive set of post-market controls that apply to us as we commercialize our products, including annual PMA reports, Medical Device Reports on serious adverse events, complaint handling and analysis under the FDA\u2019s QSR, export controls, advertising and promotion requirements, and potential post-market studies required by the FDA.\nWe and our suppliers are also subject to regulation by various state authorities, which may inspect our or our suppliers\u2019 facilities and manufacturing processes and enforce state regulations. Failure to comply with applicable state regulations may result in seizures, injunctions or other types of enforcement actions.\nWe are also selling, and seeking to sell, our current and future products in other countries, which have their own requirements for the development, approval and sale of products in their countries. There is no assurance we will be able to obtain or maintain approvals in other countries for the sale of our products, and failure to comply with applicable foreign laws and regulations may result in seizures, injunctions or other types of enforcement actions and the inability of our products to be sold.\nOur promotion of our current and future products is closely controlled by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and internationally, and enforcement activities could limit our ability to inform potential customers of the features of the products.\nOur products may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation and product liability claims that could exceed the limits of available insurance coverage.\nThe FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material regulatory deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture, and we also may institute voluntary recalls of our products. Since commercialization of the Peripheral OAS, we have had instances of recalls, including a recall of our OAS saline infusion pump in April 2017 and other smaller recalls of particular lots of certain products. In fiscal 2022, we recalled the WIRION Embolic Protection System due to nine complaints of filter breakage during retrieval (of 697 total units distributed), and we recalled two lots of the Peripheral OAS (16 devices total) due to labeling inaccuracies. Any recalls of our products or products that we distribute would divert managerial and financial resources, harm our reputation with customers and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlso, if any of our products is defectively designed, manufactured or labeled, contain defective components or are misused, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients. The use, misuse or off-label use of our products may result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business. We cannot prevent a physician from using any of our products for off-label applications. While we have product liability insurance coverage for our products and intend to maintain such insurance coverage in the future, there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected from claims that are brought against us.\nWe are subject to many laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.\nOur products and related manufacturing processes, clinical data, adverse events, recalls and corrections and promotional activities are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. In particular, we are required to comply with the QSR and other regulations, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of any product for which we obtain marketing clearance or approval. We are also responsible for the quality of components received by our suppliers. Failure to comply with the QSR requirements or other statutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, or failure to adequately respond to any observations, could result in, among other things:\n\u2022warning or other letters from the FDA;\n\u2022fines, injunctions and civil penalties;\n\u2022product recall or seizure;\n\u2022unanticipated expenditures;\n\u2022delays in clearing or approving or refusal to clear or approve products;\n\u2022withdrawal or suspension of approval or clearance by the FDA or other regulatory bodies;\n\u2022orders for physician notification or device repair, replacement or refund;\n\u2022operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production or clinical trials; and\n\u2022criminal prosecution.\nIf any of these actions were to occur, it would harm our reputation and cause our product sales to suffer.\nIn addition, our relationships with physicians, hospitals and the marketers of our products are subject to scrutiny under various anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and similar laws, often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws, as further described below.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of these laws, we, as well as our employees, may be subject to penalties, including monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration health programs, workers\u2019 compensation programs and TRICARE (the healthcare system administered by or on behalf of the U.S. Department of Defense for uniformed services beneficiaries, including active duty and their dependents, retirees and their dependents), and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.\nIn addition, we have agreements with federal, state and local government agencies, such as the Veterans Administration, and third-party healthcare providers that receive government funding to sell our products. We are subject to extensive regulatory compliance obligations in the award, performance and administration of our government contracts, including regulations relating to procurement integrity, pricing protection, export control, government security, employment practices, accuracy of records and the recording of costs. The other parties to these agreements have the right to audit us to determine whether we are in compliance with these agreements. Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, repayment of amounts, the assessment of penalties and fines, and/or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting in the future, any of which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and customer standards prohibiting, among other things, \u201ckickbacks\u201d and false and fraudulent claims which, if violated, could subject us to substantial penalties and loss of business. Additionally, any challenges to or investigations into our practices under these laws could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business.\nThe federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, and similar state and foreign laws, prohibit payments that are intended to induce health care professionals or others either to refer patients or to purchase, lease, order or arrange for or recommend the purchase, lease or order of healthcare products or services. A number of states have enacted laws that require pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor and report payments, gifts and other remuneration made to physicians and other health care professionals and health care organizations. In addition, some state statutes, most notably laws in Massachusetts and Vermont, impose outright bans on certain gifts to physicians as well as requiring reporting of payments to physicians. Some of these laws, referred to as \u201caggregate spend\u201d or \u201cgift\u201d laws, carry substantial fines if they are violated. The Sunshine Act requires us to collect and report certain data on payments and other transfers of value to physicians, teaching hospitals and other covered recipients. In addition, foreign countries in which our products are or will be sold may have similar disclosure requirements.\nPublic reporting under the Sunshine Act and implementing Open Payments regulations has resulted in increased scrutiny of the financial relationships between industry, physicians, teaching hospitals and other covered recipients. These anti-kickback, public reporting and aggregate spend laws and the fraud and abuse laws affect our sales, marketing, promotional and clinical activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, we may have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers or users of medical devices. They also impose additional administrative and compliance burdens on us. In particular, these laws influence, among other things, how we structure our sales offerings, including discount practices, customer support, education and training programs, physician consulting and other service arrangements, and clinical trials. If we were to offer or pay inappropriate inducements to purchase our products, we could be subject to a claim under the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute or similar state and foreign laws. If we fail to comply with particular reporting requirements, we could be subject to penalties under applicable federal or state laws. Other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payments to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Although we do not submit claims directly to government healthcare programs or other payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to \u201ccause\u201d the submission of false or fraudulent claims by providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, by providing improper financial inducements, or through certain other activities.\nIn providing billing and coding information to customers, we make every effort to ensure that the billing and coding information furnished is accurate and that treating physicians understand that they are responsible for all treatment decisions. Nevertheless, we cannot provide assurance that the government will regard any billing errors that may be made as inadvertent or that the government will not examine our role in providing information to our customers and physicians concerning the benefits of therapy with our devices. Likewise, our financial relationships with customers, physicians, or others in a position to influence the purchase or use of our products may be subject to government scrutiny or be alleged or found to violate applicable fraud and abuse laws. False claims laws prescribe civil, criminal and administrative penalties for noncompliance, which can be substantial. Moreover, an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity, and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business and results of operations.\nOn June 28, 2016, we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the United States of America, acting through the DOJ and on behalf of the OIG, and Travis Thams, who filed the qui tam complaint underlying the DOJ\u2019s investigation (the \u201cCivil Action\u201d), to resolve the investigation by the DOJ and the Civil Action. The existence of the investigation and subsequent settlement could negatively affect our reputation and harm our business and results of operations. In addition, the release we received from the government in the Settlement Agreement related to particular conduct alleged in the complaint underlying the investigation. If the government determines that other conduct alleged in the complaint for which the government did not grant us a release merits additional investigation or if the government pursues any action against us relating to this other alleged conduct, then we may need to expend additional amounts to defend ourselves, our management would undergo the distraction of additional investigation and potential litigation, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nFinally, our customers have their own codes of conduct and standards with which we must comply to do business with them. If a customer determines that we or our sales representatives have violated these codes and standards, they may cease to do business with us, which would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nOur international expansion subjects us to increased legal and regulatory requirements, which could have a material effect on our business.\nOur expansion of sales into international markets subjects us and our products to different and increased laws and regulations, including foreign medical device regulations; tax laws; employment, immigration and labor laws; local intellectual property laws, which may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the United States; increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; import, export and sanction laws and regulations; privacy laws such as the European General Data Protection Regulation; and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws. Although we have and will continue to implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, distributors and agents, as well as those companies to which we will outsource certain aspects of our business operations, including those based in foreign countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws may be customary, will comply with our internal policies. Some of our distributors may appoint sub-distributors of our products and we will have limited ability to control the actions of these sub-distributors, but we may be held responsible by governmental authorities for the actions of these sub-distributors. We will incur additional compliance costs associated with global operations, and any alleged or actual violations of these laws and regulations could subject us to government scrutiny, severe criminal or civil fines, sanctions and other liabilities, and prohibitions on business conduct, and could negatively affect our business, reputation, operating results, and financial condition. The sale and use of our devices is also subject to reimbursement and third-party payor systems in other countries, which may involve lower reimbursement than in the United States and increased pricing pressure, resulting in lower revenue and margins on our products sold outside of the United States. Furthermore, geopolitical developments in international markets, such as unrest and political developments in Hong Kong,\nwhere OrbusNeich is headquartered, and COVID-19-related plant closings in China, where some of our distributed products and some components in our products are manufactured, could have a negative effect on the ability of us or our distributors to operate and sell our products or disrupt the supply chain for our suppliers and products, all of which would negatively affect our business.\nNew regulatory requirements will impose additional burdens on us, and our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to satisfy all applicable new requirements in a timely fashion.\nNew regulations impacting our products are periodically adopted. These regulations may require us to change our existing product designs in order to continue marketing our products, which could result in increased expenditures and in risks that we may be unable to successfully change our designs to satisfy the new requirements. For example, the new EU MDR came into effect in May 2021. We have taken steps to ensure our compliance with EU MDR but we could experience unforeseen delays, which could delay or prevent our ability to sell products in the European market. Any delays in selling our products resulting from non-compliance with EU MDR and other new regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nHealthcare reform legislation could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nThere have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control healthcare costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system, some of which have been enacted into law, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cPatient Act\u201d). The Patient Act and any additional healthcare proposals and laws that may be enacted in the future could also limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products. The Patient Act and future healthcare legislation could adversely affect our revenue and financial condition. The U.S. Congress has in the past considered legislation to repeal, modify or replace the Patient Act and there have been multiple challenges to the Patient Act through the U.S. court system. Although the Patient Act has survived these court challenges, these efforts may continue. We cannot predict the outcome of these legislative and judicial efforts and, as a result, we cannot predict the effect that any such repeal, modification or replacement will have on our business and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with data privacy and security laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to state, federal and foreign laws relating to data privacy and security in the conduct of our business, including state breach notification laws, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation. These laws affect how we collect and use data of our employees, consultants, customers and other parties. Furthermore, these laws impose substantial requirements that require the expenditure of significant funds and employee time to comply, and additional states and countries are enacting new data privacy and security laws, which will require future expansion of our compliance efforts. We also rely on third-parties to host or otherwise process some of this data, and any failure by a third party to prevent security breaches could have adverse consequences for us. In addition, the FDA has issued guidance to which we may be subject with respect to data security for medical devices. We will need to expend additional resources and make significant investments to comply with data privacy and security laws. Our failure to comply with these laws or prevent security breaches of such data could result in significant liability under applicable laws, cause disruption to our business, harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur failure to comply with environmental, health safety and social laws and standards may result in liabilities, expenses and restrictions on our operations and harm our reputation.\nOur operations are subject to regulatory requirements relating to the environment, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances. Environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations. Our manufacturing and research and development operations use hazardous substances and are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to hazardous substances. We have policies and procedures relating to the use and disposal of hazardous substances, and the instructions for use of our products, which are disposable, contain information on the proper disposal of the products after use, but the use of hazardous substances in our business nevertheless exposes us to risks of damages and liabilities relating to these hazardous substances. We cannot provide assurances that violations of these laws and regulations will not occur in the future or have not occurred in the past as a result of human error, accidents, equipment failure or other causes. If we violate environmental or health and safety laws, we could be liable for damages and fines that could exceed our existing insurance coverage, damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, there is an increasing focus by investors, customers and suppliers on environmental and social issues. Our investors, customers and suppliers have adopted, or may adopt, policies that include environmental and social standards with\nwhich they expert or desire us to comply. These environmental or social standards and initiatives are subject to change, can be unpredictable, and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with, given the complexity of our supply chain and the outsourced manufacturing of certain components of our products. If we are unable to comply, or are unable to cause our suppliers to comply, with such policies or provisions, these third parties may seek to cease to do business with us, either through divestiture of their stock holdings or ceasing to purchase products from us or supplying products to us, which could harm our reputation, revenue and results of operations.\nThe impact of restrictive trade policies in the United States and the potential corresponding actions by other countries could adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe U.S. federal government has implemented tariffs on certain products imported into the United States from China, and the Chinese government has responded with retaliatory tariffs on certain products, including medical devices, exported from the United States to China. In addition, changes by the U.S. government to the status of Hong Kong, where OrbusNeich is headquartered, which will subject Hong Kong to the same economic policy barriers as mainland China, could negatively affect the pricing and supply chain of products sold to and purchased from OrbusNeich, which could make it more difficult to expand the sales of these products and negatively affect our financial results. We cannot predict whether the United States will implement additional trade restrictions with respect to China or other countries and how such countries would respond to such trade restrictions. If these tariffs continue or are expanded, it would be more difficult to sell our products in China or other markets outside of the United States, if we seek to expand into the Chinese or other markets in the future. In addition, these tariffs may increase the costs of procuring component parts for our products from China or other countries. Restrictive trade policies may also harm the United States and global economies generally, which would adversely affect our business in a variety of ways, including reducing the market for our products, causing a downturn in the trading price of our common stock, and restricting access to credit if we seek it for future growth.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nOur inability to adequately protect our intellectual property could allow our competitors and others to produce products based on our technology, which could substantially impair our ability to compete.\nOur success and ability to compete depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements, to protect our intellectual property. Our issued patents and related intellectual property may not be adequate to protect us or permit us to gain or maintain a competitive advantage. We continue to develop new technologies and products, as well as enhancements to our existing products. The patent prosecution process is expensive, time-consuming and complex, and maintenance, renewal, annuity and other government fees may be significant. We cannot be assured that any of our pending or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us, and the coverage claimed in our patent applications could be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and issued patents may not be in a form that provides us with meaningful protection. We may also fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output in time to obtain patent protection. Further, if any patents we obtain or license are deemed invalid and unenforceable, or have their scope narrowed, it could impact our ability to commercialize or license our technology and achieve competitive advantages. Finally, patents have a limited lifespan. Once our primary issued patents expire, our remaining patents may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nChanges in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, if at all.\nWe may, in the future, need to assert claims of infringement against third parties to protect our intellectual property. The outcome of litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights in patents, copyrights, trade secrets or trademarks is highly unpredictable, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, reputation and results of operations regardless of the final outcome of such litigation.\nDespite our efforts to safeguard our unpatented and unregistered intellectual property rights, we may not be successful in doing so or the steps taken by us in this regard may not be adequate to detect or deter misappropriation of our technology or to prevent an unauthorized third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our products, technology or other information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to litigate, enforce or defend our intellectual property rights. Additionally, third parties may be able to design around our patents.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. In this regard, we seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by having a policy that our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors execute non-disclosure and assignment\nof invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement. We cannot provide any assurance that employees and third parties will abide by the confidentiality or assignment terms of these agreements, or that we will be effective in securing necessary assignments from these third parties.\nAccordingly, our products and technologies may not be protectable or remain protected by valid and enforceable intellectual property rights. Our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property could allow our competitors and others to produce products based on our technology, which could substantially impair our ability to compete and results of operations.\nClaims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others could prohibit us from commercializing products, require us to obtain licenses from third parties or require us to develop non-infringing alternatives, and subject us to substantial monetary damages and injunctive relief.\nThe medical technology industry is characterized by extensive litigation and administrative proceedings over patent and other intellectual property rights. The likelihood that patent infringement or misappropriation claims may be brought against us increases as we achieve more visibility in the marketplace and introduce products to market. We are aware of numerous patents issued to third parties that relate to the manufacture and use of medical devices for the treatment of vascular disease. The owners of each of these patents could assert that the manufacture, use or sale of our products infringes one or more claims of their patents. There could also be existing patents of which we are unaware that one or more aspects of our technology may inadvertently infringe. In some cases, litigation may be threatened or brought by a patent-holding company or other adverse patent owner who has no relevant product revenues and against whom our patents may provide little or no deterrence.\nAny infringement or misappropriation claim could cause us to incur significant costs, place significant strain on our financial resources, divert management\u2019s attention from our business and harm our reputation. If the relevant patents were upheld in litigation as valid and enforceable and we were found to infringe, we could be prohibited from commercializing any infringing products unless we could obtain licenses to use the technology covered by the patent or are able to design around the patent. We may be unable to obtain a license on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and we may not be able to redesign any infringing products to avoid infringement.", "PERMNO": 91365, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "CSII"}
