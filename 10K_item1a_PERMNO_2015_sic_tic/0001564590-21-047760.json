{"cik": "1591588", "company": "A-Mark Precious Metals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-09-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to our Operations\nOur business is heavily dependent on our credit facility.\nOur business depends substantially on our ability to obtain financing for our operations. The Trading Credit Facility (as further described and defined below) provides the Company with the liquidity to buy and sell billions of dollars of precious metals annually. The Trading Credit Facility is an uncommitted demand facility provided by a syndicate of financial institutions (the \u201cTrading Credit Lenders\u201d) and is currently scheduled to mature on March 25, 2022. A-Mark routinely uses funds drawn under the Trading Credit Facility to purchase metals from its suppliers and for operating cash flow purposes. Our CFC subsidiary also uses the funds drawn under the Trading Credit Facility to finance its lending activities.\nPursuant to the terms of the Trading Credit Facility, each Trading Credit Lender may, at any time in its sole discretion (subject to certain notice requirements), decline to make loans to us. If we are unable to access funds under the Trading Credit Facility, we may be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nThe Trading Credit Facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and to comply with various operational and other covenants. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Trading Credit Facility that was not cured or waived pursuant to the terms of the Trading Credit Facility, the Trading Credit Lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Trading Credit Facility to be due and payable immediately. Further, Trading Credit Lenders holding 50% or more of the indebtedness under the Trading Credit Facility may require us to repay all outstanding indebtedness under the Trading Credit Facility at any time, even if we are in compliance with the financial and other covenants under the Trading Credit Facility.\nWe cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments, including the Trading Credit Facility, upon demand or acceleration, or at maturity, or that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments under the Trading Credit Facility. The failure of A-Mark to renew or replace the Trading Credit Facility under such circumstances would reduce the financing available to us and could limit our ability to conduct our business, including the lending activity of our CFC subsidiary. There can be no assurance that we could procure replacement financing on commercially acceptable terms on a timely basis, or at all. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under the Trading Credit Facility, and if we were unable to repay the amounts outstanding thereunder, the administrative agent under the Trading Credit Facility could proceed against the collateral granted to secure such indebtedness.\nWe are subject to fluctuations in interest rates based on the variable interest terms of the Trading Credit Facility and we may not be able to pass along to our customers and borrowers some or any part of an increase in the interest that we are required to pay under the Trading Credit Facility. Amounts under the Trading Credit Facility bear interest based on one month LIBOR plus 2.50%. The LIBOR was approximately 0.10% as of June 30, 2021. The Trading Credit Facility agreement contains provisions to accommodate the replacement of the existing LIBOR-based rate with a successor Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) based rate upon a triggering event.\nFor risks related to the transition away from LIBOR, see \u201cGeneral Risk Factors-Uncertainty about the future of LIBOR may adversely affect our business,\u201d below.\nWe could suffer losses with our financing operations.\nWe engage in a variety of financing activities with our customers:\n\u2022\nReceivables from our customers with whom we trade in precious metal products are effectively short-term, non-interest bearing extensions of credit that are, in certain cases, secured by the related products maintained in the Company\u2019s possession or by a letter of credit issued on behalf of the customer. On average, these receivables are outstanding for periods of between 8 and 9 days.\n\u2022\nThe Company operates a financing business through CFC that makes secured loans at loan-to-value ratios-principal loan amount divided by the liquidation value, as conservatively estimated by management, of the collateral-of, in most cases, 50% to 85%. These loans are both variable and fixed interest rate loans, with some maturities on-demand and others from three to twelve months.\n\u2022\nWe make advances to our customers on unrefined metals secured by materials received from the customer. These advances are limited to a portion of the materials received.\n\u2022\nThe Company makes unsecured, short-term, non-interest bearing advances to wholesale metals dealers and government mints.\n\u2022\nThe Company periodically extends short-term credit through the issuance of notes receivable to approved customers at interest rates determined on a customer-by-customer basis.\nOur ability to minimize losses on the credit that we extend to our customers depends on a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour loan underwriting and other credit policies and controls designed to assure repayment, which may prove inadequate to prevent losses;\n\u2022\nour ability to sell collateral upon customer defaults for amounts sufficient to offset credit losses, which can be affected by a number of factors outside of our control, including (i) changes in economic conditions, including as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, (ii) increases in market rates of interest and (iii) changes in the condition or value of the collateral; and\n\u2022\nthe reserves we establish for loan losses, which may prove inadequate.\nLiquidity constraints may limit our ability to grow our business.\nWe will require adequate sources of liquidity to fund both our existing business and our strategy for expansion, evidenced most recently by our acquisition of JMB. Currently, our main sources of liquidity are the cash that we generate from operations, our borrowing availability under the Trading Credit Facility, and the proceeds from our securitization transaction through AMCF. There can be no assurance that these sources will be adequate to support the growth that we are hoping to achieve or that additional sources of financing for this purpose, in the form of additional debt or equity financing, will be available to us, on satisfactory terms or at all. Also, the Trading Credit Facility contains, and any future debt financing is likely to contain, various financial and other restrictive covenants. The need to comply with these covenants may limit our ability to implement our growth initiatives.\nWe are dependent on our key management personnel and our trading experts.\nOur strategic vision and performance is dependent on Greg Roberts, our Chief Executive Officer, other members of our senior management and certain other key employees. We have employment agreements with Mr. Roberts and Brian Aquilino, our Chief Operating Officer, which both expire on June 30, 2023, and with Thor Gjerdrum, our President, which expires on June 30, 2022. The continuing integration of JMB with our other businesses relies in part on the knowledge and experience of Michael Wittmeyer, the Chief Executive Officer of JMB. We recently entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Wittmeyer which terminates on June 30, 2024.\nThese and other employees have expertise in the trading markets, e-commerce operations and digital marketing; have industry-wide reputations; and perform critical functions for our business. We cannot offer assurance that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms for the renewal of the employment agreements or otherwise retain our key employees. Also, there is significant competition for skilled precious metals traders and other industry professionals. The loss of our current key officers and employees, without the ability to replace them, would have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely extensively on computer systems to execute trades and process transactions, and we could suffer substantial damages if the operation of these systems were interrupted.\nWe rely on our computer and communications hardware and software systems to execute a large volume of trading transactions each year. With the acquisition of JMB, whose sales are conducted exclusively through the internet, our dependence on computer and communications technology has further increased. It is therefore critical that we maintain uninterrupted operation of these systems, and we have invested considerable resources to protect our systems from physical compromise and security breaches and to maintain backup and redundancy. Nevertheless, our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, including breaches of our transaction processing or other systems, catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our employees. If our systems are breached, damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to provide quotations or trading services in the interim, and we may face costly litigation.\nRisks Related to World Events\nOur business is influenced by political conditions and world events.\nThe precious metals business is especially subject to global political conditions and world events. Precious metals are viewed by some as a secure financial investment in times of political upheaval or unrest, particularly in developing economies, which may drive up pricing. The volatility of the commodity prices for precious metals is also likely to increase in politically uncertain times. Conversely, during periods of relative international calm precious metal volatility is likely to decrease, along with demand, and the prices of precious metals may retreat. Because our business is dependent on the volatility and pricing of precious metals, we are likely to be influenced by world events more than businesses in other economic sectors.\nThe Company has experienced outsized growth in its revenues and operating profits since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, but there can be no assurance that this level of performance will continue, and its performance may drop as the pandemic and its related effects subside.\nThe recent growth of the business of the Company generally, and the business of its recently acquired JMB subsidiary in particular, may be attributed to the unprecedented uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, its effects on the economy and the related government responses. Other contemporary events and circumstances, including the presidential election, the change in administration and perceived related political polarization and instability, may also have been contributing factors to the recent growth of the business of the Company. In this environment, consumers may have sought perceived financial safety in precious coins and metals.\nThere can be no assurance that the recent growth in the precious metals business will continue in future periods or will not decline as the pandemic and its effects on the economy, the business environment and the responsive actions of government subside, or as the current political environment becomes less charged. Even if the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the domestic and world markets, or the perceived political instability, continue for an extended period of time, consumer perceptions with respect to precious coins and metals could shift, these commodities may no longer be viewed as secure investments and the demand for the Company\u2019s products could substantially decline. We cannot predict the performance of our business and operations if and when business conditions revert to more normalized levels. A decline in our future revenues and earnings would have adverse effects on our overall results of operations and could cause our stock price to decline. Moreover, because of the unprecedented nature of the current business and financial environment, particularly in regards to the precious metal industry, it is not possible to create with any acceptable measure of precision customary financial projections and forecasts for our business over the next several years. This could adversely affect our ability to engage in financial and operational planning for the future.\nOur business could also be adversely affected by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has caused significant disruption in the financial markets both globally and in the United States. While there have been positive effects of the market reaction to the outbreak on our business, as precious metals prices have experienced increased volatility resulting in enhanced pricing spreads and improved profitability, we do not know how long these effects will continue and cannot predict their future magnitude. The continued disruption in the financial markets could have adverse effects on our businesses in the future, including with respect to the following:\n\u2022\nWe maintain facilities for our clients\u2019 and our own precious metal and numismatic inventories, where we receive and store these products and from which we make shipments for physical settlement in our trading activity. We have implemented procedures at these facilities to ensure social distancing and minimize the risk of infected personnel. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an outbreak of infection at these facilities, which could necessitate their closure or the curtailment of their activity.\n\u2022\nWe engage in transactions with numerous financial counterparties. If these parties were to experience significant financial reversals, for example as a result of investments in sectors that have suffered severe downturns as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, these parties may be unable to comply with their financial obligations to us, may cease transacting business with us or could curtail or terminate the credit that they extend to us. While we deal with a significant number of counterparties, we nonetheless have concentration in our customer base. To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic were to materially and adversely affect the financial condition of customers responsible for a material portion of our revenues, our business could be correspondingly impaired.\n\u2022\nWe require a regular supply of newly minted coins and other numismatics in the conduct of our coin and bar and retail businesses. We conduct the AMST joint venture, which supplies a portion of our requirements for silver products. We are also dependent on the production of gold and silver mints around the world for the supply of the majority of our product requirements. A number of mints, and refineries that supply gold and silver for the mints, reduced the capacity of their operations during the COVID-19 crisis, and as a result we have experienced periods when precious metals products were unavailable to us. The uncertainty regarding the availability of coin and other products could make it difficult for us to commit to future delivery, could make it more difficult for us to forecast and plan for our coin and bar operations and could otherwise adversely impact this aspect of our business.\n\u2022\nWe rely on specialized, armored vehicles provided by third party commercial services to transport precious metals and numismatics to and from our customers and from the mints and our other suppliers. If these vehicles were deemed essential to other customers in the current crisis, such that we were unable to obtain adequate use of the vehicles, our ability to make physical settlement of our trading activity, to provide storage services to our customers, and to obtain necessary inventory would be curtailed and could be suspended entirely.\nWe have significant operations outside the United States.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from business outside the United States, including from customers in developing countries. Business operations outside the U.S. are subject to political, economic and other risks inherent in operating in foreign\ncountries. These include risks of general applicability, such as the need to comply with multiple regulatory regimes; trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; and fluctuations in equity, revenues and profits due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Currently, we do not conduct substantial business with customers in developing countries. However, if our business in these areas of the world were to increase, we would also face risks that are particular to developing countries, including the difficulty of enforcing agreements, collecting receivables, protecting inventory and other assets through foreign legal systems, limitations on the repatriation of earnings, currency devaluation and manipulation of exchange rates, and high levels of inflation.\nWe try to manage these risks by monitoring current and anticipated political, economic, legal and regulatory developments in the countries outside the United States in which we operate or have customers and adjusting operations as appropriate, but there can be no assurance that the measures we adopt will be successful in protecting the Company\u2019s business interests.\nRisks Related to our Wholesale Sales & Ancillary Services Segment\nOur business is dependent on a concentrated customer base.\nOne of A-Mark's key assets is the customer base of its Wholesale Sales & Ancillary Services segment. This customer base provides deep distribution of product and makes A-Mark a desirable trading partner for precious metals product manufacturers, including sovereign mints seeking to distribute precious metals coinage or large refiners seeking to sell large volumes of physical precious metals. If our relationships with these customers deteriorated, or if we were to lose these customers, our business would be materially adversely affected.\nThe loss of a government purchaser/distributorship arrangement could materially adversely affect our business.\nA-Mark\u2019s business is heavily dependent on its purchaser/distributorship arrangements with various governmental mints. Our ability to offer numismatic coins and bars to our customers on a competitive basis is based on the ability to purchase products directly from a government source. The arrangements with the governmental mints may be discontinued by them at any time. The loss of an authorized purchaser/distributor relationship, including with the U.S. Mint, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe business of buying and selling precious metals is global and highly competitive. The Company competes with precious metals firms and banks throughout North America, Europe and elsewhere in the world, some of whom have greater financial and other resources, and greater name recognition, than the Company. We believe that, as a full-service firm devoted exclusively to precious metals trading, we offer pricing, product availability, execution, financing alternatives and storage options that are attractive to our customers and allow us to compete effectively. We also believe that our purchaser/distributorship arrangements with various governmental mints give us a competitive advantage in our coin distribution business. However, given the global reach of the precious metals business, the absence of intellectual property protections and the availability of numerous, evolving platforms for trading in precious metals, we cannot assure you that A-Mark will be able to continue to compete successfully or that future developments in the industry will not create additional competitive challenges.\nThe Company is subject to risks relating to its AMST operations.\nAMST depends on critical pieces of equipment which may be out of service occasionally for scheduled upgrades or maintenance or as a result of unanticipated failures or business interruptions. AMST\u2019s facilities are subject to equipment failures and the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, earthquakes, accidents or violent weather conditions. AMST has insurance to cover certain of the risks associated with equipment damage and resulting business interruption, but there are certain events that would not be covered by insurance and there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available on acceptable terms. Interruptions in AMST\u2019s processing and production capabilities and shutdowns resulting from unanticipated events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAMST's ability to continue to expand the scope of its services and customer base depends in part on its ability to increase the size of its skilled labor force. The inability to employ or retain skilled technical personnel could adversely affect AMST\u2019s operating results. In the past, the demand for skilled personnel has been high and the supply limited.\nWe have in the past engaged, and continue to engage, in transactions with Stack\u2019s Bowers, an affiliate of the Company, which could be perceived as not being made at arms-length.\nStack\u2019s-Bowers Numismatics, LLC (\"Stack's Bowers\"), which is primarily engaged in the business of auctions of high-value and rare coins and in coin retailing, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SGI, our former parent and a related party. We have engaged in the past, and continue to engage, in transactions with Stack\u2019s Bowers, some of which are presently on-going. These transactions include secured lending transactions in which Stack\u2019s Bowers is the borrower, and other transactions involving the purchase and sale of rare coins, including with JMB. SGI and the Company have a common chief executive officer, and the chief executive officer and the general counsel of the Company are board members of SGI. In addition, a majority of the board of directors of the Company has retained an ownership interest in SGI that in the aggregate represents a controlling interest in SGI. All transactions between the Company and\nStack\u2019s Bowers are approved by our Audit Committee, and we believe that all such transactions are on terms no less favorable to the Company than would be obtained from an unaffiliated third party. Nonetheless, these transactions could be perceived as being conflicted.\nThe materials held by A-Mark are subject to loss, damage, theft or restriction on access.\nA-Mark has significant quantities of high-value precious metals on site, at third-party depositories and in transit. There is a risk that part or all of the gold and other precious metals held by A-Mark, whether on its own behalf or on behalf of its customers, could be lost, damaged or stolen. In addition, access to A-Mark\u2019s precious metals could be restricted by natural events (such as an earthquake) or human actions (such as a terrorist attack). Although we maintain insurance on terms and conditions that we consider appropriate, we may not have adequate sources of recovery if our precious metals inventory is lost, damaged, stolen or destroyed, and recovery may be limited. Among other things, our insurance policies exclude coverage in the event of loss as a result of terrorist attacks or civil unrest.\nIn addition, with the establishment of our Logistics facility and the transfer of our wholesale storage operations from third party depositories to that facility, we are assuming greater potential liability for any loss suffered in connection with the stored inventory. Among other things, our insurance, rather than the third-party depository\u2019s, is now the primary risk policy. While we believe we have adequate insurance coverage covering these operations, in the event of any loss in excess of our coverage, we may be held liable for that excess.\nOur Logistics depository is subject to authorization.\nOur Trading Credit Lenders have approved our Logistics facility as an authorized depository. If that approval were to be withdrawn for any reason, we would no longer be able to keep inventory at that location, which would substantially limit our ability to conduct business from that facility.\nRisks Related to our Direct-to Consumer Segment\nOur Direct-to-Consumer businesses could be subject to accusations of improper sales practices.\nThrough our JMB and Goldline subsidiaries, the Company sells precious metals and numismatics directly to the retail investor community. JMB markets its products over the internet. Goldline markets its precious metal products on television, radio, and over the internet, and through customer service outreach. Prior to its acquisition by the Company, Goldline had been accused of improper sales practices, and was the subject of a state enforcement action that was subsequently settled. Other retailers of precious metal products have similarly been the subject of accusations regarding their sales practices, including claims of misrepresentation, excessive product markups, pressured sales tactics and product switching. The Company believes that the sales practices of its Goldline subsidiary conform to applicable legal and ethical standards, and that there is no material basis for claims against Goldline in this regard. Nevertheless, given the nature of the retail precious metals business, the possibility that investors in precious metals may lose a substantial portion of their investment as a result of adverse market trends and the vulnerability of certain retail precious metal investors to economic loss, there can be no assurance that claims will not be made regarding business practices of Goldline or JMB or that, if made, such claims will not attract the attention of governmental and private sector consumer advocates. Were this to occur, the Company could suffer adverse publicity, be subject to governmental enforcements actions or be forced to modify the sales and marketing practices of its direct-to-consumer business.\nOur Direct-to-Consumer businesses operate in a highly competitive environment.\nJMB and Goldline face competition from both traditional precious metal retail brokers and coin stores, as well as other specialty online precious metal and coin sites, such as APMEX, Inc., SD Bullion, Inc., and Bullion Exchange, LLC. In addition, certain general online merchandisers such as eBay also offer collectible coins and bullion for sale, and other major online retailers, with financial and marketing resources, name recognition and a customer base that are far greater than those that are available to JMB and Goldline, may in the future enter this market. Competition is based upon the demand and availability of coin and bullion product, price, delivery times, convenience and customer service. There can be no assurance that JMB and Goldline will be able to compete effectively with other retail sources and channels for precious coin and bullion, especially if the demand for these products were to contract from its current record high levels.\nJMB\u2019s search engine optimization strategies have provided it with an important competitive advantage, but this may not continue.\nWe believe that the internally developed search engine optimization (SEO) strategies of JMB provide its business with a competitive advantage in driving traffic to its sites over other e-commerce precious metal retailers and have been a significant factor in the growth of JMB. The challenges of efficient SEO programming are continually evolving, and other e-commerce retailers in the precious metal space are constantly working to improve their own SEO capabilities. If JMB does not continue to maintain its competitive edge in SEO technology, it could lose customers and market share to its competitors.\nJMB relies upon paid and unpaid internet search engines to rank its product offerings and drive traffic to its website, and its website traffic may suffer if its rankings decline or its relationship with these services deteriorates.\nJMB relies on paid and unpaid internet search engines to attract consumer interest in its product offerings. Search engine companies change their natural search engine algorithms periodically, and these changes may adversely affect JMB\u2019s product offerings in paid and/or unpaid searches. JMB may also at times be subject to ranking penalties if the operators of search engines believe it is not in compliance with their guidelines. If JMB\u2019s search engine rankings decline, and JMB is unable to timely regain its prior rankings, it may have to use more expensive marketing channels to sustain and grow its revenues, resulting in reduced profitability.\nIf JMB and Goldline do not respond effectively to technological and market changes, they will cease to be competitive with other channels that consumers may have for the purchase of precious coins and bullion.\nTo remain competitive, JMB must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality and features of its online operations. The internet and the electronic commerce industry are characterized by rapid technological change, changes in user and customer requirements and preferences, frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies, and the emergence of new industry standards and practices.\nThe evolving nature of the internet could render JMB\u2019s existing technology and systems obsolete. Its continuing success will depend, in part, on its ability to:\n\u2022\ndevelop, license or acquire leading technologies useful in its business;\n\u2022\ndevelop new features and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated preferences of its customers; and\n\u2022\nrespond to technological advances and emerging industry and regulatory standards and practices in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nWith the growth of e-commerce, the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the shipping and logistics industries is faster now than in years past. This accelerated pace of change increases uncertainty and places a greater burden on management to anticipate and respond to such changes. The increased pace of change also means that the window in which a technologically advanced or sophisticated product or service can achieve and maintain partner and consumer interest is shrinking and, to the extent JMB fails to timely anticipate or respond to changes in its industry, the effects of such missteps may be amplified.\nFuture advances in technology may not be beneficial to, or compatible with, JMB\u2019s or Goldline\u2019s businesses. Furthermore, JMB and Goldline may be unsuccessful in using new technologies effectively or adapting their technology and systems to user requirements or emerging industry standards on a timely basis. Their ability to remain technologically competitive may require substantial expenditures and lead time. If JMB or Goldline is unable to adapt in a timely manner and at reasonable cost to changing market conditions or user requirements, it will cease to be competitive with other channels for the purpose of precious coins and bullion.\nIf JMB fails to continuously improve its website (on all relevant platforms, including mobile), it may not attract or retain customers.\nJMB must continually update its website (on all relevant platforms, including mobile) to improve and enhance its content, accessibility, convenience and ease of use. Failure to do so may create a perception that the websites of JMB\u2019s competitors are easier to use and navigate or that they are better able to service customer needs for precious metal coins and bullion. If such a perception were to gain currency, traffic to JMB\u2019s website and its revenues would suffer.\nCertain of JMB\u2019s websites publish data concerning the precious metal markets obtained from third parties, which could be inaccurate.\nJMB\u2019s silverprice.org and goldprice.org publish data on precious metal and cryptocurrency pricing which is obtained from third parties. While we believe that the sources of the published data are reliable, the data is not independently verified by JMB or us. If the data that JMB receives and publishes were inaccurate, and were relied upon by consumers visiting these websites, JMB could be exposed to liability and may suffer damage to its reputation.\nJMB expects to profit on precious metals acquired from its customers, but that might not be the case.\nOne of the services that JMB provides to its customers is its program of offering to repurchase precious coins and bullion owned by its customers. We believe that this program encourages the purchase of coins and bullion as an investment because it assures JMB\u2019s customers that their investment in the products offered by JMB will be liquid and can be monetized if the customers have a need for cash. JMB offers to repurchase coins and bullion from its customers at prices designed to reflect current market valuations, but also allows JMB to profit on the resale of the products. There can be no assurance, however, that JMB will in fact be able to resell product that it repurchases at a price that will justify the cost of repurchase. In a declining market for precious metal products, JMB could be burdened with substantial amounts of repurchased inventory that it is unable to resell at an economic price, or at all. If JMB were to suspend or discontinue its offer to repurchase coin and bullion from its customers because of adverse market conditions, it could antagonize its customers and impair the perception among its customers that precious coin and bullion is a safe and attractive investment.\nThe Company\u2019s joint venture, Precious Metals Purchasing Partners, LLC, is subject to risks which may affect our ability to successfully operate the joint venture.\nThe Company owns 50% of Precious Metals Purchasing Partners, LLC, (\"PMPP\"), a joint venture which commenced operations in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. PMPP purchases products primarily from end-user retail customers, which are then sold to the Company, related parties of the Company or third parties.\nThe Company\u2019s interest in PMPP is subject to the risks customarily associated with the conduct of joint ventures, including the risk of (i) failure to agree on strategic decisions requiring the approval of both parties, (ii) failure of the joint venture partner to meet its obligations, and (iii) disputes between the joint venturers or litigation regarding joint venture matters. Each of these risks could have a material adverse impact on the viability of PMPP, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, because PMPP engages in transactions with retail customers, it could be subject to risks and accusations similar to those discussed above with respect to the Company\u2019s direct-to-consumer businesses.\nRisks Related to our Secured Lending Segment\nCFC may in certain circumstances be required to repurchase loans that it has securitized.\nCFC has entered into a securitization financing whereby it has transferred, and may continue from time to time to transfer, to its subsidiary AMCF loans secured by precious metal coins or bullion. AMCF has issued 4.98% Class A Notes due 2023 and 5.98% Class B Notes due 2023 which are secured by these loans and related assets. While the notes are non-recourse to the Company or CFC, CFC is required to provide certain warranties concerning the loans and the security interest in the metals collateral securing the loans. In the event the warranties made with respect to any loan are breached and the breach materially and adversely affects the interests of the noteholders, CFC is required to either cure the breach or repurchase the loan within specified a timeframe. If CFC were to default on its repurchase obligations, this could materially adversely affect the business of CFC, and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s future ability to access the credit markets.\nCFC and the Company have exposure to the performance of AM Capital Funding.\nRegulation RR of the SEC requires the sponsor of an asset-backed securitization transaction, or certain of its affiliates, to retain an economic interest in the transaction. In compliance with this rule, CFC retained the equity interest in AMCF, and the Company currently holds $5.0 million of Class B Notes, which are subordinated to the Class A Notes. In addition, CFC and the Company may, from time to time, also contribute cash or sell precious metals to AMCF in exchange for subordinated, deferred payment obligations from AMCF. If the performance of AMCF were to suffer such that AMCF were unable to service its notes, CFC and the Company could lose part or all of their investments in AMCF.\nUnder the terms of the servicing arrangements for the precious metals loan securitization, CFC may be required to liquidate the collateral securing securitized loans, even if this would impair relationships with its customers.\nCFC is the servicer for the loans transferred to AMCF in the securitization transaction. If, under certain circumstances, the equity levels of the obligors on particular loans falls below a specified level and those obligors fail to pay in additional equity, CFC is required to liquidate the metals collateral securing those loans within a specified time period. CFC does not have the flexibility to defer or refrain from the liquidation, even if CFC were to determine that it would be in its best interests to do so. This requirement could impair valuable relationships that the Company may otherwise have with its customers whose loans have been securitized.\nRisks Relating to Commodities\nA-Mark\u2019s business is heavily influenced by volatility in commodities prices.\nA primary driver of A-Mark\u2019s profitability is volatility in commodities prices, which leads to wider bid and ask spreads. Among the factors that can impact the price of precious metals are supply and demand of precious metals; political, economic, and global financial events; movement of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies; and the activity of large speculators such as hedge funds. If commodity prices were to stagnate, there would likely be a reduction in trading activity, resulting in less demand for the services A-Mark provides, which could materially adversely affect our business, liquidity and results of operations.\nThis volatility may drive fluctuation of our revenues, as a consequence of which our results for any one period may not be indicative of the results to be expected for any other period. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nOur business is exposed to commodity price risks, and our hedging activity to protect our inventory is subject to risks of default by our counterparties.\nA-Mark\u2019s precious metals inventory is subject to market value changes created by change in the underlying commodity price, as well as supply and demand of the individual products the Company trades. In addition, open sale and purchase commitments are subject to changes in value between the date the purchase or sale is fixed (the trade date) and the date metal is delivered or received (the settlement date). A-Mark seeks to minimize the effect of price changes of the underlying commodity through the use of financial derivative instruments, such as forward and futures contracts. A-Mark\u2019s policy is to remain substantially hedged as to its inventory position and its individual sale and purchase commitments. A-Mark\u2019s management monitors its hedged exposure daily. However, there can be no assurance that these hedging activities will be adequate to protect the Company against commodity price risks associated with A-Mark\u2019s business activities.\nFurthermore, even if we are fully hedged as to any given position, there is the risk of default by our counterparties to the hedge. Any such default could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nIncreased commodity pricing could limit the inventory that we are able to carry.\nWe maintain a large and varied inventory of precious metal products, including bullion and coins, in order to support our trading activities and provide our customers with superior service. The amount of inventory that we are able to carry is constrained by the borrowing limitations and working capital covenants under the Trading Credit Facility. If commodity prices were to rise substantially, and we were unable to modify the terms of the Trading Credit Facility to compensate for the increase, the quantity of product that we could finance, and hence maintain in our inventory, would fall. This would likely have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe rely on the efficient functioning of commodity exchanges around the world, and disruptions on these exchanges could adversely affect our business.\nThe Company buys and sells precious metals contracts on commodity exchanges around the world, both in support of its customer operations and to hedge its inventory and transactional exposure against fluctuations in commodity prices. The Company\u2019s ability to engage in these activities would be compromised if the exchanges on which the Company trades or any of their clearinghouses were to discontinue operations or to experience disruptions in trading, due to computer problems, unsettled markets or other factors. The Company may also experience risk of loss if futures commission merchants or commodity brokers with whom the Company deals were to become insolvent or bankrupt.\nOur business is subject to the risk of fraud and counterfeiting.\nThe precious metals (particularly bullion) business is exposed to the risk of loss as a result of \u201cmaterials fraud\u201d in its various forms. We seek to minimize our exposure to this type of fraud through a number of means, including third-party authentication and verification, reliance on our internal experts and the establishment of procedures designed to detect fraud. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing or identifying this type of fraud, or in obtaining redress in the event such fraud is detected.\nRisk Related to our Regulatory Environment\nWe are subject to laws and regulations.\nThere are various federal, state, local and foreign laws, ordinances and regulations that affect our trading business. For example, because of the nature and value of the products in which deal, we are required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and a variety of anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules in response to the USA Patriot Act.\nThe SEC has promulgated rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act regarding disclosure, on an annual basis, of the use of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, known as conflict minerals, in products manufactured by public companies. These rules require due diligence to determine whether such minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo (the \"DRC\") or an adjoining country and whether such minerals helped finance the armed conflict in the DRC.\nThe Company has concluded that it is not currently subject to the conflict minerals rules because it is not a manufacturer of conflict minerals under the definitions set forth in the rules. Depending on developments in the Company\u2019s business, it could become subject to the rules at some point in the future. In that event, there will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs to determine the origin of gold used in our products. In addition, the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of gold used in our products. Also, we may face disqualification as a supplier for customers and reputational challenges if the due diligence procedures we implement do not enable us to verify the origins for the gold used in our products or to determine that the gold is conflict free.\nCFC operates under a California Finance Lenders License issued by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. CFC is required to submit a finance lender law annual report to the state which summarizes certain loan portfolio and financial information regarding CFC. The Department of Financial Protection and Innovation may audit the books and records of CFC\nto determine whether CFC is in compliance with the terms of its lending license. In addition, although we do not believe that our activities fall within the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, we have been subject to investigation by this agency, which may in the future, along with other federal and state agencies, seek to assert oversight over aspects of CFC's operations.\nThere can be no assurance that the regulation of our trading and lending businesses will not increase or that compliance with the applicable regulations will not become more costly or require us to modify our business practices.\nFor other risks related to government regulation, see \u201cGeneral Risk Factors- We are subject to other laws and regulations,\u201d below.\nCompliance with new data protection/privacy statutes could increase our costs and expose the Company to possible sanctions for violation.\nBy reason of our Direct-to-Consumer business in particular, we collect personal data.\nIn 2016, the European Union (\"EU\") adopted a comprehensive overhaul of its data protection regime from the current national legislative approach to a single European Economic Area Privacy Regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which went into effect in May 2018. The EU data protection regime expands the scope of the EU data protection law to all foreign companies processing personal data of EU residents, imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to the greater of 4% of worldwide turnover or \u20ac20 million, and includes new rights such as the \u201cportability\u201d of personal data. Although the GDPR will apply across the EU without a need for local implementing legislation, EU member states have the ability to interpret the GDPR opening clauses, which permit region-specific data protection legislation and have the potential to create inconsistencies on a country-by-country basis.\nThe Company has an office in Vienna, Austria that provides marketing support services for our international (including EU) customers. Although our international operations are currently modest compared to our business in the United States, our international business could grow over time. We have evaluated the new regulation and its requirements, and believe we are currently in compliance with the GDPR in all material respects. Going forward, however, the expansion of our international operations could require us to change our business practices and may increase the costs and complexity of compliance. Also, a violation by the Company of the new regulation could expose us to penalties and sanctions under the regulation.\nOn June 28, 2018, California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), effective on January 1, 2020. The new law provides California consumers with a greater level of transparency and broader rights and choices with respect to their personal information than those contained in any existing state and federal laws in the U.S. The \u201cpersonal information\u201d regulated by CCPA is broadly defined to include identification or association with a California consumer or household, including demographics, usage, transactions and inquiries, preferences, inferences drawn to create a profile about a consumer, and education information. Compliance with CCPA requires the implementation of a series of operational measures such as preparing data maps, inventory, or other records of all personal information pertaining to California residents, households and devices, as well as information sources, usage, storage, and sharing, maintaining and updating detailed disclosures in privacy policies, establishing mechanisms (including, at a minimum, a toll-free telephone number and an online channel) to respond to consumers\u2019 data access, deletion, portability, and opt-out requests, providing a clear and conspicuous \u201cDo Not Sell My Personal Information\u201d link on the home page of the business\u2019 website, etc. CCPA prohibits businesses from discriminating against consumers who have opted out of the sale of their personal information, subject to a narrow exception. It allows companies to provide financial incentives to California consumers in order to obtain their consent to the collection and use of their personal information. Violations of CCPA will result in civil penalties up to $7,500 per violation. CCPA further allows consumers to file lawsuits against a business if a data breach has occurred and the California Attorney General does not prosecute the business.\nIn addition, on May 29, 2019, Nevada\u2019s governor approved a bill (the \u201cAmendment Bill\u201d), effective on October 1, 2019. The Amendment Bill provides amendments to an existing law that requires operators of websites and online services to post a notice on their websites regarding their privacy practices. The Amendment Bill requires operators of internet websites or online services to establish a designated request address through which a consumer may submit a verified request directing such operators not to make any sale of covered information collected about the consumer. The \u201ccovered information\u201d regulated by the Amendment Bill is defined to include an enumerated list of items of personally identifiable information (including names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers and identifiers that allow a specific person to be contacted).\nThe changes introduced by the CCPA and the Amendment Bill, and other similar regulations enacted by other jurisdictions, will subject the Company to additional costs and complexity of compliance, by requiring, among other things, changes to the Company\u2019s security systems, policies, procedures and practices. In addition, a violation by the Company of the new regulations could expose us to penalties and sanctions.\nOne or more states or municipalities could assert that the Company is liable for sales and use, commerce, or similar type of taxes, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe ship product to retail customers throughout the United States. In South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. et al (\"Wayfair\"), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states may charge tax on purchases made from out-of-state sellers, even if the seller does not have a physical presence in the taxing state. The effect of Wayfair was to uphold economic nexus principles in determining sales and use tax nexus. As a result of the decision, most states have adopted laws that require an out-of-state retailer to register and collect sales and use or other non-income type taxes upon meeting certain economic nexus standards regardless of whether the company has physical presence in the state. Although the Company believes it is complying with these new requirements, our interpretation and application of the newly enacted legislation may differ from the states, which could result in the states' attempt to impose additional tax liabilities, including potential penalties and interest. Furthermore, the requirements by state or local governments on out-of-state sellers to collect sales and use taxes could deter futures sales, which could have an impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFor other risks related to taxation, see \u201cGeneral Risk Factors- Changes in U.S. tax law could adversely affect our business and financial condition,\u201d below.\nWe use lead providers and marketing affiliates to assist us in obtaining new customers and, and if lead providers or marketing affiliates do not comply with an increasing number of applicable laws and regulations, or if our ability to use such lead providers or marketing affiliates is otherwise impaired, it could adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent on third parties, referred to as lead providers (or lead generators) and marketing affiliates, as a source of new customers for our Direct-to-Consumer segment and new borrowers for our Secured Lending segment. Our marketing affiliates place our advertisements on their websites that direct potential customers to our websites. Generally, lead providers operate, and also work with their own marketing affiliates who operate separate websites to attract prospective customers and then sell those \u201cleads\u201d to online traders and lenders. As a result, the success of our business depends substantially on the willingness and ability of lead providers or marketing affiliates to provide us customer leads at acceptable prices.\nIf regulatory oversight of lead providers or marketing affiliates is increased, through the implementation of new laws or regulations or the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, our ability to use lead providers or marketing affiliates could be restricted or eliminated. For example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) has indicated its intention to examine compliance with federal laws and regulations by lead providers and to scrutinize the flow of non-public, private borrower information between lead providers and lead buyers, such as us. Over the past few years, several states have taken actions that have caused us to discontinue the use of lead providers in those states. While these discontinuations did not have a material adverse effect on us, other states may propose or enact similar restrictions on lead providers and potentially on marketing affiliates in the future, and if other states adopt similar restrictions, our ability to use lead providers or marketing affiliates in those states would also be interrupted.\nThe failure by lead providers or marketing affiliates to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or any changes in laws or regulations applicable to lead providers or marketing affiliates or changes in the interpretation or implementation of such laws or regulations, could have an adverse effect on our business and could increase negative perceptions of our business and industry. Additionally, the use of lead providers and marketing affiliates could subject us to additional regulatory cost and expense. If our ability to use lead providers or marketing affiliates were to be impaired, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nJudicial decisions, CFPB rulemaking or amendments to the Federal Arbitration Act could render the arbitration agreements we use illegal or unenforceable.\nWe include arbitration provisions in our loan and financing agreements. These provisions are designed to allow us to resolve any customer disputes through individual arbitration rather than in court and explicitly provide that all arbitrations will be conducted on an individual and not on a class basis. Thus, our arbitration agreements, if enforced, have the effect of shielding us from class action liability. Our arbitration agreements do not generally have any impact on regulatory enforcement proceedings. We take the position that the arbitration provisions in loan and financing agreements, including class action waivers, are valid and enforceable; however, the enforceability of arbitration provisions is often challenged in court. If those challenges are successful, our arbitration and class action waiver provisions could be unenforceable, which could subject us to additional litigation, including additional class action litigation.\nIn addition, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would generally limit or prohibit mandatory arbitration agreements in consumer contracts and has enacted legislation with such a prohibition with respect to certain mortgage loan agreements and also certain consumer loan agreements to members of the military on active duty and their dependents. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act directed the CFPB to study consumer arbitration and authorized the CFPB to adopt rules limiting or prohibiting consumer arbitration, consistent with the results of its study. In July 2017, the CFPB issued a new rule on arbitration, which would have prohibited class action waivers in certain consumer financial services contracts. However, in November 2017, President Trump signed a joint resolution passed by Congress disapproving the rule under the Congressional Review Act. Because the rule was disapproved, it cannot be reissued in substantially the same form, and the CFPB cannot issue a substantially similar rule unless the new rule is specifically authorized by a law enacted after the date of the joint resolution disapproving the original rule.\nAny judicial decisions, legislation or other rules or regulations that impair our ability to enter into and enforce consumer arbitration agreements and class action waivers will increase our exposure to class action litigation as well as litigation in plaintiff-friendly jurisdictions, which would be costly and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur advertising and marketing materials and disclosures have been and continue to be subject to regulatory scrutiny.\nIn the jurisdictions where we operate, our advertising and marketing activities and disclosures are subject to regulation under various industry standards, borrower protection laws, and other applicable laws and regulations. Consistent with the lending industry as a whole, our advertising and marketing materials have come under increased scrutiny.\nGoing forward, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to advertise and market our business units in a manner we consider effective. Any inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nWe are not currently paying regular dividends and may not pay any dividends in the future.\nThe Company suspended its regular dividend policy in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. The declaration of cash dividends is subject to the determination each quarter by the Board of Directors, based on its assessment of a number of factors, including the Company\u2019s financial performance, available cash resources, cash requirements, bank covenants, and alternative uses of cash that the Board of Directors may conclude would represent an opportunity to generate a greater return on investment for the Company.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will resume paying dividends on a regular basis. If the Board of Directors were to determine not to pay dividends in the future, shareholders would not receive any further return on an investment in our capital stock in the form of dividends and may obtain an economic benefit from the common stock only after an increase in its trading price and only by selling the common stock.\nYour percentage ownership in the Company could be diluted in the future.\nYour percentage ownership in A-Mark potentially could be diluted in the future because of additional equity awards that we expect will be granted to our directors, officers and employees. We have established an equity incentive plan that provides for the grant of common stock-based equity awards to our directors, officers and other employees. In addition, we may issue equity in order to raise capital or in connection with future acquisitions and strategic investments, which could dilute your percentage ownership. For example, in the acquisition of JMB, we issued stock to the former owners of the company in partial consideration for their interests.\nProvisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and of Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the Company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain certain anti-takeover provisions that could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of the Company without negotiating with our board of directors. Such provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for the Company\u2019s securities. Certain of such provisions allow the Company to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock, impose various procedural and other requirements which could make it more difficult for Shareholders to effect certain corporate actions and set forth rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings.\nWe believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. However, these provisions apply even if an acquisition offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of our Company and our Shareholders. Accordingly, in the event that our board determines that a potential business combination transaction is not in the best interests of our Company and our Shareholders, but certain shareholders believe that such a transaction would be beneficial to the Company and its Shareholders, such Shareholders may elect to sell their shares in the Company and the trading price of our common stock could decrease.\nOur board and management beneficially own a sizeable percentage of our common stock and therefore have the ability to exert substantial influence as shareholders.\nMembers of our board and management beneficially own approximately 26% of our outstanding common stock. Acting together in their capacity as shareholders, the board members and management could exert substantial influence over matters on which a shareholder vote is required, such as the approval of business combination transactions. Also because of the size of their beneficial ownership, the board members and management may be in a position effectively to determine the outcome of the election of directors\nand the vote on shareholder proposals. The concentration of beneficial ownership in the hands of our board and management may therefore limit the ability of our public shareholders to influence the affairs of the Company.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nUncertainty about the future of LIBOR may adversely affect our business.\nBorrowings under our revolving credit agreement bear interest at rates that are calculated based on LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calibration of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR in its current form cannot be assured after 2021. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. In the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the \u201cARRC\u201d) has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as an alternative to LIBOR for use in contracts that are currently indexed to United States dollar LIBOR and has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR. It is not presently known whether SOFR or any other alternative reference rates that have been proposed will attain market acceptance as replacements of LIBOR.\nOn November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration announced a consultation on its intention to cease the publication of certain LIBOR rates, including its intention to cease the publication of the three-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR on June 30, 2023. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d) also announced its proposed approach to ensure an orderly wind-down of LIBOR. It has supported publication of three-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR tenor in a representative manner through June 30, 2023, although legislation has been introduced that would allow the FCA to accelerate the transition. The U.S. Federal Reserve, Office of Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Company also issued a statement encouraging banks to cease entering into new contracts that use U.S. Dollar LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021.\nThe Company utilizes its Trading Credit Facility to purchase and finance precious metals and for operating cash flow purposes. The Trading Credit Facility includes contingency provisions for the discontinuation of LIBOR. Under these provisions, the Trading Credit Facility first looks to a replacement based on the SOFR, but if such replacement cannot be determined, Company and the administrative agent for the facility jointly select an alternative benchmark rate, giving due consideration to recommendations of replacement rates by governmental bodies and prevailing market conventions. Although alternative reference rates have been proposed, it is unknown whether these alternative reference rates will attain market acceptance as replacements of LIBOR.\nIf, as currently anticipated, LIBOR is replaced by alternative rates, the method and rate used to calculate our variable-rate debt in the future, particularly under our Trading Credit Facility, may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher than, lower than, or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the interest rates and/or payments that would have been made on our obligations if LIBOR was available in its current form. Because arrangements for the anticipated replacement of LIBOR have not yet been finalized, the potential effect of the replacement of LIBOR on our cost of capital, financial results, and cash flows cannot yet be determined.\nIf our customer data were breached, we could suffer damages and loss of reputation.\nBy the nature of our business, we maintain significant amounts of customer data on our systems. Moreover, certain third party providers have access to confidential data concerning the Company in the ordinary course of their business relationships with the Company. In recent years, various companies, including companies that are significantly larger than us, have reported breaches of their computer systems that have resulted in the compromise of customer data. Any compromise or breach of customer or company data held or maintained by either the Company or our third party providers could significantly damage our reputation and result in costs, lost trades, fines and lawsuits. The regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. There is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches.\nThe Company\u2019s failure or inability to protect its intellectual property could harm its competitive position.\nThe Company relies on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements and licenses, to establish and protect its rights in its business, services, know-how and information. The Company may apply for additional patents in the future, but there can be no assurance that any such applications will be granted, and if granted may not protect its technology. The Company\u2019s patent, trademarks or service marks may be challenged and found by a court to be invalid or unenforceable. Even if its registrations are upheld or are not challenged, the costs of enforcing intellectual property rights can be material.\nThe Company generally enters into confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants and other third parties to control and limit access to, and disclosure of, its confidential information. These contractual arrangements or other steps taken to protect its intellectual property may not prove to be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of technology or deter independent third-party development of similar technologies.\nIf the Company were unable to protect or enforce its intellectual property rights, its competitive position would suffer.\nThird parties may assert violations of their intellectual property rights against the Company.\nThird parties may currently have, or may eventually be issued, patents upon which the technologies used by the Company infringe, subjecting the Company to claims for infringement. The Company could incur significant costs and diversion of management time and resources to defend such claims, regardless of their validity. The Company could suffer development delays, be required to develop non-infringing technology at considerable cost and expense or be compelled to enter into royalty or license agreements, which might not be available on economically acceptable terms, or at all. For example, JMB was compelled to expend significant resources as a consequence of litigation in which it was accused of infringement prior to its acquisition by the Company.\nWe are subject to other laws and regulations.\nIn addition to the specific matters discussed above, we are subject to various laws, litigation, regulatory matters and ethical standards, and our failure to comply with or adequately address developments as they arise could adversely affect our reputation and operations. Our policies, procedures and practices and the technology we implement are designed to comply with federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations, including those imposed by the SEC and other regulatory agencies, the marketplace, the banking industry and foreign countries, as well as responsible business, social and environmental practices, all of which may change from time to time. Significant legislative changes, including those that relate to employment matters and health care reform, could impact our relationship with our workforce, which could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations. In addition, if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or implement responsible business, social and environmental practices, we could be subject to damage to our reputation, class action lawsuits, legal and settlement costs, civil and criminal liability, increased cost of regulatory compliance, restatements of our financial statements, disruption of our business and loss of customers. Any required changes to our employment practices could result in the loss of employees, reduced sales, increased employment costs, low employee morale and harm to our business and results of operations. We are also regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nChanges in U.S. tax law could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe laws, rules, and regulations dealing with U.S. federal, state, and local income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect us or holders of our common stock. In recent years, many changes have been made to applicable tax laws and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. It cannot be predicted whether, when, in what form, or with what effective dates, new tax laws may be enacted, or regulations and rulings may be enacted, promulgated or issued under existing or new tax laws, which could result in an increase in our tax liability or require changes in the manner in which we operate in order to minimize or mitigate any adverse effects of changes in tax law or in the interpretation thereof.", "PERMNO": 14532, "SIC": 5051, "TIC": "AMRK"}
