RISK FACTORS\nOur concentration in non-owner occupied real estate loans may expose us to increased credit risk.\nAt December 31, 2014, $36.2 million, or 40.6% of our residential mortgage loan portfolio and 14.9% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of loans secured by non-owner occupied residential properties. Loans secured by non-owner occupied properties generally expose us to greater risk of non-payment and loss than loans secured by owner occupied properties because the repayment of such loans depends primarily on the tenant\u2019s continuing ability to pay rent to the property owner, who is our borrower, or, if the property owner is unable to find a tenant, the property owner\u2019s ability to repay the loan without the benefit of a rental income stream. In addition, the physical condition of non-owner occupied properties is often below that of owner occupied properties due to lax property maintenance standards, which has a negative impact on the value of the collateral properties. Furthermore, some of our non-owner occupied residential loan borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one credit relationship may expose us to a greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to an owner occupied residential mortgage loan. At December 31, 2014, non-performing non-owner occupied residential mortgage loans totaled $202,000, or 0.56% of our non-owner occupied residential loan portfolio, of which all was attributable to three borrowers. For more information about the credit risk we face, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management.\u201d\nOur construction loan and land and land development loan portfolios may expose us to increased credit risk.\nAt December 31, 2014, $27.3 million, or 11.2% of our loan portfolio, consisted of construction loans and land and land development loans, and $1.6 million, or 5.8% of the construction loan and land and land development portfolio, consisted of speculative construction loans. While recently the demand for construction loans has decreased significantly due to the decline in the housing market, historically, construction loans, including speculative construction loans, have been a material part of our loan portfolio. Speculative construction loans are loans made to builders who have not identified a buyer for the completed property at the time of loan origination. Subject to market conditions, we intend to continue to emphasize the origination of construction loans and land and land development loans. These loan types generally expose a lender to greater risk of nonpayment and loss than residential mortgage loans because the repayment of such loans often depends on the successful operation or sale of the property and the income stream of the borrowers and such loans typically involve larger balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers. In addition, many borrowers of these types of loans have more than one loan outstanding with us so an adverse development with respect to one loan or credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of non-payment and loss. Furthermore, we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses through future charges to income as the portfolio of these types of loans grows, which would decrease our earnings. For more information about the credit risk we face, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Risk Management.\u201d\nOur consumer loan portfolio includes consumer loans secured by rapidly depreciable assets and may expose us to increased credit risk.\nAt December 31, 2014, $24.7 million, or 10.2% of our loan portfolio, consisted of consumer loans. Included in consumer loans at that date were $6.1 million in automobile loans and $2.1 million in consumer finance loans made to borrowers by our operating subsidiary, Southland Finance, Inc. These consumer finance loans are generally secured by used automobiles, televisions and various other personal property and are generally offered to borrowers with historically lower credit scores at higher risk-adjusted interest rates. At December 31, 2014, Southland Finance, Inc.\u2019s average outstanding loan balance was approximately $3,900 and the weighted-average yield of its loan portfolio was 25.88%. Consumer loans secured by rapidly depreciable assets such as automobiles and other personal property may be subject to greater risk of loss than loans secured by real estate because any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance.\nSignificant loan losses could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses through a charge to earnings.\nWhen we loan money we incur the risk that our borrowers will not repay their loans. We provide for loan losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial condition and results of operations. It requires subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. We might underestimate the loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio and have loan losses in excess of the amount recorded in our allowance for loan losses. We might increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions. For example, in a rising interest rate environment, borrowers with adjustable-rate loans could see their payments increase. There may be a significant increase in the number of borrowers who are unable or unwilling to repay their loans, resulting in our charging off more loans and increasing our allowance. In addition, when real estate values decline, the potential severity of loss on a real estate-secured loan can increase significantly, especially in the case of loans with high combined loan-to-value ratios. The recent decline in the national economy and the local economies of the areas in which the loans are concentrated could result in an increase in loan delinquencies, foreclosures or repossessions resulting in increased charge-off amounts and the need for additional loan loss allowances in future periods. In addition, our determination as to the amount of our allowance for loan losses is subject to review by our primary regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as part of its examination process, which may result in the establishment of an additional allowance based upon the judgment of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency after a review of the information available at the time of its examination. Our allowance for loan losses amounted to $3.9 million, or 1.61% of total loans outstanding and 179.34% of non-performing loans, at December 31, 2014. Our allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2014 may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses. A large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, which would decrease our earnings.\nIn addition, at December 31, 2014, we had 45 loan relationships with outstanding balances that exceeded $1.0 million. Two loans in this group were classified as substandard as of December 31, 2014: (1) a $1.7 million commercial business loan secured by assets of radio stations located in East Tennessee, (2) a $107,000 land loan, which is a 58.8% participation interest, secured by farmland located in Friendsville, Tennessee. A contract for sale of this property is pending and anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2015. The further deterioration of one or more of these large relationship loans could result in a significant increase in our non-performing loans and our provision for loan losses, which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nA return to recessionary conditions could result in increases in our level of non-performing loans and/or reduce demand for our products and services, which would lead to lower revenue, higher loan losses and lower earnings.\nThe recession, that officially lasted until June 2009 although the effects have continued thereafter, led to dramatic declines in real estate values and high levels of foreclosures, resulting in significant asset write-downs by financial institutions, which led many financial institutions to seek additional capital, to merge with other institutions and, in some cases, to fail. A return of recessionary conditions and/or continued negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Further declines in real estate values\nand sales volumes and continued high unemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies, increases in our levels of nonperforming and classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services. These negative events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital, liquidity, and financial condition.\nChanging interest rates may decrease our earnings and asset value.\nOur net interest income is the interest we earn on loans and investments less the interest we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Our net interest margin is the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and our other sources of funding. Changes in interest rates-up or down-could adversely affect our net interest margin and, as a result, our net interest income. Although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest margin to expand or contract. Our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets, so they may adjust faster in response to changes in interest rates. As a result, when interest rates rise, our funding costs may rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets, causing our net interest margin to contract until the yield catches up. This contraction could be more severe following a prolonged period of lower interest rates, as a larger proportion of our fixed rate residential loan portfolio will have been originated at those lower rates and borrowers may be more reluctant or unable to sell their homes in a higher interest rate environment. Changes in the slope of the \u201cyield curve\u201d-or the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates-could also reduce our net interest margin. Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term rates are lower than long-term rates. Because our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets, when the yield curve flattens or even inverts, we could experience pressure on our net interest margin as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can earn on our assets. For further discussion of how changes in interest rates could impact us, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -Risk Management - Interest Rate Risk Management.\u201d\nStrong competition within our primary market area could negatively impact our profits and slow growth.\nWe face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. This competition has made it more difficult for us to make new loans and attract deposits. Price competition for loans and deposits might result in us earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits, which would reduce net interest income. Competition also makes it more difficult to grow loans and deposits. At June 30, 2014, which is the most recent date for which data is available from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, we held approximately 24.1% of the FDIC-insured deposits in McMinn County, Tennessee, 3.9% of the FDIC-insured deposits in Monroe County, Tennessee, and 2.0% of the FDIC-insured deposits in Bradley County, Tennessee. Some of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our primary market area. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Market Area\u201d and \u201cItem 1. Business - Competition\u201d for more information.\nWe are subject to federal regulations that seek to protect the Deposit Insurance Fund and the depositors and borrowers of the Bank, and our federal regulators may impose restrictions on our operations that are detrimental to holders of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, our primary federal regulators, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as insurer of our deposits. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage, and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of the Bank rather than for holders of the Company\u2019s common stock. Our regulators may subject us to supervisory and enforcement actions, such as the imposition of certain restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and the determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses, that are aimed at protecting the insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of the Bank but that are detrimental to holders of the Company\u2019s common stock. Any change in our regulation or oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations.\nRisks associated with system failures, interruptions, or breaches of security could negatively affect our earnings and business reputation.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities investments, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches (including privacy breaches), but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition, any compromise of our systems could deter customers from using our products and services. Although we rely on security systems to provide security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of security.\nIn addition, we outsource a majority of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any system failures, interruption, or breach of security could damage our business reputation and result in a loss of customers and business thereby subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and our business reputation.", "PERMNO": 93224, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "AFCB"}
