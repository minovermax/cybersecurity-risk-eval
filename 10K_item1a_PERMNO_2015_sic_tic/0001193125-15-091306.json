{"cik": "1488613", "company": "Foundation Medicine, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following risks and uncertainties, together with all other information in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, should be considered carefully. Any of the risk factors we describe below could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, and could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate or decline.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Strategy\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient revenue from FoundationOne, FoundationOne Heme, or our relationships with our biopharmaceutical partners to achieve and maintain profitability.\nWe believe our commercial success is dependent upon our ability to successfully market and sell our first molecular information products, FoundationOne for solid tumors and FoundationOne Heme for blood-based cancers, or hematologic malignancies, to physicians in clinical practice, to continue to expand our current relationships and develop new relationships with biopharmaceutical partners, and to develop and commercialize\nnew molecular information products. The demand for FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme may decrease or may not continue to increase at historical rates for a number of reasons. In addition, FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme only have one coverage decision from a commercial third-party payor and do not yet have coverage contracts with or coverage decisions from other commercial third-party payors or government payors, including Medicare. Certain other commercial third-party payors have declined to reimburse FoundationOne or FoundationOne Heme because they have designated our products as experimental and investigational. The experimental and investigational designation is customarily assigned to a product or service by a third-party payor pending the development of clinical information deemed sufficient by a third-party-payor to support a positive coverage decision. During this assessment period our products do not have the benefit of a positive coverage decision or a coverage contract from these third-party payors, resulting, in the aggregate, in a material loss of revenue to us. We have experienced early revenue growth from the sale of each of FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme to physicians, principally since their formal commercial launches in June 2012 and December 2013, respectively. We may not be able to continue revenue growth or maintain existing revenue levels.\nOur biopharmaceutical partners may decide to decrease or discontinue their use of our molecular information platform due to changes in research and product development plans, failures in their clinical trials, financial constraints, or utilization of internal molecular testing resources or molecular tests performed by other parties, which are circumstances outside of our control. In addition to reducing our revenue, this may reduce our exposure to early stage research that facilitates the incorporation of newly developed information about cancer into our molecular information platform, FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme.\nWe are currently not profitable. Even if we succeed in increasing adoption of FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme by physicians, obtaining additional coverage decisions from commercial third-party and government payors, maintaining and creating relationships with our existing and new biopharmaceutical partners and developing and commercializing additional molecular information products, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability.\nFoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme may never achieve significant commercial market acceptance.\nFoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme may never gain significant acceptance in the marketplace and, therefore, may never generate substantial revenue or profits for us. Our ability to achieve commercial market acceptance for FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme will depend on several factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to convince the medical community of the clinical utility of our products and their potential advantages over existing molecular tests;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of physicians and patients to utilize our products; and\n\u2022\nthe agreement by commercial third-party payors and government payors to reimburse our products, the scope and amount of which will affect patients\u2019 willingness or ability to pay for our products and likely heavily influence physicians\u2019 decisions to recommend our products.\nIn addition, physicians may rely on guidelines issued by industry groups, such as the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, medical societies, such as the College of American Pathologists, or other key oncology-related organizations before utilizing any diagnostic test. Although we have a number of company-sponsored clinical trials and clinical trials sponsored by individual physicians, or investigator-initiated clinical trials, underway to demonstrate the clinical utility of each of FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme, they are not yet, and may never be, listed in any such guidelines.\nWe believe that the successful completion of clinical trials, publication of scientific and medical results in peer-reviewed journals, and presentations at leading conferences are critical to the broad adoption of FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme. Publication in leading medical journals is subject to a peer-review process, and peer reviewers may not consider the results of studies involving FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme sufficiently novel or worthy of publication.\nThe failure to be listed in physician guidelines or the failure of our trials to produce favorable results or to be published in peer-reviewed journals could limit the adoption of our products. Failure to achieve widespread market acceptance of FoundationOne or FoundationOne Heme would materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers or, in some cases, sole suppliers, for some of our laboratory instruments and materials and may not be able to find replacements or immediately transition to alternative suppliers.\nWe rely on several sole suppliers, including Illumina, for certain laboratory substances used in the chemical reactions incorporated into our processes, or reagents, sequencers, equipment, and other materials which we use in our laboratory operations. An interruption in our laboratory operations could occur if we encounter delays or difficulties in securing these reagents, sequencers, or other laboratory materials, and if we cannot then obtain an acceptable substitute. Any such interruption could significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation. We rely on Illumina as the sole supplier of the sequencers and various associated reagents, and as the sole provider of maintenance and repair services for these sequencers. Any disruption in Illumina\u2019s operations could impact our supply chain and laboratory operations of our molecular information platform and our ability to conduct our business and generate revenue.\nWe believe that there are only a few other equipment manufacturers that are currently capable of supplying and servicing the equipment necessary for our laboratory operations, including sequencers and various associated reagents. The use of equipment or materials furnished by these replacement suppliers would require us to alter our laboratory operations. Transitioning to a new supplier would be time consuming and expensive, may result in interruptions in our laboratory operations, would likely affect the performance specifications of our laboratory operations, and would require that we revalidate FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure alternative equipment, reagents, and other materials, and bring such equipment, reagents, and materials on line and revalidate them without experiencing interruptions in our workflow. In the case of an alternative supplier for Illumina, there can be no assurance that replacement sequencers and various associated reagents will be available or will meet our quality control and performance requirements for our laboratory operations. If we should encounter delays or difficulties in securing, reconfiguring, or revalidating the equipment and reagents we require for our products, our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected.\nIf our sole laboratory facility becomes damaged or inoperable, if we are required to vacate our laboratory facility, or if our construction of additional laboratory space in our headquarters is delayed or never completed, our ability to conduct our genomic analyses and pursue our research and development efforts or our companion diagnostics partnerships may be jeopardized.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from tests conducted at a single laboratory facility located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Our facility and equipment could be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including war, fire, earthquake, power loss, communications failure, or terrorism, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to operate our molecular information platform for some period of time. The inability to perform our molecular tests or to reduce the backlog of analyses that could develop if our facility is inoperable, for even a short period of time, may result in the loss of customers or harm to our reputation, and we may be unable to regain those customers or repair our reputation in the future. Furthermore, our facility and the equipment we use to perform our research and development work could be unavailable or costly and time-consuming to repair or replace. It would be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to rebuild our facility or license or transfer our proprietary technology to a third-party, particularly in light of the licensure and accreditation requirements for a commercial laboratory like ours. Even in the unlikely event we are able to find a third party with such qualifications to enable us to conduct our molecular tests, we may be unable to negotiate commercially reasonable terms.\nWe are building additional laboratory space at our corporate headquarters to support our development of companion diagnostic tests and new product development, including the development of a circulating tumor\nDNA assay. If we are delayed in building the new laboratory for companion diagnostic tests, or if we never complete construction and validation, this delay could result in our inability to meet agreed upon timelines with certain of our biopharmaceutical partners, which could cause us to breach our agreement or result in harm to our business and reputation. In addition, if we are delayed in building additional laboratory space for new product development, or if we never complete construction and validation, this delay could impact our ability to develop and launch new products such as a circulating tumor DNA assay, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe carry insurance for damage to our property and laboratory and the disruption of our business, but this insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with damage or disruption to our business, may not provide coverage in amounts sufficient to cover our potential losses, and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIf we are unable to support demand for FoundationOne, FoundationOne Heme and our future products, including ensuring that we have adequate capacity to meet increased demand, or we are unable to successfully manage the evolution of our molecular information platform, our business could suffer.\nAs our volume grows, we will need to continue to increase our workflow capacity for sample intake, customer service, billing and general process improvements, expand our internal quality assurance program, and extend our platform to support comprehensive genomic analyses at a larger scale within expected turnaround times. We will need additional certified laboratory scientists and other scientific and technical personnel to process higher volumes of our molecular information products. Portions of our process are not automated and will require additional personnel to scale. We will also need to purchase additional equipment, some of which can take several months or more to procure, setup, and validate, and increase our software and computing capacity to meet increased demand. There is no assurance that any of these increases in scale, expansion of personnel, equipment, software and computing capacities, or process enhancements will be successfully implemented, or that we will have adequate space in our laboratory facility to accommodate such required expansion.\nAs additional products are commercialized, we will need to incorporate new equipment, implement new technology systems and laboratory processes, and hire new personnel with different qualifications. For example, we are building additional laboratory space to allow us to further develop our circulating tumor DNA assay product. Failure to manage this growth or transition could result in turnaround time delays, higher product costs, declining product quality, deteriorating customer service, and slower responses to competitive challenges. A failure in any one of these areas could make it difficult for us to meet market expectations for our products, and could damage our reputation and the prospects for our business.\nNew product development involves a lengthy and complex process, and we may be unable to successfully commercialize FoundationOne Heme or any other products we may develop on a timely basis, or at all.\nFoundationOne Heme, which we launched in December 2013 for hematologic cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma, as well as pediatric cancers and many sarcomas, will take time to successfully commercialize. There can be no assurance that FoundationOne Heme will be successful in the evaluation of blood-based cancers for a variety of technical and market reasons. Our other new molecular information products, including a circulating tumor DNA assay, which are in various stages of early development, will take time to develop and commercialize, if we are able to commercialize them at all. There can be no assurance that our new products will be capable of reliably identifying relevant genomic alterations in various forms of cancer. Before we can commercialize any new products, we will need to expend significant funds in order to:\n\u2022\nconduct substantial research and development, including validation studies and potentially clinical trials;\n\u2022\nbuild additional laboratory space for new products, including a circulating tumor DNA assay;\n\u2022\nfurther develop and scale our laboratory processes to accommodate different products; and\n\u2022\nfurther develop and scale our infrastructure to be able to analyze increasingly large amounts of data.\nOur product development process involves a high degree of risk, and product development efforts may fail for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nfailure of the product to perform as expected at the research or development stage;\n\u2022\nlack of validation data; or\n\u2022\nfailure to demonstrate the clinical utility of the product.\nAs we develop products, we will have to make significant investments in product development, marketing, and selling resources. In addition, competitors may develop and commercialize competing products faster than we are able to do so.\nIf we cannot compete successfully with our competitors, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenue or achieve and sustain profitability.\nPersonalized genomic diagnostics is a new area of science, and we face competition from companies that offer products or have conducted research to profile genes and gene expression in various cancers. Our principal competition comes from diagnostic companies that offer molecular diagnostic tests that capture only a single-marker or test panels that capture a limited number of the most well-known gene alterations, which are also known as hotspot panel tests. In addition, academic research centers, diagnostic companies and NGS platform developers are offering or developing NGS-based testing.\nOur competitors include laboratory companies such as Bio-Reference Laboratories, Inc., Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, Molecular Health, Caris Life Sciences, Guardant Health, Paradigm, NeoGenomics Laboratories, as well as companies such as Abbott Laboratories, Qiagen N.V., and Sequenom, Inc. that manufacture or may manufacture diagnostic testing kits. In addition, companies such as Genomic Health, Inc. and Myriad Genetics, Inc. have well-established commercial organizations that sell molecular diagnostic tests for cancer to physicians and may develop tests which compete with FoundationOne or FoundationOne Heme.\nMany hospitals and academic medical centers may also seek to perform the type of molecular testing we perform at their own facilities. As such, our competition may include entities such as the MD Anderson Cancer Center, MSKCC, University of Michigan, Baylor Medical Genetics Laboratories, Washington University in St. Louis, University of Washington, and other academic hospitals and research centers.\nIn addition, Illumina, Thermo Fisher, and other companies market NGS platforms that are being sold directly to research centers, biopharmaceutical companies, and clinical laboratories. While these platforms have been largely utilized in research and development settings or testing for non-cancer conditions, each of these companies has launched and will likely continue to commercialize products for focused application in the clinical oncology market. We believe diagnostic platform providers will seek to place sequencing machines in laboratories and to develop NGS-based laboratory-developed tests, or LDTs, for use in clinical oncology, including by seeking to decrease the cost, size, and complexity of their platforms. In addition, Illumina has received FDA-approval for a diagnostic kit for clinical use outside of oncology which is sold to clients who have purchased its platforms. We believe Illumina and other diagnostic platform providers may develop additional FDA-approved diagnostic kits for clinical use by clients who have purchased their platforms, potentially including for these clients to identify genetic alternations in samples of solid tumors or blood-based cancers. Also, many private companies are developing information technology-based tools to support the integration of NGS testing into the clinical setting. The successful development and marketing of these products by diagnostic platform providers could enable some of our potential customers to perform clinical-grade, comprehensive genomic analysis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. These companies may also use their patent portfolios, developed in connection with developing their tests, to allege that\nFoundationOne or FoundationOne Heme infringes their patents, and we could face litigation with respect to such allegations and the validity of such patents.\nIn addition, because our proprietary molecular information platform consists largely of trade-secret protected technology and know-how and has only limited patent protection, new and existing companies could seek to develop molecular tests that compete with ours. These competitors could have technological, financial, and market access advantages that are not currently available to us.\nThe molecular diagnostic industry is subject to rapidly changing technology which could make our molecular information platform, FoundationOne, FoundationOne Heme, and other products we develop obsolete.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards, all of which could make our molecular information platform, FoundationOne, FoundationOne Heme, and the other molecular information products we are developing obsolete. Our future success will depend on our ability to keep pace with the evolving needs of our customers on a timely and cost-effective basis and to pursue new market opportunities that develop as a result of technological and scientific advances. In recent years, there have been numerous advances in technologies relating to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. There have also been advances in methods used to analyze very large amounts of genomic information. We must continuously enhance our molecular information platform and develop new products to keep pace with evolving standards of care. If we do not update our molecular information platform to reflect new scientific knowledge about cancer biology, information about new cancer therapies, or relevant clinical trials, our molecular information platform could become obsolete and sales of FoundationOne, FoundationOne Heme, and any new products could decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf our products do not perform as expected, our operating results, reputation, and business will suffer.\nOur success depends on the market\u2019s confidence that we can provide reliable, high-quality molecular information products. There is no guarantee that the accuracy and reproducibility we have demonstrated to date will continue, particularly for clinical samples, as our test volume increases. We believe that our customers are likely to be particularly sensitive to product defects and errors, including if our products fail to detect genomic alterations with high accuracy from clinical specimens or if we fail to list, or inaccurately include, certain treatment options and available clinical trials in our test report. As a result, the failure of our products to perform as expected would significantly impair our operating results and our reputation. We may be subject to legal claims arising from any defects or errors.\nWe refer to the efficiency of our sequencing process as its yield. The sequencing process yields that we achieve depend on the design and operation of our sequencing process, which uses a number of complex and sophisticated biochemical, informatics, optical, and mechanical processes, many of which are highly sensitive to external factors. An operational or technological failure in one of these complex processes or fluctuations in external variables may result in sequencing processing yields that are lower than we anticipate or that vary between sequencing runs. In addition, we are regularly evaluating and refining our sequencing process. These refinements may initially result in unanticipated issues that further reduce our sequencing process yields or increase the variability of our sequencing process yields. Low sequencing process yields, or higher than anticipated variability, referring to yields of variability, increase total sequencing costs and reduce the number of samples we can sequence in a given time period, which can cause variability in our operating results and damage our reputation.\nIn addition, our FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme reports match identified genomic alterations with FDA-approved targeted therapies or relevant clinical trials of targeted therapies. If a patient or clinical physician who orders FoundationOne or FoundationOne Heme is unable to obtain, or be reimbursed for the use of, targeted therapies because they are not indicated in the FDA-approved product label for treatment of a patient\u2019s cancer,\nthe patient is unable to enroll in an identified clinical trial due to the enrollment criteria of the trial, or some other reason, the patient or ordering clinical physician may conclude the FoundationOne or FoundationOne Heme report does not contain actionable information. If physicians do not believe FoundationOne or FoundationOne Heme consistently generates actionable information about their patients\u2019 cancers, they may be less likely to order our products in the future, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and results of operations could suffer.\nIf we lose the support of key thought leaders, it may be difficult to establish products enabled by our molecular information platform as a standard of care for patients with cancer, which may limit our revenue growth and ability to achieve profitability.\nWe have established relationships with leading oncology thought leaders at premier cancer institutions and oncology networks such as the MSKCC, the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, and the Taussig Cancer Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. If these key thought leaders determine that our molecular information platform, FoundationOne, FoundationOne Heme, or other products that we develop are not clinically effective, that alternative technologies are more effective, or if they elect to use internally developed products, we would encounter significant difficulty validating our testing platform, driving adoption, or establishing our molecular information platform, FoundationOne, and FoundationOne Heme as a standard of care, which would limit our revenue growth and our ability to achieve profitability.\nIf we cannot maintain our current relationships, or enter into new relationships, with biopharmaceutical companies, our product development could be delayed.\nWe deploy our molecular information platform to analyze tissue samples provided by biopharmaceutical partners from their clinical trials. We have entered into agreements with biopharmaceutical companies in the cancer field including, for example, Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Array BioPharma Inc., AstraZeneca UK Limited, Celgene Corporation, Clovis Oncology, Inc., Eisai Co., Ltd., Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, and Sanofi, among others. In each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, our alliance with Novartis accounted for more than 10% of our revenue. The revenue attributable to Novartis may also fluctuate in the future, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the termination of this relationship could result in a temporary or permanent loss of revenue to us.\nOur success in the future depends in part on our ability to maintain these relationships and to enter into new relationships. This can be difficult due to several factors, including internal and external constraints placed on these organizations, including Novartis, that can limit the number and type of relationships with companies like us that can be considered and consummated; the agreements governing our relationships are generally terminable at will by our biopharmaceutical customers; our biopharmaceutical customers, including Novartis, may be dissatisfied with our products; and continued usage of our products among particular biopharmaceutical customers, including Novartis, may depend on whether the partner obtains positive data in its clinical trials or other administrative factors that are outside our control. Additionally, some of our biopharmaceutical partners have contracted with us to provide testing for large numbers of samples, which could strain our testing capacity and restrict our ability to perform additional tests for other customers. If we fail to maintain these relationships, or enter into new ones, our business could suffer.\nIn addition, certain biopharmaceutical companies, including those with which we currently have agreements, may choose not to do business with us if our proposed transactions with Roche are consummated, particularly if they are competitors with Roche. If we are unable to continue to grow our business with biopharmaceutical companies, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nFrom time to time, we expect to engage in discussions with biopharmaceutical companies regarding commercial opportunities. There is no assurance that any of these discussions will result in a commercial\nagreement, or if an agreement is reached, that the resulting engagement will be successful or that clinical studies conducted as part of the engagement will produce successful outcomes. Speculation in the industry about our existing or potential engagements with biopharmaceutical companies can be a catalyst for adverse speculation about us, our products, and our technology, which can result in harm to our reputation and our business.\nWe may be unable to manage our future growth effectively, which could make it difficult to execute our business strategy.\nWe anticipate growth in our business operations, including the addition of laboratory space. This future growth could create strain on our organizational, administrative, and operational infrastructure, including laboratory operations, quality control, customer service, and sales force management. We may not be able to maintain the quality or expected turnaround times of our products or satisfy customer demand as it grows. Our ability to manage our growth properly will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial, and managerial controls, as well as our reporting systems and procedures. We plan to implement new enterprise software systems in a number of areas affecting a broad range of business processes and functional areas. The time and resources required to implement these new systems is uncertain, and failure to complete this in a timely and efficient manner could adversely affect our operations.\nWe have limited experience in marketing and selling our products, and if we are unable to expand our direct sales and marketing force to adequately address our customers\u2019 needs, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe have limited experience in marketing and selling FoundationOne, which had its formal commercial launch in June 2012, and FoundationOne Heme, which launched in December 2013. We may not be able to market, sell, or distribute FoundationOne, FoundationOne Heme, or other products we may develop effectively enough to support our planned growth. We sell our products in the United States through our own sales force and outside the United States with the assistance of distribution partners.\nOur future sales in the United States will depend in large part on our ability to develop, and substantially expand, our sales force and to increase the scope of our marketing efforts. Our target market of physicians is a large and diverse market. As a result, we believe it is necessary to develop a sales force that includes sales representatives with specific technical backgrounds. We will also need to attract and develop marketing personnel with industry expertise. Competition for such employees is intense. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel or be able to build an efficient and effective sales and marketing force, which could negatively impact sales and market acceptance of our products and limit our revenue growth and potential profitability.\nOur expected future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, and integrate additional employees. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our products and to compete effectively will depend in part on our ability to manage this potential future growth effectively, without compromising quality.\nOutside the United States, we enlist distribution partners and in one instance, a local laboratory, to assist with sales, distribution, and customer support. Locating, qualifying, and engaging distribution partners and local laboratories with local industry experience and knowledge will be necessary to effectively market and sell our products outside the United States. We may not be successful in finding, attracting, and retaining distribution partners or laboratories, or we may not be able to enter into such arrangements on favorable terms. Sales practices utilized by our distribution parties that are locally acceptable may not comply with sales practices standards required under United States laws that apply to us, which could create additional compliance risk. If our sales and marketing efforts are not successful outside the United States, we may not achieve significant market acceptance for our products outside the United States, which would materially and adversely impact our business operations.\nThe loss of any member of our senior management team or our inability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists, clinicians, and salespeople could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends on the skills, experience and performance of key members of our senior management team, including Michael J. Pellini, M.D., our President and Chief Executive Officer. The individual and collective efforts of these employees will be important as we continue to develop our molecular information platform and additional products, and as we expand our commercial activities. The loss or incapacity of existing members of our executive management team could adversely affect our operations if we experience difficulties in hiring qualified successors. Our executive officers have employment agreements; however, the existence of an employment agreement does not guarantee the retention of the executive officer for any period of time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance on any of our employees.\nOur research and development programs and laboratory operations depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists and technicians. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified scientists and technicians in the future due to the competition for qualified personnel among life science businesses, particularly in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We also face competition from universities and public and private research institutions in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel. We may have difficulties locating, recruiting, or retaining qualified sales people. Recruitment and retention difficulties can limit our ability to support our research and development and sales programs. All of our employees are at will, which means that either we or the employee may terminate their employment at any time.\nIf we were sued for product liability or professional liability, we could face substantial liabilities that exceed our resources.\nThe marketing, sale, and use of our products could lead to the filing of product liability claims were someone to allege that our products identified inaccurate or incomplete information regarding the genomic alterations of the tumor or malignancy analyzed, reported inaccurate or incomplete information concerning the available therapies for a certain type of cancer, or otherwise failed to perform as designed. We may also be subject to liability for errors in, a misunderstanding of, or inappropriate reliance upon the information we provide in the ordinary course of our business activities. A product liability or professional liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time-consuming for us to defend.\nWe maintain product and professional liability insurance, but this insurance may not fully protect us from the financial impact of defending against product liability or professional liability claims. Any product liability or professional liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future. Additionally, any product liability lawsuit could damage our reputation or cause current clinical or biopharmaceutical partners to terminate existing agreements and potential clinical or biopharmaceutical partners to seek other partners, any of which could impact our results of operations.\nWe depend on our information technology systems, and any failure of these systems could harm our business.\nWe depend on information technology and telecommunications systems for significant elements of our operations, including our laboratory information management system, our computational biology system, our knowledge management system, our customer reporting, and our ICE 2 portal. We have installed, and expect to expand, a number of enterprise software systems that affect a broad range of business processes and functional areas, including, for example, systems handling human resources, financial controls and reporting, contract management, regulatory compliance, and other infrastructure operations. In addition to the aforementioned business systems, we intend to extend the capabilities of both our preventative and detective security controls by augmenting the monitoring and alerting functions, the network design, and the automatic countermeasure operations of our technical systems. These information technology and telecommunications systems support a variety of functions, including laboratory operations, test validation, sample tracking, quality control, customer service support, billing and reimbursement, research and development activities, scientific and medical curation,\nand general administrative activities. In addition, our third-party billing and collections provider depends upon technology and telecommunications systems provided by outside vendors. Information technology and telecommunications systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts, and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security and back-up measures, some of our servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, and similar disruptive problems. Despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our information technology and telecommunications systems, failures or significant downtime of our information technology or telecommunications systems, or those used by our third-party service providers, could prevent us from conducting our comprehensive genomic analyses, preparing and providing reports and data to pathologists and oncologists, billing payors, processing reimbursement appeals, handling patient or physician inquiries, conducting research and development activities, and managing the administrative aspects of our business. Any disruption or loss of information technology or telecommunications systems on which critical aspects of our operations depend could have an adverse effect on our business.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data, and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we and our third-party billing and collections provider collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected health information, personally identifiable information, intellectual property, and proprietary business information owned or controlled by ourselves or our customers, payors, and biopharmaceutical partners. We manage and maintain our applications and data utilizing a combination of on-site systems, managed data center systems, and cloud-based data center systems. We also communicate, and facilitate the exchange of, sensitive patient data to customers through our ICE 2 portal. These applications and data encompass a wide variety of business-critical information including research and development information, commercial information, and business and financial information. We face four primary risks relative to protecting this critical information, including: unauthorized access risk; inappropriate disclosure risk; inappropriate modification risk; and the risk of our being unable to adequately monitor our controls over the first three risks.\nThe secure processing, storage, maintenance, and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protecting such information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure, and that of our third-party billing and collections provider, may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or viruses or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. Any such breach or interruption could compromise our networks, and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in governmental investigations, class action legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, such as HIPAA, and regulatory penalties. Although we have implemented security measures and a formal, dedicated enterprise security program to prevent unauthorized access to patient data, the ICE 2 portal, which is currently accessible through our online portal and will, in the future, be accessible through dedicated mobile applications, gives broad access to physicians, at which point we lose ability to control access, and there is no guarantee we absolutely protect our online portal or our mobile applications, from breach. Unauthorized access, loss, or dissemination could also disrupt our operations, including our ability to conduct our analyses, provide test results, bill payors or patients, process claims and appeals, provide customer assistance services, conduct research and development activities, collect, process, and prepare company financial information, provide information about our products and other patient and physician education and outreach efforts through our website, manage the administrative aspects of our business, and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nThe U.S. Office of Civil Rights may impose penalties on a covered entity for a failure to comply with a requirement of HIPAA. Penalties will vary significantly depending on factors such as the date of the violation,\nwhether the covered entity knew or should have known of the failure to comply, or whether the covered entity\u2019s failure to comply was due to willful neglect. These penalties include civil monetary penalties of $100 to $50,000 per violation, up to an annual cap of $1,500,000. A person who knowingly obtains or discloses individually identifiable health information in violation of HIPAA may face a criminal penalty of up to $50,000 and up to one year imprisonment. The criminal penalties increase to $100,000 and up to five years imprisonment if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses, and to $250,000 and up to 10 years imprisonment if the wrongful conduct involves the intent to sell, transfer, or use identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm. The U.S. Department of Justice is responsible for criminal prosecutions under HIPAA. Furthermore, in the event of a breach as defined by HIPAA, the covered entity has specific reporting requirements under HIPAA regulations. In the event of a significant breach, the reporting requirements could include notification to the general public.\nIn addition, the interpretation and application of consumer, health-related, and data protection laws in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory, and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. If so, this could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, these privacy regulations may differ from country to country, and may vary based on whether testing is performed in the United States or in the local country. Our operations or business practices may not comply with these regulations in each country, or complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business.\nWe may acquire other businesses, form joint ventures, or make investments in other companies or technologies that could negatively affect our operating results, dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership, increase our debt, or cause us to incur significant expense.\nOur business strategy may, from time to time, include pursuing acquisitions of businesses and assets. We also may pursue strategic alliances and joint ventures that leverage our proprietary molecular information platform and industry experience to expand our offerings or distribution. We have no experience with acquiring other companies and limited experience with forming strategic partnerships. Negotiating these transactions can be time consuming, difficult and expensive, and our ability to close these transactions may be subject to third-party approvals, such as governmental authorities, which are beyond our control. Consequently, we may not be able to complete such transactions on favorable terms and we can make no assurance that these transactions, once undertaken and announced, will close.\nAn acquisition or investment may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. In particular, we may not be able to integrate the businesses, products, personnel, or operations of the acquired companies, particularly if key personnel of the acquired business choose not to work for us, we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities and we may have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business. Acquisitions also could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or future write-offs of intangible assets or goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Integration of an acquired company also may disrupt ongoing operations and require management resources that we would otherwise focus on developing our existing business. As a result, we cannot be assured that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, technology license, strategic alliance, or joint venture would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unknown liabilities. These challenges related to acquisitions or investments could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nTo finance any acquisitions or joint ventures, we may choose to issue shares of our common stock as consideration, which would dilute the ownership of our stockholders. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other companies or fund a joint venture project using our stock as consideration.\nInternational expansion of our business exposes us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial, and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\nWe currently have limited international operations, but our business strategy incorporates potentially significant international expansion. We currently rely on distributor relationships to conduct physician and patient association outreach activities and to expand payor relationships outside of the United States. Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nmultiple, conflicting, and changing laws and regulations such as privacy regulations, tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements, and other governmental approvals, permits, and licenses;\n\u2022\nfailure by us or our distributors to obtain regulatory approvals for the use of our products in various countries;\n\u2022\nadditional, potentially relevant third-party patent rights;\n\u2022\ncomplexities and difficulties in obtaining protection and enforcing our intellectual property;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ncomplexities associated with managing multiple payor reimbursement regimes, government payors, or patient self-pay systems;\n\u2022\nlogistics and regulations associated with shipping tissue samples, including infrastructure conditions and transportation delays;\n\u2022\nlimits in our ability to penetrate international markets if we are not able to conduct our molecular tests locally;\n\u2022\nfinancial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty collecting accounts receivable, the impact of local and regional financial crises on demand and payment for our products, and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, and political unrest, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of trade, and other business restrictions; and\n\u2022\nregulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over sales and distributors\u2019 activities that may fall within the purview of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, its books and records provisions, or its anti-bribery provisions.\nAny of these factors could significantly harm our future international expansion and operations and, consequently, our revenue and results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and other worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nInternational customers have ordered, or may, in the future, order FoundationOne or FoundationOne Heme, and we are, therefore, subject to the FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making payments in violation of law to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any other improper advantage. Our current reliance on third-party distributors to sell FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme internationally demands a high degree of vigilance in maintaining our policy against participation in corrupt activity, because these distributors could be deemed to be our agents, and we could be held responsible for their actions. Other U.S. companies in the medical device and pharmaceutical field have faced criminal penalties under the FCPA for allowing their agents to deviate from appropriate practices in doing business with these individuals. We are also subject to similar anti-bribery laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the United Kingdom\u2019s Bribery Act of 2010, which went into effect in the third quarter of 2011, which also prohibits commercial bribery and makes it a crime for companies to fail to prevent bribery. These laws are complex and far-reaching in nature, and, as a result, we cannot assure you that we would not be required in the future to alter\none or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws, any changes in these laws, or the interpretation thereof. Any violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction, involve significant costs and expenses, including legal fees, and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, or results of operations. We could also suffer severe penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, and other remedial measures.\nOur employees, principal investigators, consultants, and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements, and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, principal investigators, consultants, and commercial partners. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with the regulations of the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data accurately, or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing, and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing, and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs, and other business arrangements. Such misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical studies, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. We currently have a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and our code of conduct and the other precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses, or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could result in the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions, which could have a significant impact on our business. Whether or not we are successful in defending against such actions or investigations, we could incur substantial costs, including legal fees, and divert the attention of management in defending ourselves against any of these claims or investigations.\nEconomic or business instability may have a negative impact on our business.\nContinuing concerns over United States health care reform legislation, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, and government stimulus programs in the United States and other countries have contributed to volatility for the global economy. If the economic climate does not improve, our business, including our access to patient samples and the addressable market for molecular information products that we may successfully develop, as well as the financial condition of our suppliers and our commercial third-party payors, could be adversely affected, resulting in a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, the instability has resulted in diminished liquidity and credit availability in the market, which could impair our ability to access capital if required or adversely affect our operations. In the event of further economic slowdown, investment in biopharmaceutical research and development may also experience a corresponding slowdown.\nIf we use hazardous materials in a manner that causes injury, we could be liable for damages.\nOur activities currently require the use of hazardous chemicals. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling, or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have. Additionally, we are subject on an ongoing basis to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling, and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may become significant, and could negatively affect our operating results.\nOur income tax provision and other tax liabilities may be insufficient if taxing authorities are successful in asserting tax positions that are contrary to our position.\nSignificant judgment is required by us to determine our provision for income taxes and our liabilities for taxes. From time to time, we are reviewed or audited by various federal, state, local and foreign authorities regarding income tax matters. Although we believe our judgment in determining the appropriate tax treatment is supportable and in accordance with relevant guidance, it is possible that the final tax authority may take a tax position that is different than that which is reflected in our income tax provision or different than the taxes we previously paid. Such differences could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision or benefit or otherwise require the payment of additional taxes and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and/or cash flows for such period.\nReimbursement and Regulatory Risks Relating to Our Business\nIf commercial third-party payors or government payors fail to provide coverage or adequate reimbursement, or if there is a decrease in the amount of reimbursement for FoundationOne, FoundationOne Heme or future products we develop, if any, our revenue and prospects for profitability would be harmed.\nIn both domestic and many international markets, sales of FoundationOne, FoundationOne Heme or any future molecular information products we develop will depend, in large part, upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. These third-party payors include government healthcare programs such as Medicare, managed care providers, ACOs, private health insurers, and other organizations. In particular, we believe that obtaining a positive national coverage decision and favorable reimbursement rate from CMS, for FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme will be a necessary element in achieving material commercial success. Physicians and patients may not order FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme unless commercial third-party payors and government payors pay for all, or a substantial portion, of the list price, and certain commercial third-party payors may not agree to reimburse FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme if CMS or our local MAC does not issue a positive coverage decision.\nThere is currently no national coverage decision that determines whether and how our test is covered by Medicare. In the absence of a national coverage determination, local MACs, that administer the Medicare program in various regions have some discretion in determining coverage and, therefore, payment for tests. At the time FoundationOne was launched in 2012, our local MAC initially requested that we not submit claims for services provided to Medicare patients while the MAC assessed the appropriate coding, coverage, and payment for FoundationOne as a whole. To accommodate this request, we deferred the submission of claims until November 2013, when we commenced the process of submitting claims to National Government Services, our current MAC, for FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme tests for Medicare patients with dates of service on or after November 1, 2013.\nWe are submitting claims to National Government Services using a miscellaneous CPT code. When submitting claims for services or procedures that do not have specific CPT codes, providers may submit those claims using a CPT code, referred to as the miscellaneous CPT code, to provide the means of reporting and tracking services and procedures until a more specific CPT code is established. We are not submitting claims using stacked CPT codes in the manner currently used in submitting claims to non-governmental, commercial third-party payors. The use of a miscellaneous CPT code may decrease the likelihood of reimbursement given that a miscellaneous CPT code is a single CPT code that does not represent an identified service or procedure. We have not received any payments for FoundationOne or FoundationOne Heme provided to patients covered by Medicare to date. If CMS does not issue a positive national coverage determination, or National Government Services does not issue a local coverage determination, with respect to FoundationOne and/or FoundationOne Heme, or if National Government Services denies reimbursement of FoundationOne and/or FoundationOne Heme, withdraws its coverage policies after reimbursement is obtained, reviews and adjusts the rate of reimbursement, or stops paying for FoundationOne and/or FoundationOne Heme altogether, our revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe have not received payments from Medicare for the claims submitted. The response to date of National Government Services to the submission of our claims has been to deny payment, and we have decided to appeal those claims. The response to those appeals is uncertain. National Government Services may deny paying a claim pending a coverage or payment determination. Even if we do receive payments from National Government Services on these appeals, the reimbursement rate may be lower than we expect, and if such rate is then adopted by commercial third-party payors, it would have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. In addition, National Government Services may issue a non-coverage determination for FoundationOne and/or FoundationOne Heme that would apply to future claims. Although we would have the opportunity to submit additional materials to National Government Services in support of a positive coverage determination for FoundationOne and/or FoundationOne Heme, there is no guarantee that National Government Services would provide us with a positive coverage decision or reverse a non-coverage decision that it already issued.\nCommercial third-party payors and government payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by demanding price discounts or rebates and limiting both coverage on which diagnostic products they will pay for and the amounts that they will pay for new molecular diagnostic products. Because of the cost-containment trends, commercial third-party payors and government payors that currently provide reimbursement for, or in the future cover, FoundationOne and/or FoundationOne Heme may reduce, suspend, revoke, or discontinue payments or coverage at any time, including those payors that designate FoundationOne and/or FoundationOne Heme as experimental and investigational. The percentage of submitted claims that are ultimately paid, the length of time to receive payment on claims, and the average reimbursement of those paid claims, is likely to vary from period to period.\nAs a result, there is significant uncertainty surrounding whether the use of products that incorporate new technology, such as FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme, will be eligible for coverage by commercial third-party payors and government payors or, if eligible for coverage, what the reimbursement rates will be for those products. The fact that a diagnostic product has been approved for reimbursement in the past, for any particular indication or in any particular jurisdiction, does not guarantee that such a diagnostic product will remain approved for reimbursement or that similar or additional diagnostic products will be approved in the future. We have had claims for reimbursement denied by certain commercial third-party payors, in some cases because they have designated FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme as experimental and investigational. Reimbursement of NGS-based cancer products by commercial third-party payors and government payors may depend on a number of factors, including a payor\u2019s determination that FoundationOne, FoundationOne Heme, or products enabled by our molecular information platform are:\n\u2022\nnot experimental or investigational;\n\u2022\nmedically necessary;\n\u2022\nappropriate for the specific patient;\n\u2022\ncost effective;\n\u2022\nsupported by peer-reviewed publications;\n\u2022\nincluded in clinical practice guidelines; and\n\u2022\nsupported by clinical utility studies demonstrating improved outcomes.\nAs a result, our efforts to receive reimbursement on behalf of patients will take a substantial amount of time, and various commercial third-party payors and government payors may never cover or provide adequate payment for FoundationOne, FoundationOne Heme, or future molecular information products we develop. Our strategy to achieve broad reimbursement coverage is focused on demonstrating the clinical utility and economic benefits of FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme, including engagement with key members of the oncology community and increasing physician demand, but there is no assurance that we will succeed in any of these areas or that, even if we do succeed, we will receive favorable reimbursement decisions. If adequate third-party reimbursement is unavailable, we may not be able to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on\ninvestment in product development. Furthermore, if a commercial third-party payor or government payor denies coverage, it may be difficult for us to collect from the patient, and we may not be successful.\nIn addition, we are currently considered a \u201cnon-contracted provider\u201d by all but one commercial third-party payor because we have not entered into specific contracts to provide FoundationOne and/or FoundationOne Heme to their covered patients, and as a result we take on primary responsibility for obtaining reimbursement on behalf of patients. If we were to become a contracted provider with additional commercial third-party payors in the future, the amount of overall reimbursement we receive may decrease if we were to be reimbursed less money per test performed at a contracted rate than at a non-contracted rate, which could have a negative impact on our revenue. Further, we may be unable to collect payments from patients beyond that which is paid by their coverage, and will experience lost revenue as a result.\nThe United States and foreign governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in some foreign markets, the government controls the pricing of many healthcare products. We expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals to implement governmental controls or impose healthcare requirements. In addition, the Medicare program and increasing emphasis on managed or accountable care in the United States will continue to put pressure on product pricing. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we would receive for any products in the future, which would limit our revenue and profitability.\nChanges in the way that the FDA regulates products developed, manufactured, validated, and performed by laboratories like ours could result in additional expense in offering our products and products that we may develop in the future or even possible delay or suspension of such products.\nWhile the FDA currently exercises its enforcement discretion for laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, by not requiring compliance with its regulations, on July 31, 2014, the FDA announced that it intends to change this policy. The FDA previously announced in June 2010 that it intended to no longer exercise enforcement discretion for LDTs and subsequently stated that it would publish guidance documents describing an approach to regulating LDTs. Pursuant to the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, the FDA was required to notify Congress at least sixty days prior to publishing any guidance documents implementing a new regulatory policy for LDTs. On July 31, 2014, the FDA provided the required notification, including draft guidance documents, to Congress and in October 2014, FDA formally published the draft guidance documents. In the draft guidance documents, the FDA stated that it had serious concerns regarding the lack of independent review of the evidence of clinical validity of LDTs and asserted that the requirements under CLIA do not address the clinical validity of any LDT. If published and finalized in the same form, the guidance documents would impose a risk-based, phased-in approach for LDTs similar to the existing in vitro diagnostic devices framework.\nUnder the risk-based approach described in the draft guidance documents, the FDA would rely upon its existing medical device classification system to evaluate the risk of LDTs. The FDA would require that laboratories providing LDTs, subject to certain limited exemptions, within six months after the guidance documents are finalized comply with (i) either a new notification procedure in which the laboratory must provide the FDA with certain basic information about each LDT offered by their laboratory or the FDA\u2019s device registration and listing requirements, and (ii) the medical device reporting requirements for LDTs offered by that laboratory. The FDA\u2019s premarket review requirements would begin twelve months after finalization of the guidance documents for the highest risk tests, including LDTs with the same intended use as a companion diagnostic or LDTs with the same intended use as an FDA-approved Class III medical device. Premarket review would begin immediately for newly developed LDTs in this highest-risk group. Premarket review for other LDTs classified as high-risk by the FDA would be phased in over the next four years and the FDA expects to announce the priority list for premarket review for the remaining Class III LDTs within 24 months from finalization of this guidance. The FDA identified certain tests as higher risk, including LDTs that act like companion diagnostics, LDTs that screen for serious diseases or conditions for use in asymptomatic patients with no other available confirmatory diagnostic product or procedure, and LDTs for certain infectious diseases with high-risk intended uses. Such higher risk LDTs would likely receive higher priority during the phased-in enforcement period.\nPremarket review of moderate-risk (Class II) LDTs would be phased-in over a period of four years following completion of the premarket review period for LDTs classified as high-risk. If classified as Class III medical devices, our tests would likely be required to be approved by the FDA under a premarket approval application or PMA, which must be supported by valid scientific evidence to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the subject product, typically including the results of human clinical trials. Until premarket review is required for a test, the LDT could remain on the market while the FDA reviews the applications or premarket notifications for such tests. In addition, once a premarket application is submitted to FDA or FDA issues a 510(k) clearance order, the laboratory must also comply with FDA\u2019s quality system regulation.\nThe FDA\u2019s draft guidance documents for LDTs were published on October 3, 2014, and the FDA is currently accepting comments from the public for a period of time before deciding whether to issue final guidance documents implementing the same or modified versions of the draft guidance documents. There is no time frame in which the FDA must issue final guidance documents.\nIf the FDA requires us to seek clearance or approval to offer FoundationOne, FoundationOne Heme, or any of our future products for clinical use, we may not be able to obtain such approvals on a timely basis, or at all. If premarket review is required, our business could be negatively impacted if we are required to stop selling molecular information products pending their clearance or approval or the launch of any new products that we develop could be delayed by new requirements. The cost of conducting clinical trials and otherwise developing data and information to support premarket applications may be significant. In addition, future regulation by the FDA could subject our business to further regulatory risks and costs. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements of the FDA could result in enforcement action, including receiving untitled or warning letters, fines, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties. In addition, we could be subject to a recall or seizure of current or future products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production. Any such enforcement action would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations.\nIn addition, in November 2013, the FDA finalized guidance regarding the sale and use of products labeled for research or investigational use only. Among other things, the guidance advises that the FDA continues to be concerned about distribution of research-investigational-use only products intended for clinical diagnostic use and that the manufacturer\u2019s objective intent for the product\u2019s intended use will be determined by examining the totality of circumstances, including advertising, instructions for clinical interpretation, presentations that describe clinical use, and specialized technical support such as assistance performance clinical validation, surrounding the distribution of the product in question. The FDA has advised that if evidence demonstrates that a product is inappropriately labeled for research or investigational use only, the device would be misbranded and adulterated within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Some of the reagents and other products we use in FoundationOne are currently labeled as research-use only products. If the FDA were to undertake enforcement actions, some of our suppliers may cease selling research-use only products to us, and any failure to obtain an acceptable substitute could significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHealthcare policy changes, including recently enacted legislation reforming the U.S. health care system, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn March 2010, legislation collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, was enacted in the United States. The ACA made a number of substantial changes in the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other things, the ACA:\n\u2022\nrequires each medical device manufacturer to pay a sales tax equal to 2.3% of the price for which such manufacturer sells its medical devices, beginning in 2013. This tax could apply to FoundationOne, FoundationOne Heme and some or all of our products which are in development; and\n\u2022\nmandates a reduction in payments for clinical laboratory services paid under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule of 1.75% for the years 2011 through 2015. In addition, a productivity adjustment is made to the fee schedule payment amount.\nOn April 1, 2013, cuts to the federal budget were implemented, requiring a 2% cut in Medicare payments for all services, including clinical laboratory testing. In December 2013, Congress extended this 2% cut for an additional two years until 2023.\nMany CPT procedure codes that we use to bill our products were revised by the American Medical Association, effective January 1, 2013. These new CPT codes were developed and implemented for individual genes, or the components of a multi-gene panel. In the Final Rule for 2013, CMS announced that it decided to keep the new molecular codes on the CLFS, rather than move them to the PFS. CMS then announced that for 2013, it would price the new codes using a \u201cgap filling\u201d process. Under this approach, CMS referred the CPT codes to the MACs to allow them to determine an appropriate price. CMS then calculated the median of the pricing provided by the MACs to establish and publish a National Limit Amount, or NLA, by CPT code for 2014.\nIn 2014, new codes for sequencing-based panel tests were approved and implemented by the American Medical Association, effective January 1, 2015. In the fall of 2014, CMS announced that for 2015, it would price the new codes using a \u201cgap filling\u201d process. Under this approach, CMS referred the CPT codes to the MACs to allow them to determine an appropriate price if they deem the codes to be covered services. CMS will then calculate the median of the pricing provided by the MACs to establish and publish a National Limit Amount, or NLA, by CPT code for 2016. However, for 2015, if CMS reduces reimbursement for the new CPT codes for individual genes or fails to price the new multi-gene panel codes, or if commercial payors who often base pricing on Medicare fee schedules reduce non-contracted payment rates below the new NLA amount for CPT codes corresponding to individual genes, mandate use of the new sequencing-based panel CPT codes, or decide to stop payment on specific CPT codes altogether, our revenue could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, in April 2014 the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or the Act, was enacted into law which reforms the Medicare payment system for clinical laboratory tests paid through the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS. The Act rescinds CMS statutory authority to make adjustments to future payments for tests based on \u201ctechnological changes,\u201d which CMS had intended to apply to certain test codes on the CLFS beginning in calendar year 2015. Beginning in January 2017, Medicare payment for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests will be established by a market-based payment system. Under this new methodology CMS will establish Medicare payment for each test based on the weighted median of the payment rates for private payors for the test. The Act creates a new class of Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory Tests defined as sole source multi-analyte tests with a unique algorithm yielding a single result or a test that is cleared or approved by FDA or other such criteria developed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. For Medicare payment prior to 2017, the Act creates a transitional period for both new and existing tests. Our average commercial payor reimbursement starting in 2017 could be adversely affected depending upon if and how payors adopt this new CMS pricing methodology and resulting rates.\nWe cannot predict whether future health care initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level, or how any future legislation or regulation may affect us. The taxes imposed by the new federal legislation and the expansion of government\u2019s role in the U.S. health care industry, as well as changes to the reimbursement amounts paid by payors for FoundationOne, FoundationOne Heme, and future products may reduce our profits, and have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Moreover, Congress has proposed, on several occasions, to impose a significant reduction in payment rates and/or 20% coinsurance on patients for clinical laboratory tests reimbursed under the CLFS. These adjustments would require us to bill patients for these amounts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIf we fail to comply with the complex federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the CLIA, a federal law that regulates clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease. CLIA regulations mandate specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance, and inspections. We have a current certificate of accreditation under CLIA to conduct our genomic analyses through our accreditation by CAP. To renew this certificate, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years. Moreover, CLIA inspectors may make unannounced inspections of our clinical reference laboratory at any time.\nWe are also required to maintain a license to conduct testing in Massachusetts. Massachusetts laws establish standards for day-to-day operation of our clinical laboratory, including the training and skills required of personnel and quality control over and above that required by CLIA. We are also licensed to conduct testing by the states of California, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Florida, Rhode Island, and in New York, where we have received a permit from the New York State Department of Health to conduct FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme testing and deliver the related test report for specimens originating from New York. If we do not maintain these licenses or if our approval is revoked, our business would suffer. Moreover, other states may adopt similar requirements in the future. We may be subject to regulation in foreign jurisdictions as we seek to expand international distribution of our products and consider establishing clinical laboratory operations outside the United States. International regulation may require prior review or approval of our products or services, may impose limits on the export of tissue necessary for us to perform our tests, and, should we establish laboratory operations outside the United States, may require us to obtain licenses and other operating permits. This additional regulation may affect our ability to provide our products and services and to conduct laboratory operations outside of the United States. If we are unable to comply with existing laws and regulations or changes to the laws and regulations, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nAny sanction imposed under CLIA, its implementing regulations, or state or foreign laws or regulations governing licensure, or our failure to renew a CLIA certificate, a state or foreign license, or accreditation, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Most CLIA deficiencies are not classified as \u201ccondition-level\u201d deficiencies, and there are no adverse effects upon the laboratory operations as long as the deficiencies are corrected. Remediation of these deficiencies are routine matters, with corrections occurring within several hours or weeks. More serious CLIA deficiencies could rise to the level of \u201ccondition-level\u201d deficiencies, and CMS has the authority to impose a wide range of sanctions, including revocation of the CLIA certification along with a bar on the ownership or operation of a CLIA certified laboratory by any owners or operators of the deficient laboratory. There is an administrative hearing procedure that can be pursued by the laboratory in the event of imposition of such sanctions, during which the sanctions are stayed, but the process can take a number of years to complete. If we were to lose our CLIA certification or CAP accreditation, we would not be able to operate our clinical reference laboratory and conduct our molecular tests, which would result in material harm to our business and results of operations.\nWe furnish to biopharmaceutical partners and academic researchers genomic information that has been de-identified in accordance with HIPAA and relevant international health information privacy regulations. The laws of certain states may require specific consent either to retain or utilize certain genetic information even if such information has been de-identified. A finding that we have failed to comply with any such laws and any remedial activities required to ensure compliance with such laws could cause us to incur substantial costs, to change our business practices, or to limit the retention or use of genetic information in a manner that, individually or collectively, could be adverse to our business.\nOur operations are subject to other extensive federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, all of which are subject to change. These laws and regulations currently include, among others:\n\u2022\nHIPAA, which established comprehensive federal standards with respect to the privacy and security of protected health information and requirements for the use of certain standardized electronic transactions, particularly with respect to our online portal, the Interactive Cancer Explorer;\n\u2022\namendments to HIPAA under the HITECH Act, which strengthen and expand HIPAA privacy and security compliance requirements, increase penalties for violators, extend enforcement authority to state attorneys general, and impose requirements for breach notification;\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program;\n\u2022\nthe federal Stark physician self-referral law, which prohibits a physician from making a referral for certain designated health services covered by the Medicare program, including laboratory and pathology services, if the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship with the entity providing the designated health services, unless the financial relationship falls within an applicable exception to the prohibition;\n\u2022\nthe federal False Claims Act, which imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government;\n\u2022\nthe federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state health care program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies;\n\u2022\nother federal and state fraud and abuse laws, such as anti-kickback laws, prohibitions on self-referral, fee-splitting restrictions, prohibitions on the provision of products at no or discounted cost to induce physician or patient adoption, and false claims acts, which may extend to services reimbursable by any third-party payor, including private insurers;\n\u2022\nthe prohibition on reassignment of Medicare claims, which, subject to certain exceptions, precludes the reassignment of Medicare claims to any other party;\n\u2022\nthe rules regarding billing for diagnostic tests reimbursable by the Medicare program, which prohibit a physician or other supplier from marking up the price of the technical component or professional component of a diagnostic test ordered by the physician or other supplier and supervised or performed by a physician who does not \u201cshare a practice\u201d with the billing physician or supplier;\n\u2022\nstate laws that prohibit other specified practices, such as billing physicians for testing that they order; waiving coinsurance, copayments, deductibles, and other amounts owed by patients; billing a state Medicaid program at a price that is higher than what is charged to one or more other payors; and\n\u2022\nsimilar foreign laws and regulations that apply to us in the countries in which we operate.\nOur failure to comply could lead to civil or criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, or prohibitions or restrictions on our laboratory\u2019s ability to conduct commercial activities. We believe that we are in material compliance with all statutory and regulatory requirements, but there is a risk that one or more government agencies could take a contrary position. These laws and regulations are complex and are subject to interpretation by the courts and by government agencies. If one or more such agencies alleges that we may be in violation of any of these requirements, regardless of the outcome, it could damage our\nreputation and adversely affect important business relationships with third parties, including managed care organizations and other commercial third-party payors.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. If we are found to have improperly promoted off-label uses, we may become subject to significant fines and other liability.\nFoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme deliver to physicians a report that describes a tumor\u2019s or hematologic cancer\u2019s genomic alterations and matches them with FDA-approved therapies or open clinical trials for therapies targeting cancers driven by those alterations. In some cases, the therapies identified in our report are not approved for the patient\u2019s cancer or disease state. The FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription drug and device products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses or indications beyond those contained in such product\u2019s approved labeling. The U.S. government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. If the FDA determines that we have engaged in off-label promotion in our FoundationOne or FoundationOne Heme reports by providing information regarding approved therapies, we may be subject to civil or criminal fines.\nIn addition, incentives exist under applicable laws that encourage competitors, employees, and physicians to report violations of rules governing promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. These incentives could lead to so-called whistleblower lawsuits as part of which such persons seek to collect a portion of monies allegedly overbilled to government agencies due to, for example, promotion of pharmaceutical products beyond labeled claims. These incentives could also lead to suits that we have mischaracterized a competitor\u2019s product in the marketplace and, as a result, we could be sued for alleged damages to our competitors. Such lawsuits, whether with or without merit, are typically time-consuming and costly to defend. Such suits may also result in related stockholder lawsuits, which are also costly to defend.\nWe may be subject to fines, penalties, licensure requirements, or legal liability, if it is determined that through our FoundationOne or FoundationOne Heme reports we are practicing medicine without a license.\nOur FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme reports delivered to physicians provide information regarding FDA-approved therapies and clinical trials that oncologists may use in making treatment decisions for their patients. We make members of our organization available to discuss the information provided in the report. State laws prohibit the practice of medicine without a license. Our customer service representatives provide support to our customers, including assistance in interpreting the FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme report results. A governmental authority or individual actor could allege that the identification of available therapies and clinical trials in our reports and the related customer service we provide constitute the practice of medicine. A state may seek to have us discontinue the inclusion of certain aspects of our reports or the related services we provide or subject us to fine, penalties, or licensure requirements. Any determination that we are practicing medicine without a license may result in significant liability to us.\nIf the validity of an informed consent from a patient enrolled in a clinical trial with one of our biopharmaceutical partners was challenged, we could be forced to stop using some of our resources, which would hinder our molecular information product development efforts.\nWe have implemented measures to ensure that all clinical data and genetic and other biological samples that we receive from our biopharmaceutical partners have been collected from subjects who have provided appropriate informed consent for purposes which extend to our product development activities. We seek to ensure these data and samples are provided to us on a subject de-identified manner. We also have measures in place to ensure that the subjects from whom the data and samples are collected do not retain or have conferred on them any proprietary or commercial rights to the data or any discoveries derived from them. Our\nbiopharmaceutical partners conduct clinical trials in a number of different countries, and, to a large extent, we rely upon them to comply with the subject\u2019s informed consent and with local law and international regulation. The collection of data and samples in many different countries results in complex legal questions regarding the adequacy of informed consent and the status of genetic material under a large number of different legal systems. The subject\u2019s informed consent obtained in any particular country could be challenged in the future, and those informed consents could prove invalid, unlawful, or otherwise inadequate for our purposes. Any findings against us, or our biopharmaceutical partners, could deny us access to or force us to stop using some of our clinical samples, which would hinder our molecular information product development efforts. We could become involved in legal challenges, which could consume our management and financial resources.\nEthical, legal, and social concerns related to the use of genomic information could reduce demand for our molecular information products.\nGenomic testing, like that conducted using our molecular information platform, FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme, has raised ethical, legal, and social issues regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information. Governmental authorities could, for social or other purposes, limit or regulate the use of genomic information or genomic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions, particularly for those that have no known cure. Similarly, these concerns may lead patients to refuse to use genomic tests even if permissible.\nEthical and social concerns may also influence U.S. and foreign patent offices and courts with regard to patent protection for technology relevant to our business. These and other ethical, legal, and social concerns may limit market acceptance of our products or reduce the potential markets for products enabled by our molecular information platform, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIntellectual Property Risks Related to Our Business\nLitigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from selling our products or impact our stock price.\nThird parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. As we continue to commercialize each of FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme in their current or updated forms, launch new products, and enter new markets, we expect that competitors will claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of business strategies designed to impede our successful commercialization and entry into new markets. We occasionally receive letters from third parties inviting us to take licenses under, or alleging that we infringe, their patents. Third parties may have obtained, and may in the future obtain, patents under which such third parties may claim that the use of our technologies constitutes patent infringement.\nWe could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims. Any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in defending ourselves against these claims could have a material adverse impact on our cash position and stock price. Furthermore, parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief, which could block our ability to develop, commercialize, and sell products, and could result in the award of substantial damages against us. In the event of a successful claim of infringement or misappropriation against us, we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties, or be prohibited from selling certain products, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our cash position and business and financial condition.\nIn addition, we may be unable to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost, if at all. We could, therefore, incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties, which could negatively affect our gross margins. Moreover, we could encounter delays in product introductions while we\nattempt to develop alternative methods or products. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing products, and the prohibition of sale of any of our products would materially affect our ability to grow and maintain profitability and have a material adverse impact on our business.\nDevelopments in patent law could have a negative impact on our business.\nFrom time to time, the United States Supreme Court, or the Supreme Court, other federal courts, the United States Congress, or the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, may change the standards of patentability and any such changes could have a negative impact on our business.\nTwo cases involving diagnostic method claims and \u201cgene patents\u201d have recently been decided by the Supreme Court. On March 20, 2012, the Supreme Court issued a decision in Mayo Collaborative v. Prometheus Laboratories, or Prometheus, a case involving patent claims directed to optimizing the amount of drug administered to a specific patient. According to that decision, Prometheus\u2019 claims failed to incorporate sufficient inventive content above and beyond mere underlying natural correlations to allow the claimed processes to qualify as patent-eligible processes that apply natural laws. On June 13, 2013, the Supreme Court subsequently decided Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, or Myriad, a case brought by multiple plaintiffs challenging the validity of patent claims held by Myriad Genetics, Inc. relating to the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, holding that isolated genomic DNA that exists in nature, such as the DNA constituting the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, is not patentable subject matter, but that cDNA, which is an artificial construct created from RNA transcripts of genes, may be patent eligible.\nOn December 16, 2014, the USPTO issued interim guidance, entitled \u201c2014 Interim Guidance on Patent Subject Matter Eligibility,\u201d which is for use by USPTO personnel in examining patent claims reciting judicially recognized exceptions to patentable subject matter, including laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas, for patent eligibility in view of the Supreme Court decisions in Prometheus, Myriad, and Alice Corporation Pty. Ltd. V. CLS Bank International, or Alice Corp. The guidance indicates that claims reciting a judicial exception to patent-eligible subject matter must amount to significantly more than the judicial exception itself in order to be patent-eligible subject matter. We cannot assure you that our efforts to seek patent protection for our technology and products will not be negatively impacted by this interim guidance issued by the USPTO, the decisions described above, rulings in other cases, or changes in guidance or procedures issued by the USPTO.\nWe cannot fully predict what impact the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Prometheus, Myriad, and Alice Corp. may have on the ability of biopharmaceutical companies or other entities to obtain or enforce patents relating to DNA, genes, or genomic-related discoveries in the future. Despite the USPTO interim guidance described above, the contours of when claims reciting laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas may meet the patent eligibility requirements are not clear and may take years to develop via interpretation at the USPTO and in the courts. There are many previously issued patents claiming nucleic acids and diagnostic methods based on natural correlations that issued before the recent Supreme Court decisions discussed, and although many of these patents may be invalid under the standards set forth in the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions, until successfully challenged, these patents are presumed valid and enforceable, and certain third parties could allege that we infringe, or request that we obtain a license to, these patents. Whether based on patents issued prior to or after these Supreme Court decisions, we could have to defend ourselves against claims of patent infringement, or choose to license rights, if available, under patents claiming such methods. In particular, although the Supreme Court has held in Myriad that isolated genomic DNA is not patent-eligible subject matter, certain third parties could allege that activities that we may undertake infringe other classes of gene-related patent claims, and we could have to defend ourselves against these claims by asserting non-infringement and/or invalidity positions, or pay to obtain a license to these claims. In any of the foregoing or in other situations involving third-party intellectual property rights, if we are unsuccessful in defending against claims of patent infringement, we could be forced to pay damages or be subjected to an injunction that would prevent us from utilizing the patented subject matter in question if we are unable to obtain a license on reasonable terms. Such outcomes could\nmaterially affect our ability to offer our products and have a material adverse impact on our business. Even if we are able to obtain a license or successfully defend against claims of patent infringement, the cost and distraction associated with the defense or settlement of these claims could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act, which was signed into law in 2011, includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These changes include a transition from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system, changes to the way issued patents are challenged, and changes to the way patent applications are disputed during the examination process. These changes may favor larger and more established companies that have greater resources to devote to patent application filing and prosecution. The USPTO has developed new and untested regulations and procedures to govern the full implementation of the America Invents Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the America Invents Act, and, in particular, the first-to-file provisions, became effective on March 16, 2013. Substantive changes to patent law associated with the America Invents Act may affect our ability to obtain patents, and, if obtained, to enforce or defend them. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the America Invents Act will ultimately have on the cost of prosecuting our patent applications, our ability to obtain patents based on our discoveries and our ability to enforce or defend any patents that may issue from our patent applications, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property effectively, which could harm our competitive position.\nObtaining and maintaining a strong patent position is important to our business. Many of our patent applications are in the early stages of prosecution. Patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is complex and uncertain, so we cannot be assured that we will be able to obtain or maintain patent rights, or that the patent rights we may obtain will be valuable, provide an effective barrier to competitors or otherwise provide competitive advantages. Others have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications that are similar or identical to ours or those of our licensors. To determine the priority of inventions, or demonstrate that we did not derive our invention from another, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO or in court that could result in substantial costs in legal fees and could substantially affect the scope of our patent protection. We cannot be assured our patent applications will prevail over those filed by others. Also, our intellectual property rights may be subject to other challenges by third parties. Patents we obtain could be challenged in litigation or in administrative proceedings such as ex parte reexam, inter partes review, or post-grant review in the United States or opposition proceedings in Europe or other jurisdictions.\nObtaining and maintaining a patent portfolio entails significant expense and resources. Part of the expense includes periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees, various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications due in several stages over the lifetime of patents and/or applications, as well as the cost associated with complying with numerous procedural provisions during the patent application process. We may or may not choose to pursue or maintain protection for particular inventions. In addition, there are situations in which failure to make certain payments or noncompliance with certain requirements in the patent process can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we choose to forego patent protection or allow a patent application or patent to lapse purposefully or inadvertently, our competitive position could suffer.\nLegal actions to enforce our patent rights can be expensive and may involve the diversion of significant management time. In addition, these legal actions could be unsuccessful and could also result in the invalidation of our patents or a finding that they are unenforceable. We may or may not choose to pursue litigation or interferences against those that have infringed our patents, due to the associated expense and time commitment of monitoring these activities. If we fail to protect or to enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to patent protection, we also rely upon copyright and trade secret protection, as well as non-disclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties, to protect our confidential and proprietary information. For example, significant elements of FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme, including aspects of sample preparation, computational-biological algorithms, and related processes and software, are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how that are not publicly disclosed. In addition to contractual measures, we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using physical and technological security measures. Such measures may not, for example, in the case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee or third party with authorized access, provide adequate protection for our proprietary information. Our security measures may not prevent an employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor, and recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, trade secrets may be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. If any of our confidential or proprietary information, such as our trade secrets, were to be disclosed or misappropriated, or if any such information were independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position could be harmed.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to biotechnology. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents, if obtained, or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Patent protection must ultimately be sought on a country-by-country basis, which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of intellectual property.\nThird parties may assert ownership or commercial rights to inventions we develop.\nThird parties may in the future make claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our intellectual property. For example, we rely on certain third parties to provide us with tissue samples and biological materials that we use to conduct our genomic analyses. We have written agreements with collaborators that provide for the ownership of intellectual property arising from our collaborations. These agreements provide that we must negotiate certain commercial rights with collaborators with respect to joint inventions or inventions made by our collaborators that arise from the results of the collaboration. In some instances, there may not be adequate written provisions to address clearly the resolution of intellectual property rights that may arise from a collaboration. If we cannot successfully negotiate sufficient ownership and commercial rights to the inventions that result from our use of a third-party collaborator\u2019s materials where required, or if disputes otherwise arise with respect to the intellectual property developed with the use of a collaborator\u2019s samples, we may be limited in our ability to\ncapitalize on the market potential of these inventions. In addition, we may face claims that our agreements with employees, contractors, or consultants obligating them to assign intellectual property to us are ineffective, or in conflict with prior or competing contractual obligations of assignment, which could result in ownership disputes regarding intellectual property we have developed or will develop and interfere with our ability to capture the commercial value of such inventions. Litigation may be necessary to resolve an ownership dispute, and if we are not successful, we may be precluded from using certain intellectual property, or may lose our exclusive rights in that intellectual property. Either outcome could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThird parties may assert that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information or misappropriated trade secrets.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other diagnostic or biopharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of a former employer or other third parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe are an early, commercial-stage company and have a limited operating history, which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance.\nWe are an early, commercial-stage company and have a limited operating history. We were incorporated in Delaware and began operations in November 2009. Our limited operating history, particularly in light of our business model based upon sales of novel products enabled by our molecular information platform and the rapidly evolving genomic analysis industry, may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance. Any assessment of our profitability or prediction about our future success or viability is subject to significant uncertainty. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by early-, commercial-stage companies in rapidly evolving industries. If we do not address these risks successfully, our business will suffer.\nWe have a history of net losses. We expect to incur net losses in the future and we may never achieve sustained profitability.\nWe have historically incurred substantial net losses, including a net loss of $52.2 million in 2014. From our inception in 2009 through December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $142.0 million. We expect our losses to continue as a result of ongoing research and development expenses and increased selling and marketing costs. These losses have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our working capital, total assets, and stockholders\u2019 equity. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our research, development, and commercialization efforts, we are unable to predict when we will become profitable, and we may never become profitable. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our inability to achieve and then maintain profitability would negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe may need to raise additional capital to fund our existing operations, develop our molecular information platform, commercialize new products and expand our operations.\nIf our available cash balances, net proceeds from our initial public offering, and anticipated cash flow from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements including because of lower demand for our\nproducts as a result of lower than currently expected rates of reimbursement from commercial third-party payors and government payors or other risks described in this Annual Report, we may seek to sell common or preferred equity or convertible debt securities, enter into an additional credit facility or another form of third-party funding, or seek other debt financing.\nWe may consider raising additional capital in the future to expand our business, to pursue strategic investments, to take advantage of financing opportunities, or for other reasons, including to:\n\u2022\nincrease our sales and marketing efforts to drive market adoption of FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme and address competitive developments;\n\u2022\nfund development and marketing efforts of any future products;\n\u2022\nfurther expand our clinical laboratory operations;\n\u2022\nexpand our technologies into other types of cancers;\n\u2022\nacquire, license or invest in technologies, including information technologies;\n\u2022\nacquire or invest in complementary businesses or assets; and\n\u2022\nfinance capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses.\nOur present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to achieve revenue growth;\n\u2022\nour rate of progress in establishing reimbursement arrangements with domestic and international commercial third-party payors and government payors;\n\u2022\nthe cost of expanding our laboratory operations and offerings, including our sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nour rate of progress in, and cost of the sales and marketing activities associated with, establishing adoption of and reimbursement for FoundationOne and FoundationOne Heme;\n\u2022\nour rate of progress in, and cost of research and development activities associated with, products in research and early development;\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022\ncosts related to international expansion; and\n\u2022\nthe potential cost of and delays in product development as a result of any regulatory oversight applicable to our products.\nThe various ways we could raise additional capital carry potential risks. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to our stockholders could result. Any equity securities issued also could provide for rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities, those debt securities would have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. The terms of debt securities issued or borrowings pursuant to a credit agreement could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we raise funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our platform technologies or products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nThe credit markets and the financial services industry have experienced a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy, failure, collapse, or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United States federal government. These events have generally made equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain. Accordingly, additional equity or debt financing might\nnot be available on reasonable terms, if at all. If we cannot secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more research and development programs or sales and marketing initiatives. In addition, we may have to work with a partner on one or more of our development programs, which could lower the economic value of those programs to us.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management devotes substantial time to public company compliance programs.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses due to our compliance with regulations and disclosure obligations applicable to us, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the SEC, and the NASDAQ Stock Market, or NASDAQ. The SEC and other regulators have continued to adopt new rules and regulations and make additional changes to existing regulations that require our compliance. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that have required the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas. Stockholder activism, the current political environment, and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact, in ways we cannot currently anticipate, the manner in which we operate our business. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance programs and monitoring of public company reporting obligations, and as a result of the new corporate governance and executive compensation related rules, regulations, and guidelines prompted by the Dodd-Frank Act, and further regulations and disclosure obligations expected in the future, we will likely need to devote additional time and costs to comply with such compliance programs and rules. These rules and regulations will cause us to incur significant legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nTo comply with the requirements of being a public company, we may need to undertake various actions, including implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring new accounting or internal audit staff. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate, and weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which we may be required to include in our periodic reports we will file with the SEC under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, or result in a restatement of our prior period financial statements. In the event that we are not able to demonstrate compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, that our internal control over financial reporting is perceived as inadequate, or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our operating results, and the price of our ordinary shares could decline. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.\nWe are required to comply with certain of the SEC rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting commencing with this Annual Report. This assessment needs to include the disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by our management or our independent registered public accounting firm. We are just beginning the costly and challenging process of compiling the\nsystem and processing documentation needed to comply with such requirements. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the first annual report required to be filed with the SEC following the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, depending on whether we choose to rely on certain exemptions set forth in the JOBS Act. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls in the future. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our ordinary shares.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to annual limitations on its ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income or reduce taxes. Our past issuances of stock and other changes in our stock ownership may have resulted in ownership changes within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code; accordingly, our pre-change NOLs may be subject to limitation under Section 382. If we determine that we have not undergone an ownership change, the Internal Revenue Service could challenge our analysis, and our ability to use our NOLs to offset taxable income could be limited by Section 382 of the Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, including in connection with the consummation of the proposed transactions with Roche, could result in ownership changes under Section 382 of the Code further limiting our ability to utilize our NOLs. Furthermore, our ability to use NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. For these reasons, we may not be able to use a material portion of the NOLs, even if we attain profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe expect that our stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThere has been a public market for our common stock for only a short period of time. Although our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, an active public market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nIn addition, the market price of shares of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\ncompetition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us, our biopharmaceutical partners, or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations, or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed financial estimates and projections of the investment community or that we provide to the public;\n\u2022\nissuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key management or scientific personnel;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nchanges to reimbursement levels by commercial third-party payors and government payors, including Medicare, and any announcements relating to reimbursement levels;\n\u2022\nannouncement or expectation of additional debt or equity financing efforts;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us, our insiders, or our other stockholders; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\nThese and other market and industry factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, regardless of our actual operating performance, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, the stock market in general, and NASDAQ and biopharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management.\nOur executive officers, directors, and principal stockholders exercise significant control over our company.\nInvestment funds affiliated with Third Rock Ventures, L.P. and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and Google Ventures 2011, L.P., along with our executive officers and directors, beneficially own, in the aggregate, shares representing approximately 31% of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2014. If these stockholders were to choose to act together, as a result of their stock ownership, they could influence our management and affairs and control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company and might affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and will be able to avail ourselves of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we are electing not to take advantage of such extended transition period, and as a result we will comply with new or\nrevised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to not take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on any of the exemptions available under the JOBS Act. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1.0 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, any gains from an investment in our common stock will likely depend on whether the price of our common stock increases.\nWe have not paid dividends on any of our classes of capital stock to date, and we currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Consequently, in the foreseeable future, you will likely only experience a gain from your investment in our common stock if the price of our common stock increases.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more equity analysts downgrade our common stock or if analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions which could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. Our corporate governance documents include provisions:\n\u2022\ncreating a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nauthorizing \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend, and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings;\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022\ncontrolling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of board of directors and stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nproviding our board of directors with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings and to cancel previously scheduled special meetings.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock.\nAny provision of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nIn the event our proposed transactions with Roche are consummated, effective upon the Closing, our certificate of incorporation will be amended to, among other things, provide for the declassification of our board of directors, and all of our directors would be elected annually and serve one-year terms.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of our certificate of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Strategic Collaboration with Roche\nAs disclosed above under \u201cItem 1. Business-Proposed Strategic Collaboration with Roche,\u201d we and Roche entered into a Transaction Agreement pursuant to which Roche has agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to acquire at least 52.4% and up to approximately 56.3% of our outstanding shares of common stock on a fully-diluted basis at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreement, or the Transactions. In addition, we entered into four separate agreements, each of which will become effective upon the Closing, with certain affiliates of Roche to develop and commercialize comprehensive molecular information and genomic analysis products for the treatment of cancer patients. If approved and the conditions to closing are satisfied, the Transactions are expected to close during the second quarter of 2015.\nThe following discussion highlights some of the potential risks that may arise in connection with the proposed transactions with Roche.\nRoche\u2019s obligation to consummate the Transactions is subject to certain conditions, which if not satisfied may prevent, delay or jeopardize the consummation of the Transactions, result in additional expenditures of money and resources, and/or reduce the anticipated benefits of the Transactions.\nRoche\u2019s obligation to consummate the Transactions is subject to customary closing conditions. These closing conditions include, among others, (a) that there shall have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to the Acceptance Time that number of shares which, when combined with the Issuance Shares and existing shares of our common stock held by Roche Holding Ltd and its subsidiaries, represents at least 52.4% of our outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis, or the Minimum Condition, (b) receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, (c) each of the Collaboration Agreements and the Investor Rights Agreement continuing in full force and effect, (d) the approval of the Issuance Shares for listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, (e) the continued accuracy of our representations and warranties, subject to specified materiality standards, and (f) the performance by us of our covenants and agreements.\nWe cannot predict whether and when these conditions will be satisfied, and no assurance can be given that the required Company Stockholder Approval will be obtained or that the other required closing conditions will be satisfied. In the event that the Transactions are not consummated, we will have spent considerable time and resources, and incurred substantial costs, including costs related to the Transactions, many of which must be paid even if the Transactions are not completed. If the Transactions are not consummated, our reputation in our industry and in the investment community could be damaged and, as a result, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nThe Transaction Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms.\nThe Transaction Agreement contains certain termination rights for both us and Roche, including, among other things, for (a) the failure of the Acceptance Time to occur by October 11, 2015, (b) the enactment, adoption, enforcement, promulgation or application of any final and non-appealable applicable law, order, injunction or judgment that makes the consummation of the Transactions illegal or otherwise prohibited or permanently enjoins either us or Roche from consummating the Transactions, (c) the failure to receive the Company Stockholder Approval, and (d) breaches of representations, warranties or covenants by a party that, in the case of us, result in the failure of certain conditions to closing being satisfied, or, in the case of Roche, would reasonably be expected to prevent Roche from consummating the Transactions. Furthermore, the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Transaction Agreement at any time prior to the consummation of the Transactions.\nThe Transaction Agreement contains provisions that restrict our ability to pursue alternatives to the Transactions and, in specified circumstances, could require us to pay Roche a termination fee of $30 million.\nPursuant to the Transaction Agreement, we are restricted, subject to certain exceptions, from soliciting, initiating or taking any action to knowingly assist, facilitate or encourage the submission of, or furnishing information with regard to a competing acquisition proposal from any person or entity. In the event that we receive an acquisition proposal from another person, we have agreed to notify Roche of such proposal and negotiate in good faith with Roche prior to terminating the Transaction Agreement or effecting a change in the recommendation of our board of directors to our stockholders with respect to the proposed Transactions. Prior to the Acceptance Time, we may terminate the Transaction Agreement in connection with entering into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal with a third party, subject to certain conditions, including our compliance with certain procedures set forth in the Transaction Agreement and payment of a termination fee of $30 million to Roche. These provisions could discourage a third party that may have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of our business from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if such third party were prepared to enter into a transaction that would be more favorable to us and our stockholders than the Transactions. These provisions also might result in a potential third-party acquiror proposing to pay a lower price to our stockholders than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the $30 million termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances.\nIf the Transaction Agreement is terminated and we determine to seek another business combination, we may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the proposed Transactions.\nFailure to complete the Transactions within the expected time frame, or at all, could adversely affect our stock price, financial results and our future business and operations.\nIn the event that the Transactions are not completed or delayed our business may be harmed because:\n\u2022\nmatters related to the proposed Transactions may require substantial commitments of time and resources thereby diverting management\u2019s and our employees\u2019 attention from our day-to-day business, including servicing existing customers, attracting new customers and developing new products and strategies;\n\u2022\nour relationships with customers, distributors, collaborative partners, suppliers and patients may be harmed as a result of the proposed Transactions and result in uncertainties with respect to our products, employees and business;\n\u2022\nour financial performance may be negatively impacted by disruptions in our sales and marketing, research and development, value improvement initiatives, and other business activities;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to retain key employees who have sought and obtained different employment in anticipation of the Transactions being completed;\n\u2022\nwe have agreed to restrict certain of our activities pending the consummation of the Transactions that may negatively affect our ability to execute on our business strategies and attain our financial goals; and\n\u2022\ncertain significant costs related to the proposed Transactions, such as legal, advisor and accounting fees and other expenses, are payable by us whether or not the proposed Transactions are completed, including a termination fee under certain circumstances.\nIf the Transactions are not consummated, the market price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects a positive market assumption that the Transactions will be completed. Our stock price may also fluctuate significantly based on announcements by Roche and other third parties or us regarding the Transactions, or based on market perceptions of the likelihood of us obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. Such announcements may lead to perceptions in the market that the Transactions may not be completed, which could cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline. In addition, if the Transaction Agreement is terminated our stock price could decline significantly.\nAny of these events could harm our results of operations and financial condition and could cause a decline in the price of our common stock, particularly if the Transactions are not completed.\nWhile the Transactions are pending, we will be subject to business uncertainties that could adversely affect our business.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Transactions on employees, customers and suppliers may have an adverse effect on our business. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Transactions are consummated and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers, suppliers and others who deal with us to seek to change their existing business relationships with us. In addition, the Transaction Agreement restricts us from taking specified actions until the Transactions occur without the consent of Roche. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Transactions. In addition, the Transactions could expose us or members of our board of directors to litigation. Any such legal proceedings could delay or prevent the Transactions from becoming effective within the agreed upon timeframe or at all. If closing of the Transactions is delayed or does not occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to the Business of the Company after Consummation of the Transactions and the Collaboration\nWe may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of the Transactions or in the expected time frame.\nThe Transactions may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships, and diversion of management\u2019s attention, including, among others:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated business opportunities and growth prospects;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing the expanded operations of a more complex company;\n\u2022\nchallenges resulting from increased complexities in accounting and tax matters, which could be heightened by potential required or desired changes in our third party accounting or tax service providers or in satisfying accounting practices and procedures required by Roche;\n\u2022\nchallenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers, including any biopharmaceutical customers that are actual or potential competitors with Roche;\n\u2022\nchallenges in our relationships with collaboration partners, suppliers, distributors, and patients; and\n\u2022\nchallenges in attracting and retaining key personnel that may arise from working in a more complex company or due to changes in our equity incentive program that may be adopted to maintain Roche\u2019s percentage ownership interest.\nMany of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if the full benefits of the Transactions are realized, including the sales and growth opportunities that are expected, these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in connection with the Transactions. All of these factors could negatively impact the price of our common stock. As a result, we cannot assure you that the Transactions will result in the realization of the anticipated benefits.\nAs long as Roche owns greater than a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock, other holders of our common stock will have limited ability to influence matters requiring stockholder approval and Roche\u2019s interest may conflict with ours and other stockholders.\nIf the Transactions with Roche are consummated, Roche will beneficially own up to approximately 63% of our outstanding common stock as of the Closing. As a result, until such time as Roche and its affiliates hold shares representing less than a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of our outstanding common stock at a stockholder meeting, Roche generally will have the ability to control the outcome of any matter submitted for the vote of our stockholders, except in certain circumstances set forth in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and the Investor Rights Agreement.\nThe interests of Roche may not coincide with the interests of our other stockholders. Roche\u2019s ability, subject to the limitations in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and the Investor Rights Agreement, to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval limits the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial. As a result, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. In addition, the existence of a controlling stockholder may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discouraging a third party from seeking to acquire, our business. A third party would be required to negotiate any such transaction with Roche, and the interests of Roche with respect to such transaction may be different from the interests of our other stockholders. In addition, the performance of Roche or speculation about the possibility of future actions Roche may take in connection with us may adversely affect our share price.\nWe have entered into contractual provisions that may significantly limit our ability to conduct certain operations, raise capital or require us to make material expenditures.\nPursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, until such time as Roche and its affiliates beneficially owns less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock (subject to a cure period), we may not take certain actions without Roche\u2019s prior written consent, including any of the following: (a) appoint a new Chief Executive Officer; (b) incur any indebtedness (as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement) that would result in the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries exceeding the lesser of (A) $200 million and (B) 20% of the Company\u2019s aggregate market capitalization at the time of such incurrence; (c) issue or sell any equity securities (including any securities convertible or exercisable into such equity securities), other than (X) common stock issued upon the exercise or settlement of equity awards granted as of the date of the Investor Rights Agreement in accordance with their terms, (Y) equity awards granted after the date of the Investor Rights Agreement pursuant to our 2013 Stock Option and Incentive Plan or any permitted new equity incentive plan or equity incentive plan amendment and (Z) in connection with permitted acquisitions, certain shares of our common stock issued as stock consideration as long as such issuance does not result in Roche beneficially owning less than 50.5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock on a fully diluted basis; (d) establish or amend any of our equity incentive plans, except for certain permitted equity incentive plans and permitted equity incentive plan amendments; (e) acquire any entity, business or assets if the aggregate consideration payable by us exceeds the lesser of (X) $200 million and (Y) 20% of our aggregate market capitalization at the time of such transaction, unless Roche is separately contemplating acquiring the same entity, business or assets; (f) dispose of any entity, business or assets if the aggregate consideration payable to us exceeds $50 million; (g) change the scope and nature of our business; (h) amend our organizational documents; (i) take any action that would impair in any material respect our ability to perform our obligations under the Investor Rights Agreement or Roche\u2019s rights thereunder; or (j) voluntarily dissolve or liquidate or make any voluntary bankruptcy filings. If we are unable to complete any of these actions because Roche does not provide its consent, it could adversely impact and our business and results of operations.\nThe Investor Rights Agreement also requires us to establish and maintain a stock repurchase program at all times following the Closing and to repurchase shares of our common stock in order to maintain Roche\u2019s aggregate percentage ownership following the Issuance at no less than 50.5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock on a fully diluted basis, less any shares transferred by Roche. Our obligation to maintain such stock repurchase program may involve material expenditures of cash by us. If we fail to or are unable to satisfy our repurchase obligations under the stock repurchase program and we issue any securities and, as a result thereof, Roche beneficially owns less than 50.1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock on a fully diluted basis, the restrictions on Roche under the Investor Rights Agreement (including with respect to the agreement to vote Roche\u2019s shares of common stock, the standstill restrictions and the transfer restrictions), but not the rights of Roche under the Investor Rights Agreement, will immediately terminate, and Roche will thereafter have the ability to exercise in full its rights as a stockholder.\nIn addition, the Transaction Agreement provides for us to indemnify Roche for breaches of the Transaction Agreement by us subject to negotiated limitations. If we are required to indemnify Roche for any such breaches, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nThe Transactions with Roche will modify our investor composition and could have a material negative impact on the liquidity of our common stock.\nFollowing the Transactions, Roche will own a minimum of 52.4% and a maximum of 56.3% of our Company on a fully diluted basis, or up to approximately 63% of our outstanding shares of common stock. In addition, the Investor Rights Agreement contains provisions that enable Roche to maintain its percentage ownership interest in our common stock and require us to establish a stock repurchase program designed to maintain Roche\u2019s percentage ownership interest in our common stock. This ownership and these provisions will result in changes in the ownership levels of our most significant shareholders and will likely result in a less liquid\ntrading market for our shares. This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult for investors to transact in our shares and the price of our stock may suffer as a result.", "PERMNO": 14160, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "FMI"}
