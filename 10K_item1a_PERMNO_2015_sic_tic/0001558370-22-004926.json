{"cik": "1679063", "company": "Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nUnless the context otherwise requires, references herein to VOD include both our AVOD and FAST streaming services.\nRisks Relating to COVID-19\nOur business, results of operations, and financial condition may be impacted by the evolution of the coronavirus (COVID-19).\nThe global spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and the various attempts to contain it created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption in 2021. In response to government mandates, health care advisories, and employee and vendor concerns, we altered certain aspects of our operations during the pandemic, including implementing a work from home policy for all our employees. We are now engaged in a \u201creturn to office\u201d program under which our employees are returning to our offices for most work days. It is possible, however, that currently improving Covid-related conditions reverse course, including as result of the emergence of new strains of the virus, which could force us to return to remote operations in whole or part. Although we believe we transitioned our operations to handle remote working conditions efficiently, requirements to implement remote working policies in the future could adversely impact our productivity and the internal controls over our operations.\nAlthough our operations have been returning to normal conditions, our business and results were affected in 2021 by COVID-19 and our financial results and metrics may not be indicative of results for future periods. In addition to production delays experienced by our company and third-party producers, we also saw material decreases, for a time, in advertising expenditures as a result of general economic conditions. At the same time, we experienced increases in our user base during the height of the pandemic. Our increase in user additions may reflect the acceleration of our growth that we would have seen in subsequent periods or it may have resulted, in part, from more people remaining indoors during the pandemic. Although we continually seek to build and retain our user base through the introduction of new content and improved user experiences, user growth could slow or reverse as government and other restrictions are relaxed.\nAny resurgence of COVID-19, including variants thereof, or an outbreak of other highly contagious viruses, could disrupt our business in material ways, including disruptions similar to those experienced during the pandemic as well as additional disruptions. During the pandemic, from time to time, the production of our content by our company and third-party producers was halted or slowed, limiting our ability to introduce new content as previously scheduled. To the extent any future economic disruption resulting from COVID-19 or similar pandemics is severe, we could see some vendors go out of business, resulting in supply constraints and increased costs or delays to our productions. Such production pauses may cause us temporarily to have less new content available on our service in subsequent quarters, which could negatively impact consumer demand for and user retention to our service. Temporary production pauses or permanent shutdowns in production could result in content asset impairments or other charges and will change the timing and amount of cash outflows associated with production activity.\nThe full extent to which any future or continued outbreaks of COVID-19 or other viruses impact our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the availability and cost to access the capital markets; the effect on our customers and customer demand for our services; disruptions or restrictions on our employees\u2019 ability to work and travel; our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel as a result of increased competition for such personnel; our ability to access resources, including technology related resources needed for maintenance, modification, and improvement of our platforms, in the face of supply scarcity and supply pipeline delays; interruptions or restrictions related to the provision of streaming services over the internet, including impacts on content delivery networks and streaming quality; and any stoppages, disruptions or increased costs associated with our development, production, post-production, marketing and distribution of original programming.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past, may incur operating losses in the future, and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had an deficit of approximately $136.5 and $77.2 million, respectively, and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had a net loss of approximately $59.4 and $44.6 million, respectively. We expect our operating expenses to increase in the future as we continue to expand our operations. If our revenue and gross profit do not grow at a greater rate than our operating expenses, we will not be able to achieve and maintain profitability. Although we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, cash dividend payments on our 9.75% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d), and cash interest payments on our outstanding publicly traded notes (\u201cNotes\u201d), credit facilities, and other debt obligations, there can be no assurance that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to service our debt, which may require us to borrow additional funds for that purpose, restructure or otherwise refinance our debt. Additionally, we may encounter unforeseen operating or legal expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other factors that may result in losses in future periods. If our expenses exceed our revenue, we may never achieve or maintain profitability and some or all aspects of our business operations may need to be modified or curtailed.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations.\nOur ability to make payments on our debt, including our cash dividend payments on our Series A Preferred Stock, and interest payments on our outstanding Notes, our credit facilities, and our other debt obligations, will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to attain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay all of our obligations as and when due.\nIf we are unable to service our debt and other obligations from cash flows, we may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of such obligations prior to maturity. Our ability to refinance or restructure our debt and other obligations will depend upon the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing or restructuring could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. If our cash flows are insufficient to service our debt and other obligations, we may not be able to refinance or restructure any of these obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all and any refinancing or restructuring could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIf our cash flows are insufficient to fund our debt and other obligations, and we are unable to refinance or restructure these obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments or to sell material assets or operations to meet our debt and other obligations. We cannot assure you that we would be able to implement any of these alternative measures on satisfactory terms or at all or that the proceeds from such alternatives would be adequate to meet any debt or other obligations then due. If it becomes necessary to implement any of these alternative measures, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not realize the advantages we expect from our acquisitions.\nPart of our growth strategy has been and will continue to be the acquisition of scalable assets to build our business. Our relatively recent acquisitions of the assets of Crackle, Sonar, 1091 Pictures and others, require time-consuming and costly integration efforts. We may not be successful in the efficient integration of assets into our operations as we acquire them, and may not realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions. As we grow as a result of acquisitions, we will need to hire additional qualified personnel and may need to secure additional debt or equity financing to fund all or a portion of the cost of acquisitions or the post-closing integration and operation of these assets. The incurrence of additional debt or issuance of additional equity would result in additional leverage of our company and dilution of ownership interests therein. Our operating results may fluctuate form period to period due to the costs and expenses of acquiring and managing our acquisitions.\nWe are subject to numerous other risks associated with acquisitions, business combinations, or joint ventures.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we regularly engage in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions, sale of assets, business combinations, and joint ventures intended to complement or expand our business, some of which may be significant transactions for us. Regardless of whether we consummate any such transaction, the negotiation of a potential transaction could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of management\u2019s time and resources.\nIntegrating any business that we acquire may be distracting to our management and disruptive to our business and may result in significant costs to us. We could face several challenges in the consolidation and integration of information technology, accounting systems, personnel and operations. Any such transaction could also result in impairment of goodwill and other intangibles, development write-offs and other related expenses. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nIf our efforts to attract and retain VOD viewers are not successful, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on attracting viewers, retaining them on our VOD services, and ultimately monetizing our VOD services and content offerings. As such, we are seeking to expand our viewer base and increase the number of hours that are streamed across our platforms to create additional revenue opportunities. To attract and retain viewers, we need to be able to respond efficiently to changes in consumer tastes and preferences and to offer our viewers access to the content they enjoy on terms that they accept. Effective monetization may require us to continue to update the features and functionality of our VOD offerings for viewers and advertisers.\nOur ability to attract viewers will depend in part on our ability to effectively market our services, as well as provide a quality experience for selecting and viewing TV series and movies. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors as compared to our service will determine our ability to attract and retain viewers. Competitors include other streaming entertainment providers, including those that provide AVOD and SVOD offerings, and other direct-to-consumer video distributors and more broadly other sources of entertainment that our viewers could choose in their moments of free time. If consumers do not perceive our service offerings to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain consumers. In addition, many of our consumers originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing viewers. If we do not grow as expected, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing viewers and attracting new viewers, our business may be adversely affected.\nChanges in competitive offerings for entertainment video could adversely impact our business.\nThe market for entertainment video is subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, and ad-supported models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet-based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their streaming video offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content and significant financial, marketing and other resources. Competitors may secure better terms from content suppliers and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. Our competitors also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors, our business may be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability.\nOur long-term results of operations are difficult to predict and depend on the commercial success of our VOD platforms as well as successful monetization of our video content in other ways and the continued strength of the Chicken Soup for the Soul Brand.\nVideo streaming is a rapidly evolving industry, making our business and prospects difficult to evaluate. The growth and profitability of this industry and the level of demand and market acceptance for our VOD platforms and content offerings are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. We believe that the continued growth of streaming as an entertainment alternative will depend on the availability and growth of cost-effective broadband internet access, the quality of broadband content delivery, the quality and reliability of new devices and technology, the cost for viewers relative to other sources of content, as well as the quality and breadth of content that is delivered across streaming platforms. These technologies, products and content offerings continue to emerge and evolve. In addition, many advertisers continue to devote a substantial portion of their advertising budgets to traditional advertising, such as linear TV, radio and print. The future growth of our business depends on the growth of digital advertising, and on advertisers increasing their spend on such advertising. We cannot be certain that they will do so. If advertisers do not perceive meaningful benefits of digital advertising, the market may develop more slowly than we expect, which could adversely impact our operating results and our ability to grow our business.\nIn addition, monetization of content that we produce and acquire from sources other than our AVOD network is an essential element of our strategy. Our ability in the long-term to obtain sponsorships, licensing arrangements, co-productions and tax credits and to distribute our original programming and acquired video content will depend, in part, upon the commercial success of the content that we initially produce and distribute and, in part, on the continued strength of the Chicken Soup for the Soul brand (the \u201cBrand\u201d). We cannot ensure that we will produce, acquire, and distribute successful content. The continued strength of the Brand will be affected in large part by the operations of our parent company, Chicken Soup for the Soul, LLC (\u201cCSS\u201d), the owner of the Brand, and its other business operations, none of which we control. CSS utilizes the Brand through its other subsidiaries for various commercial purposes, including the sale of books (including educational curriculum products), pet foods and other consumer products. Negative publicity relating to CSS or its other subsidiaries or the brand, or any diminution in the perception of the Brand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects. We cannot assure you that we will manage the production and distribution of all of our video content successfully, that all or any portion of our video content will be met with critical acclaim or will be embraced by audiences on a one-time or repeated basis, or that the strength of the Brand will not diminish over time.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to further monetize our VOD services\nOur AVOD platforms generate revenue primarily from digital advertising and audience development campaigns that run across our streaming platform and from content distribution services. Our ability to deliver more relevant advertisements to our viewers and to increase our platform\u2019s value to advertisers and content publishers depends on the collection of user engagement data, which may be restricted or prevented by a number of factors. Viewers may decide to opt out or restrict our ability to collect personal viewing data or to provide them with more relevant advertisements. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, growth in our revenue from advertising, our efforts to monetize our streaming platform through the distribution of AVOD content are still developing and our advertising revenue may not grow as we expect. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in monetizing our streaming platform through the distribution of ad-supported content.\nIn addition, with the recent spread of the coronavirus throughout the United States and the rest of the world, companies advertising plans and amounts available for advertising may be significantly restricted or discontinued which could also impact our ability to monetize our AVOD platform.\nOur reliance on third parties for content, production and distribution could limit our control over the quality of the finished video content.\nWe currently have limited production capabilities and rely on relationships with third parties for much of these capabilities. Working with third parties is an integral part of our strategy to produce video content on a cost-efficient basis, and our reliance on such third parties could lessen the control we have over the projects. Should the third-party producers we rely\nupon not produce completed projects to the standards we expect and desire, critical and audience acceptance of such projects could suffer, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to produce and distribute future projects. In particular, due to the global spread of COVID-19, and in response to government mandates and healthcare advisories, we experienced delays in new content delivery as certain of our vendors and partners halted or diminished their operations. Further, during any continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic or after it fully subsides, we cannot be assured of entering into favorable agreements with third-party content producers on economically favorable terms or on terms that provide us with satisfactory intellectual property rights in the completed projects.\nAn integral part of our strategy is to initially minimize our production, content acquisition and distribution costs by utilizing funding sources provided by others, however, such sources may not be readily available.\nThe production acquisition and distribution of video content can require a significant amount of capital. As part of our strategy, we seek to fund the production, content acquisition, and distribution of our video content through co-productions, tax credits, film acquisition advances, upfront fees from sponsors, licensors, broadcasters, cable and satellite outlets and other producers and distributors, as well as through other initiatives. Such funding from the aforementioned sources or other sources may not be available on attractive terms or at all, as and when we need such funding. To the extent we are not able to secure agreements of this sort, we may need to curtail the amount of video content being produced or acquired by us or use our operating or other funds to pay for such video content, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects. Due to the effect of the coronavirus, sponsors may not have the interest or ability to enter into and invest in co-production agreements on terms that are attractive to the Company or at all.\nAs we grow, we may seek to fund and produce more of our video content directly, subjecting us to significant additional risks.\nOur current strategy of funding the production, acquisition, and distribution of our video content through the payment of upfront fees by third parties may limit the backend return to us. If we should determine to use our own funds to produce, acquire, and distribute more of our video content in order to capture greater backend returns, we would face significant additional risks, such as the need to internally advance funds ahead of revenue generation and cost recoupment and the need to divert some of our resources and efforts away from other operations. In order to reduce these risks, we may determine to raise additional equity or incur additional indebtedness. In such event, our stockholders and our Company will be subjected to the risks associated with issuing more equity or increasing our debt obligations.\nIf studios, content providers or other rights holders are unable or refuse to license content or other rights upon terms acceptable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to provide content depends on studios, content providers and other rights holders licensing rights to distribute such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of music contained within the content we distribute. If studios, content providers and other rights holders are not or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to provide content will be adversely affected and/or our costs could increase. Increasingly, studios and other content providers have been developing their own streaming services, and may be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content so that they can give exclusive access to their own streaming services. Under a limited number of our license agreements, content owners can withdraw content from us relatively quickly and with short notice. If we do not maintain content that our viewers are interested in, our viewership may decrease and our business could be adversely effected.\nCertain conflicts of interest may arise between us and our affiliated companies and we have waived certain rights with respect thereto.\nOur certificate of incorporation includes a provision stating that we renounce any interest or expectancy in any business opportunities that are presented to us or our officers, directors or stockholders or affiliates thereof, except as may be set forth in any written agreement between us and any of the CSS Companies (such as the CSS License Agreement under which CSS has agreed that all video content operations shall be conducted only through our company). This provision also states that, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, our officers, directors and employees shall not be liable to us\nor our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of any of our activities or any activities of any of the CSS Companies. As a result of these provisions, there may be conflicts of interest among us and our officers, directors, stockholders or their affiliates, including the CSS Companies, relating to business opportunities, and we have waived our right to monetary damages in the event of any such conflict.\nWe are required to make continuing payments to our affiliates, which may reduce our cash flow and profits.\nIn consideration for use of the Brand, and the provisions of key operational resources to our company, we are required to make significant payments to our affiliates as described under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Related Party Resources and Obligations\u201d in this Form 10-K. Accordingly, in the aggregate, 10% of our net revenue is paid to our affiliates on a continuous basis and will not be otherwise available to us. As we grow our revenues, these payments could become materially more costly than building and acquiring the same resources directly within our company. Similarly, as we build our business and operations in areas outside of the Brand, the value received from licensing the Brand could diminish on absolute and relative terms.\nIf a project we are producing incurs substantial budget overruns, we may have to seek additional financing from outside sources to complete production or fund the overrun ourselves.\nIf a production we are funding incurs substantial budget overruns, we may have to seek additional financing from outside sources to complete production or fund the overrun ourselves. We cannot be certain that any required financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that we will be able to recoup the costs of overruns. Increased costs incurred with respect to a project may result in the production not being ready for release at the intended time, which could cause a decline in the commercial performance of the project. Budget overruns could also prevent a project from being completed or released at all and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur operating results may fluctuate.\nOur operating results are dependent, in part, on management\u2019s estimates of revenue to be earned over the life of a project. We will regularly review and revise our revenue estimates. This review may result in a change in the rate of amortization and/or a write-down of the video content asset to its estimated realizable value. Results of operations in future years depend upon our amortization of our video content costs. Periodic adjustments in amortization rates may significantly affect these results. Further, as many of our third-party relationships will be on a project-by-project basis, the profits, if any, generated from various projects will fluctuate based on the terms of the agreements between us and our third-party producers and distributors.\nVariations in our quarterly and year-end operating results are difficult to predict and our income and cash flows may fluctuate significantly from period to period, which may impact our board of directors\u2019 willingness or legal ability to declare and pay the dividends on our preferred stock. Specific factors that may cause fluctuations in our operating results include:\n\u25cf demand and pricing for our products and services;\n\u25cf introduction of competing products;\n\u25cf our operating expenses which fluctuate due to growth of our business;\n\u25cf timing and popularity of new video content offerings and changes in viewing habits or the emergence of new content distribution platforms;\n\u25cf variable sales cycle and implementation periods for content and services; and\n\u25cf the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and governmental responses thereto.\nAs a result of the foregoing and other factors, our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period, and the results of any one period may not be indicative of the results for any future period.\nDistributors\u2019 failure to promote our video content could adversely affect our revenue and could adversely affect our business results.\nWe will not always control the timing and way in which the distributors to which we license our content will distribute our video content offerings. However, their decisions regarding the timing of release and promotional support are important in determining our success. Any decision by those distributors not to distribute or promote our video content or to promote our competitors\u2019 video content to a greater extent than they promote our content could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nWe are smaller and less diversified than many of our competitors.\nSome of the AVOD services, and many of the producers and studios, with which we compete are part of large diversified corporate groups with a variety of other operations, including television networks, cable channels and other diversified companies, such as Amazon or Apple, which can provide both the means of distributing their products, content flow, and stable sources of earnings that may allow them to better offset fluctuations in the financial performance of their operations. In addition, the major studios have more resources with which to compete for ideas, storylines and scripts created by third parties as well as for actors, and other personnel required for production. The resources of the major producers and studios may also give them an advantage in acquiring other businesses or assets, including video content libraries, that we might also be interested in acquiring.\nWe face risks from doing business internationally.\nWe intend to increase the distribution of our video content outside the U.S. and thereby derive significant revenue in foreign jurisdictions. As a result, our business is subject to certain risks inherent in international business, many of which are beyond our control. These risks include:\n\u25cf laws and policies affecting trade, investment and taxes, including laws and policies relating to the repatriation of funds and withholding taxes, and changes in these laws;\n\u25cf the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws regulating interactions and dealings with foreign government officials;\n\u25cf changes in local regulatory requirements, including restrictions on video content;\n\u25cf differing and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws;\n\u25cf differing degrees of protection for intellectual property;\n\u25cf financial instability and increased market concentration of buyers in foreign television markets;\n\u25cf the instability of foreign economies and governments;\n\u25cf fluctuating currencies and foreign exchange rates;\n\u25cf the spread of communicable diseases, including COVID-19, in such jurisdictions, and government responses to contain the spread of such diseases, including border closures, stay-at-home orders and quarantines, which may impact business in such jurisdictions; and\n\u25cf war and acts of terrorism.\nEvents or developments related to these and other risks associated with international trade could adversely affect our revenue from non-U.S. sources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nThe effects on our business of the war in Ukraine, or the direct military involvement of the United States in such conflict, or any similar conflicts anywhere in the world, and the ramifications of sanctions against Russia or other counties, are unknown and could be material.\nOur business could be materially affected by hostilities in other countries. Adverse effects could arise from reduced viewership in our international content offerings, disruptions in Internet availability, heightened risks of cyberattacks perpetrated by government actors, or slow downs or halts in the production of content being created in other countries. The effects on our business of any specific conflicts, including the current war in Ukraine and any escalation of such war to neighboring countries, or the direct military involvement of the United States in such conflict, or any similar conflicts anywhere in the world, cannot be predicted, but could be material and adverse. Direct US military involvement could heighten international and other risks we already face. Similarly the ramifications of sanctions put in place by the United States against Russia or other counties on our business are unknown and could be material. Our business could be harmed by retaliatory sanctions or actions taken by a country in response to US sanctions, and significant as a result of numerous circumstances arising from same, including prohibitions on the dissemination of US-based video services in certain countries, military actions, cyber-attack initiatives, and other measures that cannot be predicted.\nProtecting and defending against intellectual property claims may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to compete depends, in part, upon successful protection of our intellectual property relating to our video content, including our copyrighted content, and the protection of the Chicken Soup for the Soul brand. We protect proprietary and intellectual property rights to our productions through available copyright and trademark laws and licensing and distribution arrangements with reputable international companies in specific territories and media. Under the terms of the CSS License Agreement, CSS has the primary right to take actions to protect the Brand, and, if it does not, and we reasonably deem any infringement thereof is materially harmful to our business, we may elect to seek action to protect the Brand ourselves. Although in the former case, we would equitably share in any recovery, and in the latter case, we would retain the entirety of any recovery, should CSS determine not to prosecute infringement of the Brand, we could be materially harmed and could incur substantial cost in prosecuting an infringement of the Chicken Soup for the Soul brand.\nOthers may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us.\nIt is possible that others may claim from time to time that our productions and production techniques misappropriate or infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties with respect to their previously developed content, stories, characters and other entertainment or intellectual property. Additionally, although CSS is obligated to indemnify us for claims related to our use of the Chicken Soup for the Soul brand in accordance with the CSS License Agreement, we could face lawsuits with respect to claims relating thereto. Irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of any such claims, we could incur significant costs and diversion of resources in defending against them, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nOur business involves risks of liability claims for video content, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a producer and distributor of video content, we may face potential liability for defamation, invasion of privacy, negligence and other claims based on the nature and content of the materials distributed. These types of claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against producers and distributors of video content. Any imposition of liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nPiracy of video content may harm our business.\nVideo content piracy is extensive in many parts of the world, including South America, Asia, and certain Eastern European countries, and is made easier by technological advances and the conversion of video content into digital formats. This trend facilitates the creation, transmission and sharing of high-quality unauthorized copies of video content on DVDs, Blu-ray discs, from pay-per-view through set-top boxes and other devices and through unlicensed broadcasts on free television and the internet. The proliferation of unauthorized copies of our video content could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAny significant disruption in our technology backbone or the computer and data systems of third parties that we utilize in our operations could result in a loss or degradation of service and could adversely impact our business.\nOur business involves 24-hour per day availability and delivery of video content. We utilize proprietary and third-party computer and data systems for the storage and delivery of our content, placement and delivery of our advertising inventory, and the creation of the user experience. Our reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our viewers is dependent upon the reliable performance of these computer and data systems. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm these systems. Interruptions in these systems or to the internet in general, could make our content unavailable or impair our ability to deliver such content.\nOur online activities are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to privacy, which, if violated, could limit our ability to collect and use customer data and subject us to an increased risk of litigation and regulatory actions.\nIn addition to our websites, we use third-party applications, websites, and social media platforms to promote our video content offerings and engage consumers, as well as monitor and collect certain information about consumers. There are a variety of laws and regulations governing individual privacy and the protection and use of information collected from such individuals, particularly in relation to an individual\u2019s personally identifiable information. Laws relating to data privacy and security continue to proliferate, often with little harmonization between jurisdictions and limited guidance. A number of existing bills are pending in the U.S. Congress and other government bodies that contain provisions that would regulate, how companies can use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect, use and share user information. The United States is seeing the adoption of state-level laws governing individual privacy. This includes the California Consumer Protection Act, Massachusetts General Law 93H and regulations adopted thereunder, and the New York SHIELD Act. Many foreign countries and supranational organizations have adopted similar laws governing individual privacy, such as the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), some of which are more restrictive than similar United States laws. If our online activities or the activities of the third parties that we work with were to violate any applicable current or future laws and regulations that limit our ability to collect, transfer, and use data, we could be subject to litigation from both private rights of action, class action lawsuits, and regulatory actions, including fines and other penalties. Internationally, we may become subject to evolving, additional and/or more stringent legal obligations concerning our treatment of customer and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localization and/or restrictions on data export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability and/or reputational damage, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt to these obligations, we could incur additional expenses.\nIf government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change, we may need to alter the way we conduct our business or incur greater operating expenses.\nThe adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the way we currently conduct our business. In addition, the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional burdens on us such as the EU\u2019s GDPR. If we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our operations.\nIf we experience rapid growth, we may not manage our growth effectively, execute our business plan as proposed or adequately address competitive challenges.\nWe anticipate continuing to grow our business and operations rapidly. Our growth strategy includes organic initiatives and acquisitions. Such growth could place a significant strain on the management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure we utilize, a portion of which is made available to us by our affiliates under the Management Agreement. Our long-term success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage this growth effectively, obtain the necessary support and resources under the CSS Management Agreement, and grow our own internal resources as required, including internal management and staff personnel. To manage the continued growth of our operations and personnel, we also will need to increase our internal operational, financial and management controls, and our reporting systems and procedures. Failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulty or delays in producing our video content, declines in overall project quality and increases in costs. Any of these difficulties could adversely impact our business financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nOur exclusive license to use the Chicken Soup for the Soul Brand could be terminated in certain circumstances.\nWe do not own the Chicken Soup for the Soul Brand. The Brand is licensed to us by CSS under the terms of the CSS License Agreement. CSS controls the Brand, and the continued integrity and strength of the Chicken Soup for the Soul Brand will depend in large part on the efforts and businesses of CSS and how the Brand is used, promoted and protected by CSS, which will be outside of the immediate control of our Company. Although the license granted to us under the CSS License Agreement is perpetual, it may be terminated by CSS upon the cessation of our business, our bankruptcy, liquidation, or insolvency, or if we fail to pay any sums due or otherwise fail to perform under the License Agreement within 30 days following delivery of a second written notice by CSS.\nWe may not be able to realize the entire book value of goodwill and other intangible assets from our acquisitions.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had net intangible assets of $30.2 million and $31.5 million, respectively, and goodwill of $40.0 million and $21.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, primarily related to the formation of Crackle Plus, the acquisition of the Crackle assets, Sonar assets and other acquisitions. We assess goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually and more frequently if certain events or circumstances warrant. If the book value of goodwill or other intangible assets is impaired, any such impairment would be charged to earnings in the period of impairment. If we determine that goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClaims against us relating to any acquisition or business combination may necessitate our seeking claims against the seller for which the seller may not indemnify us or that may exceed the seller\u2019s indemnification obligations.\nThere may be liabilities assumed in any acquisition or business combination that we did not discover or that we underestimated in the course of performing our due diligence. Although a seller generally may have indemnification obligations to us under an acquisition or merger agreement, these obligations usually will be subject to financial limitations, such as general deductibles and maximum recovery amounts, as well as time limitations. In certain circumstances we obtain representation and warranties insurance related to our acquisitions, but these too have limitations and conditions that could prevent recovery in certain circumstances. We cannot assure you that our right to indemnification from any seller will be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the amount of any unknown or underestimated liabilities that we may incur. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nWe may require and not be able to obtain additional funding and may be unable to raise such funding when needed, which could force us to delay, reduce, eliminate, or abandon growth initiatives.\nWe intend to continue making investments to support the growth of our business, including organic growth and growth through acquisitions. Our ability to grow through acquisitions, business combinations and joint ventures, and our ability to fund our operating expenses after one or more acquisitions may depend upon our ability to obtain funds through equity financing, debt financing (including credit facilities), or the sale or syndication of some or all of our interests in certain\nprojects or other assets or businesses. Our issuance of additional debt instruments or the sale of preferred stock could result in the imposition of operational limitations and other covenants and payment obligations (in addition to those we already have in place), any of which may be burdensome to us and may have a material adverse impact on our ability to implement our business plan as currently formulated. The sale of equity securities, including common or preferred stock, may result in dilution to the current stockholders\u2019 ownership and may be limited by the number of shares we have authorized and available for issuance. If we do not have access to financing arrangements, and if funds do not become available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, we may have to delay, reduce, eliminate, or abandon certain aspects of our business plan, including planned acquisitions. We may also have to reduce our licensing, marketing, customer support or other core business services. Such actions could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nOur success depends on our management and relationships with our affiliated companies.\nOur success depends to a significant extent on the performance of our management personnel and key employees, including production and creative personnel, made available to us through the CSS Management Agreement. The loss of the services of such persons or the resources supplied to us by our affiliated companies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nTo be successful, we need to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nOur success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train and retain qualified professional, creative, technical and managerial personnel. Competition for the caliber of talent required to produce and distribute our video content continues to increase, and for certain personnel has become extremely difficult during the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in identifying, attracting, hiring, training and retaining such personnel in the future. If we were unable to hire, assimilate and retain qualified personnel in the future, such inability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nSince our content is digitally stored and distributed online, and we accept online payments for various subscription services, we face numerous cybersecurity risks.\nWe utilize information technology systems, including third-party hosted servers and cloud-based servers, to host our digital content, as well as to keep business, financial, and corporate records, communicate internally and externally, and operate other critical functions. If any of our internal systems or the systems of our third-party providers are compromised due to computer virus, unauthorized access, malware, and the like, then sensitive documents could be exposed or deleted, and our ability to conduct business could be impaired.\nCyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, unauthorized access to our systems, computer viruses or other malicious code, denial of service attacks, malware, ransomware, phishing, SQL injection attacks, human error, or other events that result in security breaches or give rise to the manipulation or loss of sensitive information or assets. Cyber incidents can be caused by various persons or groups, including disgruntled employees and vendors, activists, organized crime groups, and state-sponsored and individual hackers. Cyber incidents can also be caused or aggravated by natural events, such as earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, and telecommunications failures.\nTo date, we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, or other systems failures. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of data maintained in our information systems, it is possible that our security measures will not be able to prevent the systems\u2019 improper functioning or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information, such as in the event of cyber-attacks. In addition to operational and business consequences, if our cybersecurity is breached, we could be held liable to our customers or other parties in regulatory or other actions, and we may be exposed to reputation damages and loss of trust and business. This could result in costly investigations and litigation, civil or criminal penalties, fines, and negative publicity.\nCertain information relating to our customers, including personally identifiable information and credit card numbers, is collected and maintained by us, or by third parties that do business with us or facilitate our business activities. This\ninformation is maintained for a period of time for various business purposes, including maintaining records of customer preferences to enhance our customer service and for billing, marketing, and promotional purposes. We also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees. The integrity and protection of our customer, employee and company data is critical to our business. Our customers and our employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information, and the regulations applicable to security and privacy are increasingly demanding. Privacy regulation is an evolving area and compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs or adversely impact our ability to service our customers and market our properties and services.\nThe occurrence of natural or man-made disasters could result in declines in business that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, landslides, tornadoes, typhoons, tsunamis, hailstorms, explosions, climate events or weather patterns and pandemic health events (such as the recent pandemic spread of the novel corona virus known as COVID-19 virus, duration and full effects of which are still uncertain), as well as man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism, military actions, cyber-terrorism, explosions and biological, chemical or radiological events. The continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, and a natural or man-made disaster could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These consequences could, among other things, result in a decline in business. Disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure, including communications and financial services, which could disrupt our normal business operations. A natural or man-made disaster also could disrupt the operations of our partners and counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our securities less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, as defined in the JOBS Act, and we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our securities less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock, Series A Preferred Stock, and publicly traded notes and the trading price of such securities may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is not an emerging growth company difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nWe will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, although we will lose that status sooner if our revenue exceeds $1.07 billion, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, or if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30 of any year.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought\nonly in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware (or if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another state court located within the State of Delaware, or if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the State of Delaware and to service of process on such stockholder\u2019s counsel. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our certificate of incorporation.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers or employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. We cannot be certain that a court will decide that this provision is either applicable or enforceable, and if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the exclusive forum provision is applicable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, we anticipate that the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction and the exclusive forum provision is not intended to waive our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder or bar claims properly brought thereunder.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nOur Common Stock\nOur chairman and chief executive officer effectively controls our Company.\nWe have two classes of common stock - Class A Common Stock, each share of which entitles the holder thereof to one vote on any matter submitted to our stockholders, and Class B Common Stock, each share of which entitles the holder thereof to ten votes on any matter submitted to our stockholders. Our chairman and chief executive officer, William J. Rouhana, Jr., has control over the vast majority of all the outstanding voting power as represented by our outstanding Class B and Class A Common Stock and effectively controls CSS Holdings and CSS, which controls CSS Productions, and, in turn, our Company. Further, our bylaws provide that any member of our board may be removed with or without cause by the majority of our outstanding voting power, thus Mr. Rouhana exerts significant control over our board. This concentration of ownership and decision making may make it more difficult for other stockholders to effect substantial changes in our Company and may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or expediting, as the case may be, a change in control of our Company.\nA substantial number of shares of our Class A Common Stock may be issued upon exercise of outstanding warrants, which could adversely affect the price of our publicly traded securities.\nA substantial number of shares of Class A Common Stock may be issued upon the exercise of outstanding warrants, including the following:\n\u25cf Class W Warrants, exercisable for up to an aggregate of 526,362 shares of Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $7.50 per share;\n\u25cf Class Z Warrants, exercisable for up to an aggregate of 123,109 shares of Class A Common Stock at a price of $12.00 per share;\n\u25cf Class I Warrants, exercisable for up to an aggregate of 800,000 shares of our Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $8.13 per share;\n\u25cf Class II Warrants, exercisable for up to an aggregate of 1,200,000 shares of our Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $9.67 per share;\n\u25cf Class III-A Warrants, exercisable for up to an aggregate of 380,000 shares of our Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.61 per share;\n\u00b7\nClass III-B Warrants, exercisable for up to an aggregate of 1,620,000 shares of our Class A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.61 per share.\nIf all of the outstanding warrants are exercised for cash we will be required to issue an aggregate of 4,649,471 shares of Class A Common Stock, or approximately 60% of our Class A Common Stock outstanding as of March 30, 2022. The warrant holders will likely exercise the warrants only at a time when it is economically beneficial to do so. Accordingly, the exercise of these warrants will significantly dilute our other equity holders and may adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities.\nWe utilize At the Market Issuance Sales Agreements, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of Class A Common Stock and shares of Series A Preferred Stock, which may adversely affect the price of our Class A Common Stock and series A Preferred Stock .\nWe utilize At the Market Issuance Sales Agreement (\u201cATM Agreements\u201d) pursuant to which we may issue shares of Class A Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $1,000,000,000. The sale of Class A Common Stock will dilute our other equity holders and may adversely affect the market price of the Class A Common Stock. Issuance of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock will increase our dividend payment obligations and increase the liquidation preference. Under our currently existing ATM Agreement with Virtu Americas and B. Riley, as of March 30, 2022, we have sold an aggregate of 50,404 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, generating net proceeds to us of $1.2 million.\nOnly a limited market exists for our Class A Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Notes, which could lead to price volatility.\nOur Class A Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Notes trade on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbols \u201cCSSE,\u201d \u201cCSSEP\u201d and CSSEN,\u201d respectively. However, trading volume for our Class A Common Stock has historically been relatively limited. The limited trading market for our securities may cause fluctuations in the market value of these securities to be exaggerated, leading to price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more active trading market for our securities.\nWe currently do not plan to pay any dividends on our Class A Common Stock.\nThe payment of cash dividends on our Class A Common Stock in the future will be dependent upon our revenue and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition, our obligation to pay dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock and make quarterly interest payments on the Notes, the laws and regulations of the State of Delaware and will be within the discretion of our board of directors. As a result, any gain you may realize on our Class A Common Stock may result solely from the appreciation of such shares. If our securities become subject to the SEC\u2019s penny stock rules, broker-dealers may have trouble in completing customer transactions and trading activity in our securities may be adversely affected.\nIf at any time our securities become subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules promulgated under the Exchange Act our securities could be adversely affected. Typically, securities trading under a market price of $5.00 per share and that do not meet certain exceptions, such as national market listing or annual revenue criteria, are subject to the penny stock rules. Under these rules, broker-dealers who recommend such securities to persons other than institutional accredited investors must:\n\u25cf make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser;\n\u25cf receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction prior to sale;\n\u25cf provide the purchaser with risk disclosure documents which identify certain risks associated with investing in \u201cpenny stocks\u201d and which describe the market for these \u201cpenny stocks\u201d as well as a purchaser\u2019s legal remedies; and\n\u25cf obtain a signed and dated acknowledgement from the purchaser demonstrating that the purchaser has received the required risk disclosure documents before a transaction in a \u201cpenny stock\u201d can be completed.\nIf our securities become subject to these rules, broker-dealers may find it difficult to effectuate customer transactions and trading activity in our securities may be adversely affected. As a result, the market price of our securities may be depressed, and you may find it more difficult to sell our securities. Nasdaq could delist our Class A Common Stock from quotation on its exchange, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to sell and purchase our shares and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur Class A Common Stock is currently listed on Nasdaq, a national securities exchange. If our Class A Common Stock is not listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange at any time after the date hereof, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our Class A Common Stock;\n\u25cf reduced liquidity with respect to our Class A Common Stock;\n\u25cf a determination that our Class A Common Stock is \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our shares to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our Class A Common Stock;\n\u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock\nWe may redeem the Series A Preferred Stock.\nOn or after June 27, 2023, we may, at our option, redeem the Series A Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time. Also, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control prior to June 27, 2023, we may, at our option, redeem the Series A Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, within 120 days after the first date on which such Change of Control occurred. We may have an incentive to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock voluntarily if market conditions allow us to issue other preferred stock or debt securities at a rate that is lower than the dividend rate on the Series A Preferred Stock. If we redeem the Series A Preferred Stock, then from and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accrue on shares of Series A Preferred Stock, the shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights as a holder of those shares will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price plus accumulated and unpaid dividends, if any, payable upon redemption.\nWe must adhere to prescribed legal requirements and have sufficient cash in order to be able to pay dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock.\nIn accordance with Section 170 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, we may only declare and pay cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock if we have either net profits during the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year, or a \u201csurplus\u201d, meaning the excess, if any, of our net assets (total assets less total liabilities) over our capital. We can provide no assurance that we will satisfy such requirements in any given year. Further, even if we have the legal ability to declare a dividend, we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock. Our ability to pay dividends may be impaired if any of the risks described herein actually occur. Also, payment of our dividends depends upon our financial condition and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time\nto time. We cannot assure you that our businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock.\nA holder of Series A Preferred Stock has extremely limited voting rights.\nThe voting rights for a holder of Series A Preferred Stock are limited. Our shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock vote together as a single class and are the only class of our securities that carry full voting rights. Mr. Rouhana, our chairman of the board and chief executive officer, beneficially owns the vast majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, Mr. Rouhana exercises a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation, and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the Company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without his support, which in turn could reduce the price of our Series A Preferred Stock.\nVoting rights for holders of the Series A Preferred Stock exist primarily with respect to the ability to elect, voting together with the holders of any other series of our preferred stock having similar voting rights, two additional directors to our board of directors in the event that eighteen monthly dividends (whether or not consecutive) payable on the Series A Preferred Stock are in arrears, and with respect to voting on amendments to our certificate of incorporation, including the certificate of designations relating to the Series A Preferred Stock, that materially and adversely affect the rights of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock or authorize, increase or create additional classes or series of our capital stock that are senior to the Series A Preferred Stock.\nThe market price of the Series A Preferred Stock could be substantially affected by various factors.\nThe market price of the Series A Preferred Stock depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf prevailing interest rates, increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock;\n\u25cf trading prices of similar securities;\n\u25cf our history of timely dividend payments;\n\u25cf the annual yield from dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments;\n\u25cf general economic and financial market conditions;\n\u25cf government action or regulation;\n\u25cf the financial condition, performance and prospects of us and our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us or our competitors in our industry;\n\u25cf our issuance of additional preferred equity or debt securities; and\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results of us and our competitors.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock ranks junior to all our indebtedness and other liabilities.\nIn the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, our assets will be available to pay obligations on the Series A Preferred Stock only after all our indebtedness and other liabilities have been paid. The rights of holders of the Series A Preferred Stock to participate in the distribution of our assets will rank junior to the prior claims of our current and future creditors and any future series or class of preferred stock we may issue that ranks senior to the Series A Preferred Stock. Also, the Series A Preferred Stock effectively ranks junior to all existing and future indebtedness and to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our existing subsidiaries and any future subsidiaries. Our existing subsidiaries are, and future subsidiaries would be, separate legal entities and have no legal obligation to pay any amounts to us in respect of dividends due on the Series A Preferred Stock.\nWe have incurred and may in the future incur substantial amounts of debt and other obligations that will rank senior to the Series A Preferred Stock. As of the date of this filing, our total liabilities (excluding contingent consideration) equaled approximately $144.1 million. If we are forced to liquidate our assets to pay our creditors, we may not have sufficient assets to pay amounts due on any or all the Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding.\nMarket interest rates may materially and adversely affect the value of the Series A Preferred Stock.\nOne of the factors that will influence the price of the Series A Preferred Stock is the dividend yield on the Series A Preferred Stock (as a percentage of the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock) relative to market interest rates. Increases in market interest rates may lead prospective purchasers of the Series A Preferred Stock to expect a higher dividend yield (and higher interest rates would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for dividend payments). Thus, higher market interest rates could cause the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock to materially decrease.\nHolders of the Series A Preferred Stock may be unable to use the dividends-received deduction and may not be eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to \u201cqualified dividend income.\u201d\nDistributions paid to corporate U.S. holders of the Series A Preferred Stock may be eligible for the dividends-received deduction, and distributions paid to non-corporate U.S. holders of the Series A Preferred Stock may be subject to tax at the preferential tax rates applicable to \u201cqualified dividend income,\u201d only if we have current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Additionally, we may not have sufficient current earnings and profits during future fiscal years for the distributions on the Series A Preferred Stock to qualify as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the distributions fail to qualify as dividends, U.S. holders would be unable to use the dividends-received deduction and may not be eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to \u201cqualified dividend income.\u201d If any distributions on the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to any fiscal year are not eligible for the dividends-received deduction or preferential tax rates applicable to \u201cqualified dividend income\u201d because of insufficient current or accumulated earnings and profits, it is possible that the market value of the Series A Preferred Stock might decline.\nA reduction in the credit rating of our Series A Preferred Stock could adversely affect the pricing and liquidity of such stock.\nAny downward revision or withdrawal of the credit rating on our Series A Preferred Stock could materially adversely affect market confidence in such stock and could cause material decreases in the market price of such stock and could diminish market liquidity. Egan-Jones has initially rated our Series A Preferred Stock as BBB(-). Neither Egan-Jones nor any other agency is under any obligation to maintain any rating assigned to our Series A Preferred Stock and such rating could be revised downward or withdrawn at any time for reasons of general market changes or changes in our financial condition or for no reason at all.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock is not convertible into Class A Common Stock, including in the event of a change of control, and investors will not realize a corresponding upside if the price of the Class A Common Stock increases.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock is not convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock and earns dividends at a fixed rate. Accordingly, an increase in market price of our Class A Common Stock will not necessarily result in an increase in the market price of our Series A Preferred Stock. The market value of the Series A Preferred Stock may depend more on dividend and interest rates for other preferred stock, commercial paper and other investment alternatives and our actual and perceived ability to pay dividends on, and in the event of dissolution satisfy the liquidation preference with respect to, the Series A Preferred Stock.\nOur Notes\nThe Notes are unsecured and therefore are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness we have incurred or may incur in the future.\nThe Notes are not secured by any of our assets. As a result, the Notes are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured indebtedness, such as any new loan facility or other indebtedness to which we grant a security interest, including our $10,210,000 film acquisition advance from Great Point Media Limited which is secured by territorial licenses and distribution rights in certain films and productions owned or to be acquired by Screen Media, but only to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. In any liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy or other similar proceeding, the holders of any of our existing or future secured indebtedness may assert rights against the assets pledged to secure that indebtedness in order to receive full payment of their indebtedness before the assets may be used to pay other creditors, including the holders of the Notes.\nThe Notes are structurally subordinated to the existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries.\nThe Notes are obligations exclusively of Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment, Inc., and not any of our subsidiaries. In addition, the Notes are not guaranteed by any third-party, whether an affiliate or unrelated to us. None of the assets of our subsidiaries will be directly available to satisfy the claims of holders of the Notes. Except to the extent we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, all claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will have priority over our equity interests in such entities (and therefore the claims of our creditors, including holders of the Notes) with respect to the assets of such entities. Even if we are recognized as a creditor of one or more of these entities, our claims would still be effectively subordinated to any security interests in the assets of any such entity and to any indebtedness or other liabilities of any such entity senior to our claims. Consequently, the Notes are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of any of our subsidiaries.\nThe indenture under which the Notes are issued contains limited protection for holders of the Notes.\nThe indenture under which the Notes are issued offers limited protection to holders of the Notes. The terms of the indenture and the Notes do not restrict our ability to engage in, or otherwise be a party to, a variety of corporate transactions, circumstances or events that could have a material adverse impact on your investment in the Notes. In particular, except in limited circumstances, the terms of the indenture and the Notes do not restrict our ability to:\n\u25cf issue securities or otherwise incur additional indebtedness or other obligations, including (1) any indebtedness or other obligations that would be equal or senior in right of payment to the Notes, (2) any indebtedness or other obligations that would be secured and therefore rank effectively senior in right of payment to the Notes to the extent of the values of the assets securing such debt, (3) indebtedness that we incur that is guaranteed by one or more of our subsidiaries and which therefore is structurally senior to the Notes and (4) securities, indebtedness or obligations issued or incurred by our subsidiaries that would be senior to our equity interests in those entities and therefore rank structurally senior to the Notes with respect to the assets of these entities;\n\u25cf pay dividends on, or purchase or redeem or make any payments in respect of, capital stock or other securities ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes, including our Series A Preferred Stock or any subordinated indebtedness;\n\u25cf sell assets (other than certain limited restrictions on our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets);\n\u25cf enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf create liens or enter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u25cf make investments; or\n\u25cf create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our subsidiaries.\nIn addition, the indenture does not require us to offer to purchase the Notes in connection with a change of control or any other event (but does afford us the right to redeem the Notes prior to the prescribed redemption date upon the consummation of certain transactions).\nSimilarly, the terms of the indenture and the Notes do not protect holders of the Notes in the event that we experience changes (including significant adverse changes) in our financial condition, results of operations or credit ratings, if any.\nOur ability to recapitalize, incur additional debt and take a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the Notes may have important consequences for holders of the Notes, including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes or negatively affecting the trading value of the Notes.\nOther debt we issue or incur in the future could contain more protections for its holders than the indenture and the Notes, including additional covenants and events of default. For example, the indenture under which the Notes are issued does not contain cross-default provisions. The issuance or incurrence of any indebtedness with incremental protections could affect the market for and trading levels and prices of the Notes. Additionally, even if we issue indebtedness that ranks equally with the Notes, the holders of such indebtedness will be entitled to share ratably with the noteholders in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, or dissolution, which may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to our noteholders. Incurrence of additional debt would also further reduce the cash available to invest in operations, as a result of increased debt service obligations, and may cause a cross-default on our other obligations, as described elsewhere in these Risk Factors. If new debt is added to our current indebtedness, the related risks that we now face could be compounded.\nAn increase in market interest rates could result in a decrease in the value of the Notes.\nIn general, as market interest rates rise, notes bearing interest at a fixed rate decline in value. Consequently, if you purchase the Notes, and the market interest rates subsequently increase, the market value of your Notes may decline. We cannot predict the future level of market interest rates.\nAn active trading market for the Notes may not be sustained, which could limit your ability to sell the Notes or the market price of the Notes.\nAlthough the Notes are listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the trading symbol \u201cCSSEN,\u201d we cannot provide any assurances that an active trading market will develop or be maintained for the Notes or that you will be able to sell your Notes. The Notes may trade at a discount from their initial offering price depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our credit ratings, if any, general economic conditions, our financial condition, performance and prospects and other factors. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid trading market for the Notes will be sustained, that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the price you receive when you sell will be favorable. To the extent an active trading market is not sustained, the liquidity and trading price for the Notes may be harmed. Accordingly, you may be required to bear the financial risk of an investment in the Notes for an indefinite period of time.\nWe may choose to redeem the Notes when prevailing interest rates are relatively low.\nOn or after July 31, 2022, we may choose to redeem the Notes from time to time, especially when prevailing interest rates are lower than the rate borne by the Notes. If prevailing rates are lower at the time of redemption, you would not be able\nto reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on the Notes being redeemed. Our redemption right also may adversely impact your ability to sell the Notes as the optional redemption date or period approaches.\nIf we default on our obligations to pay our other indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on the Notes.\nAny default under the agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness that is not waived by the required lenders, and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness, could make us unable to pay principal and interest on the Notes and substantially decrease the market value of the Notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the instruments governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness, including the Notes. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, the lenders under any loan facility or other financing that we may obtain in the future could elect to terminate their commitment, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Any such default may constitute a default under the Notes, which could further limit our ability to repay our indebtedness, including the Notes. If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to seek to obtain waivers from our existing lenders at the time to avoid being in default. If we breach any loan covenants, we may not be able to obtain such a waiver from the lenders. If this occurs, we would be in default under the credit arrangement that we have, the lender could exercise its rights as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If we are unable to repay indebtedness, lenders having secured obligations could proceed against the collateral securing their debt. Because any future credit facilities will likely have, customary cross-default provisions, if the indebtedness under the Notes, or under any future credit facility is accelerated, we may be unable to repay or finance the amounts due.\nWe are not obligated to contribute to a sinking fund to retire the Notes and the Notes are not guaranteed by a third-party.\nWe are not obligated to contribute funds to a sinking fund to repay principal or interest on the Notes upon maturity or default. The Notes are not certificates of deposit or similar obligations of, or guaranteed by, any depositary institution. Further, no private party or governmental entity insures or guarantees payment on the Notes if we do not have enough funds to make principal or interest payments.\nA downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the credit rating assigned by a rating agency to us, the July 2025 Notes, or the Notes, if any, could cause the liquidity or market value of the Notes to decline significantly.\nOur credit rating is an assessment by third parties of our ability to pay our obligations. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit rating will generally affect the market value of the Notes. Our credit rating, however, may not reflect the potential impact of risks related to market conditions generally or other factors discussed above on the market value of or trading market for the Notes. Credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization in its sole discretion.\nThe Notes have received a rating of BBB from Egan-Jones Ratings Company. An explanation of the significance of ratings may be obtained from the rating agency. Generally, rating agencies base their ratings on such material and information, and such of their own investigations, studies and assumptions, as they deem appropriate. Neither we nor any underwriter undertakes any obligation to maintain our credit rating or to advise holders of the Notes of any changes in our credit rating. There can be no assurance that our credit rating will remain for any given period of time or that such credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the rating agency if in their judgment future circumstances relating to the basis of the credit rating, such as adverse changes in our company, so warrant.\nOur Class W and Class Z Warrants\nNo public market exists for our Class W Warrants or Class Z Warrants.\nWe intend to apply for quotation of the Class W Warrants on the OTCQB Market and the Class Z Warrants on the OTC Pink Market under the proposed symbols \u201cCSSEW\u201d and \u201cCSSEZ\u201d, respectively, but we cannot guarantee that our Class W Warrants or Class Z Warrants will be approved for quotation or listing on any market. Further, even if listed or quoted, an active trading market may never develop or, if developed, may not be sustained. The over-the-counter market is a significantly more limited market than Nasdaq, due to factors such as the reduced number of investors that will consider investing in securities traded over the counter, the reduced number of market makers in the securities, and the reduced number of securities analysts that follow such securities. As a result, holders of our Class W Warrants and Class Z Warrants may find it difficult to resell their warrants at prices quoted in the market or at all. You may be unable to sell Class W Warrants or Class Z Warrants unless a market for such securities can be established or sustained.\nHolders of our Class W Warrants and Class Z Warrants will have no rights as a common stockholder until such warrants are exercised.\nUntil holders of our Class W Warrants and Class Z Warrants acquire shares of our Class A Common Stock upon exercise of the Class W Warrants or Class Z Warrants, as applicable, holders of Class W Warrants and Class Z Warrants will have no rights with respect to the shares of Class A Common Stock underlying such warrants.\nThe market price of our Class A Common Stock may fall below the exercise price of the Class W Warrants and Class Z Warrants.\nThe Class W Warrants have an exercise price of $7.50 per share, subject to adjustment as described therein, and may be exercised at any time through June 30, 2023. The Class Z Warrants have an exercise price of $12.00 per share, subject to adjustment as described therein, and may be exercised at any time through June 30, 2024. The market price of our Class A Common Stock may fall below the exercise price of such warrants and remain below such exercise price through their date of expiration. Any Class W Warrants or Class Z Warrants not exercised by their date of expiration will expire worthless and we will be under no further obligation to the warrant holder.", "PERMNO": 16883, "SIC": 7812, "TIC": "CSSE"}
