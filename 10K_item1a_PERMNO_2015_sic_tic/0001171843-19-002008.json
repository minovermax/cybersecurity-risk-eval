{"cik": "1473597", "company": "STR HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves a very high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment in us. If any of these risks, or other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial, actually occur, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. In such an event, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur auditors have issued a \u201cgoing concern\u201d audit opinion.\nOur independent auditors have indicated in their report on our December 31, 2018 financial statements that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. This \u201cgoing concern\u201d opinion indicates that the financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result if planned events do not occur or do not occur timely and we do not continue as a going concern. Therefore, you should not rely on our consolidated balance sheet as an indication of the amount of proceeds that would be available to satisfy claims of creditors, and potentially be available for distribution to stockholders, in the event of liquidation. If we are unable to continue as a going concern we cannot assure that any funds will be available for distribution to stockholders.\nWe continue to incur substantial losses and cannot assure you that our actions to address our liquidity needs will be successful.\nWe continue to incur substantial losses. We incurred net losses of $5.8 million and $5.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, our principal source of liquidity was $5.6 million of cash. In addition, our credit facilities are limited to our factoring arrangement in Spain and a \u20ac2.0 million economic development loan received in March 2019 from the regional government of Asturias, Spain. Unless and until our operating results improve, we do not expect that we will be able to obtain traditional bank debt or other financing. Furthermore, tight credit in the solar manufacturing industry may delay or prevent our customers from securing funding adequate to operate their businesses and purchase our products and could lead to an increase in our bad debt levels. We have recently entered into an agreement for the sale of our Johor, Malaysia facility for RM22.5 million (approximately $5.3 million, after realtor fees, as of December 31, 2018). The sale is subject to customary closing conditions, including the timely approval of the sale by the Johor Port Authority, and we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain the requisite approvals or that the sale will take place on a timely basis, if at all. If we do not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or obtain alternative or additional sources of capital to fund operations, we will not have sufficient liquidity to satisfy operating expenses, capital expenditures and other cash needs. This raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to timely complete the sale of our Malaysia facility, or execute our strategic plans, our liquidity and capital resources will be adversely affected and we may wind down or cease any or all of our operations. Any wind down or dissolution may be a lengthy, complex and costly process and, in such event, there can be no assurance that there will be any funds available for distribution to stockholders.\nWe currently rely on a single product line for the majority of our net sales.\nIn 2018 and 2017, we derived the majority of our net sales from solar encapsulant products, for which competition remains intense. For our business to succeed, we believe we will have to successfully launch our packaging initiative. We believe that our failure to successfully launch this new product line would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot assure that we will be able to succeed in our entry into the high-end food packaging business on a timely basis, if at all.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we initiated a significant investment through our wholly owned subsidiary in Spain to enter the high-end food packaging business. This investment, which leverages our plastics expertise, includes the purchase of new, state-of-the-art plastics processing equipment and related building improvements along with the addition of experienced staff to pursue manufacturing and sales of high-end food packaging products. The food packaging business is highly competitive, having market participants with substantially more resources and experience than us. We will be a new entrant in this market with no established customer base. Our success will be based upon our ability to successfully develop new customer relationships with customers that often will have established relationships with other competing vendors. We believe that establishing these relationships will require us to develop and offer high quality products at an attractive price, and be able to timely meet customer qualification requirements, including for fitness-for-use testing and an analysis of food preservation performance in controlled environments. Moreover, we have limited experience in manufacturing and formulating products for the packaging market, and the equipment we purchased to manufacture our packaging products is highly complex. We may, therefore, experience unanticipated delays and expenses in connection with our entry into this market. We cannot assure that we will be successful in this new endeavor. Our failure to achieve success in this market on a timely basis, if at all, would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur encapsulant business is dependent upon securing net sales to new customers, growing net sales to existing key customers and increasing our market share.\nWe estimate that our global market share has declined significantly from approximately 30% in 2010 to less than 1% in 2018. The future success of our encapsulant business depends on our ability to secure net sales to new customers, to grow net sales to existing key customers and to increase our global market share. Over the last few years, we believe our European and North American customers have lost market share to Asian module manufacturers, primarily from China, who continue to dominate the global solar market. In order to be successful in the encapsulant business, we believe that we will need to significantly increase our net sales. Our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent on a limited number of customers, which may cause significant fluctuations or result in declines in our net sales.\nThe solar module industry is relatively concentrated, and we expect this concentration to increase with consolidation. As a result, we sell substantially all of our encapsulants to a limited number of solar module manufacturers. We expect that our results of operations will, for the foreseeable future, continue to depend on the sale of encapsulants to a relatively small number of customers. Our tolling partner in India, Lucent CleanEnergy accounted for approximately 32% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. Global Wedge, Inc. and Heckert Solar, each accounted for at least 10% of our net sales, and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 33% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our top five customers accounted for approximately 62% and 49% of our net sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Furthermore, participants in the solar industry, including our customers, are experiencing intense pressure to reduce their costs. Since we are part of the overall supply chain to our customers, any cost pressures experienced by them may affect our business and results of operations. Our customers may not continue to generate net sales for us. Any one of the following events may cause material fluctuations or declines in our net sales and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022 reduction in the price that one or more of our significant customers is willing to pay for our encapsulants;\n\u2022 reduction, postponement or cancellation of orders from one or more of our significant customers;\n\u2022 selection by one or more of our customers of products competitive with our encapsulants;\n\u2022 loss of one or more of our significant customers and failure to obtain additional or replacement customers;\n\u2022 failure of any of our significant customers to make timely payment for our products, if at all; and\n\u2022 our failure to meet the production demands of our customers or maintain these customer relationships.\nWe cannot assure you that our India tolling plan will be successful.\nIn connection with the orderly wind down of our manufacturing operations in China, we moved production in Asia to a tolling partner in India. We had not worked with our tolling partner in India prior to 2017 and we cannot ensure that the tolling partner will provide us with the support we anticipate or that we can otherwise successfully manage collaboration with our tolling partner. If problems develop in our relationship with our India tolling partner, or if such party fails to perform as expected, it could lead to product defects, manufacturing and shipping delays, significant cost increases, changes in our strategies, and even failure of our initiatives, each of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, the potential execution risks associated with our India tolling plan include, among other risks: (i) price competition, (ii) customer loyalty to existing suppliers, (iii) the possibility that our tolling partner may not be able to meet production requirements at the quoted price, which may result in loss of customers, reputation and/or business volumes, (iv) political and economic uncertainties, (v) limited recourse under India laws if disputes arise under our agreements with the tolling partner or other third parties, (vi) potential inability to adequately protect our intellectual property under Indian law and (vii) other additional risks generally associated with our business, each of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTechnological changes in the solar energy industry or our failure to develop and introduce or integrate new technologies could render our encapsulants uncompetitive or obsolete, which would adversely affect our business.\nThe solar energy market is very competitive, rapidly evolving and characterized by continuous improvements in solar modules to increase efficiency and power output and improve aesthetics. This requires us and our customers to invest significant financial resources to develop new products and solar module technology to enhance existing modules to keep pace with evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements and to compete effectively in the future. During the past few years, we engaged in significant cost-reduction actions, including substantial reductions to our research and development and engineering personnel. The reduction of these resources may limit our ability to introduce new products or manufacturing improvements and may put us at a competitive disadvantage, which could negatively impact our ability to increase or maintain our market share and generate net sales, and negatively impact our financial condition, prospects and results of operations. Consequently, our competitors may develop encapsulant products and technologies that perform better or are more cost-effective than our products. This could cause our encapsulants to become uncompetitive or obsolete, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Product development activities are inherently uncertain, and we could encounter difficulties and increased costs in commercializing new technologies. As a result, our product development expenditures may not produce corresponding benefits.\nMoreover, we produce a component utilized in the manufacture of solar modules. New or existing solar technologies that do not require encapsulants as we produce them, or at all, may emerge and/or gain market share. In the event that solar module manufacturers switch from EVA to POE encapsulant products and do not find our POE products competitive, such switch could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlso, manufacturing methods may emerge that could be more advanced or efficient than our current manufacturing capability. Such manufacturing methods could result in competitive products that are more effective and/or are less expensive to produce, resulting in decreased demand for our encapsulants or render them obsolete, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTechnological changes in the packaging industry or our failure to develop and introduce or integrate new technologies could render our packaging products uncompetitive or obsolete, which would adversely affect our business.\nThe packaging market is very competitive, evolving and characterized by continuous improvements and innovations. Our competitors may develop packaging products and technologies that perform better or are more cost-effective that our products. This could cause our packaging products to become uncompetitive or obsolete, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, manufacturing methods may emerge that could be more advanced or efficient than our current manufacturing capability. Such manufacturing methods could result in competitive products that are more effective and/or are less expensive to produce, resulting in decreased demand for our packaging products or render them obsolete, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face competition in our business from other companies producing encapsulants for solar modules and may face competition from upstream plastic resin manufacturers.\nThe market for encapsulants is highly competitive and continually evolving. We compete with a number of encapsulant manufacturers, many of which are large, global companies with substantially more financial, manufacturing and logistical resources and strong customer relationships. If we fail to attract and retain customers for our current and future products, we will be unable to increase our net sales and market share. Our primary encapsulant competitors include Bridgestone Corporation, Hangzhou First PV Material Co., Ltd., Mitsui Chemicals Group, Inc. and SK Chemical Ltd. We have also had to compete in the past with upstream plastic resin manufacturers moving into downstream markets. These resin manufacturers have included Dow Chemical Corporation, Dow Corning Corporation, E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Company (\u201cDuPont\u201d). We have also had to compete with other very large conglomerates such as 3M Company. We also expect to compete with new entrants to the encapsulant market, including those that may offer more advanced technological solutions or complementary products such as backsheet that possess advanced or more efficient manufacturing capabilities or that have greater financial resources than us. Some solar module manufacturers have encapsulant production capabilities of their own and this trend may broaden with market consolidation. Further, as the China solar market matures, we expect additional encapsulant providers from China and the greater Asian markets to compete with us. Our competitors may develop and produce or may be currently producing encapsulants that offer advantages over our products. A widespread adoption of any of these technologies could result in a rapid decline in our position in the encapsulant market and adversely affect our net sales and margins.\nExcess capacity exists from time to time throughout the solar supply chain, often leading to substantial solar module price declines, which in turn cause price to become the predominant factor in the encapsulant procurement process.\nSignificant excess capacity has periodically existed and may exist again in the future throughout the solar supply chain resulting in a further decrease in selling prices of solar modules. Due to many module manufacturers not producing at full capacity as well as being impacted by pricing pressure, our encapsulants\u2019 value proposition has been concomitantly reduced. Our customers and potential customers have been increasingly focused on the purchase price of encapsulants. In light of recent declines in our global market share, it is a priority that we increase our market share through net sales to existing and new customers, however, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so. In order to remain competitive, we expect to be subject to continuing downward pricing pressures that may negatively impact our net sales and net earnings. In addition, our competitors may reduce the price of their products, which may force us to further reduce the price of our encapsulant products to retain net sales.\nIf demand for solar energy in general and solar modules in particular does not continue to develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate, net sales in our business may continue to stagnate or decline, which would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur encapsulants are used in the production of solar modules; therefore our financial condition and results of operations and future growth are tied to a significant extent to the overall demand for solar energy and solar modules. The solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development and the extent to which solar modules will be widely adopted is uncertain. Many factors may affect the viability and widespread adoption of solar energy technology and demand for solar modules, and in turn, our encapsulants, including:\n\u2022 cost-effectiveness of solar modules compared to conventional and non-solar renewable energy sources and products;\n\u2022 performance and reliability of solar modules compared to conventional and non-solar renewable energy sources and products;\n\u2022 availability and amount of government subsidies and incentives to support the development and deployment of solar energy technology;\n\u2022 rate of adoption of solar energy and other renewable energy generation technologies, such as wind, geothermal and biomass;\n\u2022 seasonal fluctuations related to economic incentives and weather patterns;\n\u2022 impact of fiscal issues experienced by governments, primarily in Europe;\n\u2022 fluctuations in economic and market conditions that affect the viability of conventional and non-solar renewable energy sources, such as increases or decreases in the prices of fossil fuels and corn or other biomass materials;\n\u2022 changes in global economic conditions including increases in interest rates and the availability of financing and investment capital that is required to fund solar projects.\n\u2022 fluctuations in capital expenditures by end users of solar modules, which tend to decrease when the overall economy slows down;\n\u2022 the extent to which the electric power and broader energy industries are deregulated to permit broader adoption of solar electricity generation;\n\u2022 the cost and availability of polysilicon and other key raw materials for the production of solar modules;\n\u2022 construction of transmission facilities in certain areas to transport new solar electricity;\n\u2022 saturation in certain markets such as Europe; and\n\u2022 rate of adoption of solar energy in growing solar markets such as the United States, China, India, the Middle East and Africa.\nIf demand for solar energy and solar modules fails to develop sufficiently along our expectations, demand for our customers\u2019 products as well as demand for our encapsulants could decrease, and we may not be able to grow our business or net sales and our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nOur relationship with our tolling partner in India is subject to significant political and economic uncertainties.\nFor as long as we continue to engage a third-party manufacturer located in India to toll for us, we are exposed to certain risks. If the manufacture of our products in India is disrupted, our overall capacity could be significantly reduced and net sales and/or profitability could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, changes in Indian laws and regulations, or their interpretation, or the imposition of confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion and repatriation, imports and sources of supply, devaluations of currency or the nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may have limited legal recourse under the laws of China if disputes arise under our agreements with third parties.\nWhile we have substantially reduced our asset base and on-going costs in China through the wind down of STR China production operations, disposition of equipment under our insurance policy, sale of surplus equipment to our India tolling partner, relocation to smaller and lower-cost offices, repatriation of approximately $8.0 million in cash to our accounts in the United States, near-total reduction of our staffing in China, and collection of much of our long-outstanding accounts receivable, we still have a legal entity in China with a small administrative staff primarily focused on the collection of our remaining accounts receivable, some of which we anticipate will take some time to collect.\nThe Chinese government has enacted certain laws and regulations dealing with matters such as corporate organization and governance, foreign investment, currency control, commerce, taxation and trade. However, their experience in implementing, interpreting and enforcing these laws and regulations is limited, and our ability to enforce commercial claims or to resolve commercial disputes is unpredictable. If disputes arise under our agreements with any other parties doing business in China, including Zhenfa, we face the risk that such party may breach any such agreement or otherwise engage in conduct relating to their relationship with us that could otherwise give rise to liability under U.S. law. The resolution of these matters may be subject to the exercise of considerable discretion by agencies of the Chinese government, and forces unrelated to the legal merits of a particular matter or dispute may influence their determination. Any rights we may have to specific performance, or to seek an injunction under Chinese law, in either of these cases, may be limited, and without a means of recourse by virtue of the Chinese legal system, we may be unable to prevent these situations from occurring. The occurrence of any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur potential inability to adequately protect our intellectual property during the outsource manufacturing of our products in India could negatively impact our performance.\nIn connection with our tolling manufacturing arrangements, we rely on third-party manufacturers to implement customary manufacturer safeguards onsite, such as the use of confidentiality agreements with employees, to protect our proprietary information and technologies during the manufacturing process. However, these safeguards may not effectively prevent unauthorized use of such information and technical knowhow, or prevent the manufacturers from retaining them. We face risks that our proprietary information may not be afforded the same protection in India as it is in countries with more comprehensive intellectual property laws, and local laws may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights in India, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. In the event that the third-party tolling manufacturers of our proprietary products misappropriate our intellectual property, our business, prospects and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nA significant reduction or elimination of government subsidies and economic incentives or a change in government policies that promote the use of solar energy could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nDemand for our encapsulants depends on the continued adoption of solar energy and the resultant demand for solar modules. Demand for our products depends, in large part, on government incentives aimed to promote greater use of solar energy. In many countries in which solar modules are sold, solar energy would not be commercially viable without government incentives. This is because the cost of generating electricity from solar energy may exceed the cost of generating electricity from conventional energy sources in some regions of the world and because the capital investment associated with deploying solar modules may have a long payback period or be difficult to finance, making conventional sources available on the grid without capital investment a more widely accessible option.\nThe scope of government incentives for solar energy depends, to a large extent, on political and policy developments relating to environmental and energy concerns in a given country that are subject to change, which could lead to a significant reduction in, or a discontinuation of, the support for renewable energy in such country. Federal, state and local governmental bodies in many of our customers\u2019 target markets, including Germany, Italy, Spain, the United States, China, France, Japan and South Korea, have provided subsidies and economic incentives in the form of feed-in tariffs, rebates, tax credits and other incentives to end users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy products to promote the use of solar energy and to reduce dependency on other forms of energy. In many cases, the costs of these government subsidy programs are passed on to electricity consumers in the applicable regions. These government economic incentives could be reduced or eliminated earlier than anticipated or changed, which may result in the pull-in of demand from solar module manufacturers due to increased end-user demand being driven by the incentive to purchase a solar system prior to the enactment of the decreased feed-in tariff incentives.\nIt is our belief that most if not all government solar incentive programs are designed to increase the use of solar energy and are subject to periodic adjustment in light of the rate of installations resulting from the incentive and the economics of solar energy resulting from the price of the installed systems combined with the incentives. As has often happened over the past several years, the rate of incentivized installations has outpaced estimates and the price of solar panels and systems has fallen faster than anticipated. When combined, these dynamics result in a situation where the incentive is more generous than is necessary to drive more installations, and the incentive is subsequently reduced in light of these economics. Adjustments in these incentive programs, which may range from a minor adjustment to a complete shutdown, or in some cases even retroactive action, have resulted in the formation of boom-and-bust cycles within the solar industry.\nSome European governments have experienced sovereign debt issues in the past and a risk exists that some of these governments will continue to reduce current subsidies provided for PV installations in conjunction with generally tighter fiscal policies. The European Commission recently eliminated the Minimum Import Price for solar panel imports from China, essentially removing all protections for domestic solar panel manufacturers domiciled in Europe. STR expects the action to increase pressure on the economics of solar module production in Europe, which may further deteriorate our solar customer base in Europe.\nPolicies relative to solar in China, while generally very supportive, have shifted focus and scope with some regularity over the past few years and may change with little notice again in the future. China is currently the world\u2019s largest consumption market for solar panel installations as well as production. The strength or weakness of China\u2019s economy may cause their domestic solar policy to shift in a positive or negative manner.\nIn the United States, recent solar installation growth has been driven by Renewable Portfolio Standards, regulatory mandates to increase production of energy from renewable sources such as wind, solar, biomass and other alternatives to fossil and nuclear electricity generation, and a 30% federal energy Investment Tax Credit (the \u201cITC\u201d) for both residential and commercial solar installation through December 31, 2019. The ITC ratchets down to 26% for 2020, 22% for 2021 and 10% for 2022 and later. The ITC also includes a \u201ccommence construction\u201d clause that allows system owners to claim the associated tax credit provided construction began within the period and is finished before 2024. The United States also levied 25% import duties against Chinese solar panels under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 as part of the current trade dispute with China, and 30% duties on all crystalline silicon solar panel imports, regardless of the country of origin under Section 201, in response to a petition from Suniva and SolarWorld. These duties, along with anti-dumping and countervailing duties applying to solar imports from China and Taiwan, as well as the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21%, have resulted in a noticeable spike in investment for solar panel production in the United States. Section 201 duties decline by 5% per year to a floor of 15%, while the Section 301 duties are subject to change without substantial notice as part of trade negotiations with China.\nElectric utility companies, or generators of electricity from fossil fuels or other energy sources, could also lobby for changes to the relevant legislation in their markets to protect their revenue streams. Reduced growth in or the reduction, elimination or expiration of duties, government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy, especially those in our customers\u2019 target markets, could cause our net sales to decline and negatively impact our business.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by rising commodity costs.\nWe are dependent upon certain raw materials, particularly resin, for the manufacture of our products. Resin comprises a significant share of our cost of sales. The prices for certain resins declined slightly in 2018 versus 2017 and also in 2017 versus 2016. However, they have been volatile in the past and if raw material prices increase, our gross margins and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nDeterioration of our customers\u2019 financial profile may cause additional credit risk on our accounts receivable.\nA significant portion of our outstanding accounts receivable is derived from sales to a limited number of customers. The accounts receivable from our top five customers represented 55% and 9% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The accounts receivable due from our largest customer was 46% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2018. During the past several years, many solar module manufacturers became insolvent and the number of days outstanding on accounts receivable has increased significantly industry-wide. For example, in 2016, we recorded bad debt expense of approximately $1.2 million for China Sunergy Co Ltd. (\u201cCSUN\u201d). We subsequently won a judgment against CSUN in the China courts that was to have enabled us to receive full payment in six equal installments over a three year period, beginning in 2018. Recent China court proceedings have further delayed payments under that judgment, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining such payments. Moreover, many solar manufacturing companies continue to face significant liquidity and capital expenditure requirements, and as a result, our customers may have trouble making payments owed to us. If we are unable to collect our accounts receivable, or fail to receive payment of accounts receivable in a timely fashion, our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.\nIf we are unable to attract, train and retain key personnel, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future success depends, to a significant extent, on our ability to attract, train and retain management, operations and technical personnel. This may be particularly difficult in light of our financial performance. In addition, we have substantially reduced our headcount during the past few years, which limits the resources available to successfully manage and grow our business. The loss of the services of any member of our senior management team or the inability to hire or retain experienced management personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results.\nIn periods of cost reduction, there is a risk that employees may voluntarily leave us to pursue other career opportunities. There is substantial competition for qualified technical personnel for our business, and as a result, we may be unable to continue to attract or retain qualified technical personnel necessary for the development of our business or recruit suitable replacement personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of suppliers of raw materials for our products. Any interruption in the timely delivery of raw materials could impact our ability to deliver our products to our customers on time which could result in order cancellations and decreased net sales.\nWe purchase resins, the main component used in our manufacturing process, from a limited number of third-party suppliers. If we fail to develop or maintain our relationships with these suppliers or with our other suppliers, or if the suppliers\u2019 facilities are affected by events beyond our control, we may be unable to manufacture our products or our products may be available only for customers in lesser quantities, at a higher cost or after a delay. If we do not increase our sales volumes, which drive our demand for our suppliers\u2019 product, we may not procure at volumes sufficient to maintain favorable supplier relationships, which could lead to higher costs, lower quality and lack of availability of raw materials. We may be unable to pass along price increases relating to materials costs to our customers, in which case our gross margins could be adversely affected. In addition, we do not maintain long-term supply contracts with our suppliers. Our inventory of raw materials, including back-up supplies of resin, may not be sufficient in the event of a supply disruption. The failure of a supplier to provide materials and components, or a supplier\u2019s failure to provide materials that meet our quality, quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner, could impair our ability to manufacture our products to specifications, particularly if we are unable to obtain these materials and components from alternative sources on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms. If we are forced to change suppliers, our customers may require us to undertake testing to ensure to ensure that our products meet their specifications.\nProblems with product quality or product performance, including defects, could result in a decrease in customers and net sales, unexpected expenses and loss of market share.\nProducts as complex as ours may contain undetected defects, especially when first introduced. For example, our products may contain defects that are not detected until after they are shipped or are used because we cannot test for all possible scenarios that may arise in our customers\u2019 manufacturing processes. These defects could cause us to incur significant costs, including costs to service or replace products, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts and significantly affect our customer relationships and business reputation. If we deliver products with defects or if there is a perception that our products contain errors or defects, our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our products could materially decline. In addition, we could be subject to product liability claims and could experience increased costs and expenses related to significant product liability claims or other legal judgments against us, or a widespread product recall by us or a solar module manufacturer.\nWe may in some cases provide a short-term warranty that we have manufactured our products to our specifications. On limited occasions, we incur costs to service our products in connection with specific product performance matters that do not meet our manufacturing specifications. Also, in isolated occasions, we have offered limited short-term performance warranties relating to our encapsulants not causing module power loss. This type of arrangement may increase or decrease in 2019. If we were to ever receive a warranty claim for such matter, we would assess the need for a warranty accrual at that time.\nMinor deviations in the manufacturing process can cause substantial decreases in yield and, in some cases, cause production to be suspended. We have from time to time experienced lower-than-anticipated manufacturing yields. This typically occurs during the production of new products or during the installation and start-up of new process technologies or equipment. If we do not achieve planned yields, our cost of sales could increase, and product availability could decrease resulting in lower net sales than expected.\nRegulatory changes could impact demand for our products.\nChanges to existing regulations and capacity in the utility sector and the solar energy industry may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar modules, which in turn may significantly reduce demand for our products.\nThe market for power generation products is heavily influenced by government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry, as well as the internal policies of electric utility companies. These regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of end-user-owned power generation. In a number of countries, these regulations and policies are being modified and may continue to be modified. End users\u2019 purchases of alternative energy sources, including solar modules, could be deterred by these regulations and policies. For example, utility companies sometimes charge fees to larger, industrial customers for disconnecting from the electricity transmission grid or relying on the electricity transmission grid for back-up purposes. Such fees could increase the costs of using solar modules, which may lead to reduced demand for solar modules and, in turn, our encapsulants.\nWe anticipate that solar modules and their installation will continue to be subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes, safety, environmental protection, utility interconnection, metering and related matters in various countries. New or revised government regulations or utility policies pertaining to solar modules may result in significant additional expenses to our customers, and their distributors and end users, which could cause a significant reduction in demand for solar modules and, in turn, our encapsulants.\nThe adoption of solar energy in most parts of the world will be dependent on the capacity of applicable electricity transmission grids to instantaneously accept and distribute the increased volume of electricity to end-users. For example, some countries may implement curtailment policies that limit solar electricity purchases based on transmission congestion or lack of incremental demand in excess of baseload supply, which may be cheaper for utilities to produce and much more difficult to modulate. The lack of available capacity on the transmission grid could substantially impact the adoption of solar energy, which could cause a significant reduction in demand for solar modules and, in turn, our encapsulants.\nSimilarly, changes to existing or new regulations to food packaging and the use of plastics in particular may require changes in our approach to the high-end food packaging market, including, changes to the design of our products, the use of certain materials within those products and customer demand.\nRegulations currently exist, particularly in the European Union, to reduce the amount of plastics in the waste stream. The Company\u2019s multi-layer film products, though not specifically falling under the scope of these regulations, could be targeted in the future, which could result in reduced demand for our products as they currently exist.\nWe typically rely upon trade secrets and contractual restrictions, rather than patents, to protect our proprietary rights. Failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position and protecting our rights or defending against third-party allegations of infringement may be costly.\nProtection of proprietary processes, methods, documentation and other technology is critical to our business. Failure to protect, monitor and control the use of our intellectual property rights could cause us to lose our ability to compete and to incur significant expenses. We typically rely on trade secrets, trademarks and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the measures we take to protect our trade secrets and other intellectual property rights may be insufficient. While we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property rights, such confidentiality provisions related to our trade secrets could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets. Also, others may independently develop technologies or products that are similar or identical to ours. In such case, our trade secrets would not prevent third parties from competing with us.\nThird parties or employees may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights, which could harm our business and operating results. Policing unauthorized use of intellectual property rights can be difficult and expensive, and adequate remedies may not be available.\nThe sales cycle for our products can be lengthy and may result in uncertainty and delays in generating net sales.\nThe integration and testing of our encapsulants with prospective customers\u2019 solar modules or enhancements to existing customers\u2019 solar modules requires a substantial amount of time and resources. A customer may need up to one year and in some cases even longer, to test, evaluate and adopt our encapsulants and qualify a new solar module before ordering our encapsulants. Our customers then need additional time to begin volume production of solar modules that incorporate our encapsulants. As a result, the complete sales cycle for our encapsulants can be lengthy. We may experience a significant delay between the time we increase our expenditures for product development, sales and marketing efforts and raw materials inventory and the time we generate net sales, if any, from these expenditures.\nIn the case of our high-end food packaging customers, some require either certification or progress toward certification and adherence to standards of the British Retail Consortium (\u201cBRC\u201d) Global Standard for Food Safety. Certain of these standards require a period of commercial operation during which our procedures are monitored for compliance. Our packaging customers also have qualification requirements, typically accomplished at their premises, including fitness-for-use testing and an analysis of food preservation performance in controlled environments. We expect the sales cycle for our high-end food packaging products to include a typical customer qualification period of between two weeks to eight weeks.\nAs a supplier to solar module manufacturers, disruptions in any other component of the supply chain to solar module manufacturers may adversely affect our customers and consequently limit the growth of our business and net sales.\nWe supply a component to solar module manufacturers. If there are disruptions in any other area of the supply chain for solar module manufacturers, it could affect the overall demand for our encapsulants, which in turn would adversely affect our net sales.\nWe generally operate on a purchase order basis with our customers, and their ability to cancel, reduce, or postpone orders could reduce our net sales and increase our costs.\nNet sales to our customers are typically made through non-exclusive, short-term purchase order arrangements that specify prices and delivery parameters. The timing of placing these orders and the amounts of these orders are at our customers\u2019 discretion. Customers may cancel, reduce or postpone purchase orders with us prior to production on relatively short notice. If customers cancel, reduce or postpone existing orders or fail to make anticipated orders, it could result in the delay or loss of anticipated net sales, which could lead to excess raw materials inventory and unabsorbed overhead costs. Because our encapsulants have a limited shelf life from the time they are produced until they are incorporated into a solar module, we may be required to sell any excess inventory at a reduced price, or we may not be able to sell it at all and incur an inventory write-off, which could reduce our net sales and increase our costs.\nOur substantial international operations and activities in emerging markets subject us to a number of risks.\nOf our total net sales, approximately 79% and 98% were generated from outside the United States in each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow, including:\n\u2022 a module manufacturer\u2019s unwillingness to purchase from foreign-owned companies;\n\u2022 difficulty in enforcing agreements in foreign legal systems and in the collection of trade accounts receivable;\n\u2022 foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income, impose tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade and investment, including currency exchange controls;\n\u2022 protectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies;\n\u2022 difficulties in securing, servicing and increasing net sales to foreign customers;\n\u2022 potentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022 fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect our profitability in U.S. dollars;\n\u2022 potential noncompliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations;\n\u2022 operations in parts of the world where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local practices and customs;\n\u2022 inability to obtain, maintain or enforce intellectual property rights and otherwise protect against clone or \u201cknock off\u201d products;\n\u2022 labor strikes, especially those affecting transportation and shipping;\n\u2022 risk of nationalization of private enterprises;\n\u2022 changes in general economic and political conditions in the countries in which we operate, including changes in the government incentives on which our module manufacturing customers and their customers rely;\n\u2022 multiple, conflicting and unexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements, including those with respect to local content rules, environmental protection, export duties, import duties and quotas;\n\u2022 disruptions in our business operations or damage to strategic assets that may not be recoverable from applicable insurance policies caused by potential unfavorable weather patterns in certain locations of the world including, but not limited to, nor\u2019easters, blizzards, earthquakes, typhoons and hurricanes;\n\u2022 terrorist attacks and acts of violence or war;\n\u2022 difficulty with developing staffing and simultaneously managing widespread operations as a result of, among other things, distance, language and cultural differences; and\n\u2022 difficulty of and costs relating to compliance with the different commercial and legal requirements of the international markets in which we operate.\nOur dramatically scaled-back China entity is subject to national, regional and local regulation. The regulatory environment in China is evolving, and officials in the Chinese government exercise broad discretion in deciding how to interpret and apply regulations. It is possible that the Chinese government\u2019s current or future interpretation and application of existing or new regulations will negatively impact our China entity, result in regulatory investigations or lead to fines or penalties.\nAdditionally, our operations in India will require us to comply with local laws and regulatory requirements, which are complex and of which we may not always be aware, and may expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our Indian operations may also subject us to trade restrictions, reduced or inadequate protection for intellectual property rights, security breaches and other factors that may adversely affect our business. Negative developments in any of these areas could increase our costs of operations or otherwise harm our business.\nWe may be subject to claims that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated the patent or other intellectual property rights of a third party. The outcome of any such claims is uncertain and any unfavorable result could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. These claims may be costly to defend, and we may ultimately be unsuccessful. An adverse determination in any such litigation could subject us to significant liability to third parties (potentially including treble damages), require us to seek licenses from third parties (which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all), make substantial one-time or ongoing royalty payments, redesign our products or subject us to temporary or permanent injunctions prohibiting the manufacture and sale of our products, the use of our technologies or the conduct of our business. Protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our products until resolution of such litigation. In addition, we may have no insurance coverage in connection with such litigation and may have to bear all costs arising from any such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected by seasonal trends, incentive policy changes and construction cycles.\nWe may be subject to industry-specific seasonal fluctuations in the future, particularly in climates that experience colder weather during the winter months. There are various reasons for periodic fluctuations, mostly related to economic incentives and weather patterns. A change in government incentives may result in the pull-in of demand from solar module manufacturers due to increased end-user demand driven by the incentive to purchase a solar system prior to the enactment of the decreased feed-in tariff. As a result, we may see atypical net sales during one reporting period as compared to another. In addition, our Spanish operation tends to have lower net sales during the third quarter of the year due to the European summer vacation, which occurs in August. Our net sales are also typically lower in December, as module manufacturers often defer purchases of our encapsulants to the next calendar year due to reduced consumption during the holiday period and the desire to reduce year-end inventory. Solar module customers will sometimes make purchasing decisions toward the end of the year in order to take advantage of tax credits or for budgetary reasons. In addition, construction activity is typically slower in colder months, especially in light of dangerous or difficult conditions brought about by ice and snow and frozen ground.\nFluctuations in exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, even if our underlying business results improve or remain steady.\nOur reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, and we are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk because a significant portion of our net sales and costs are currently denominated in foreign currencies, primarily euros and to a lesser extent Indian rupee and Chinese renminbi, which we convert to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. We currently do not engage in any hedging activities with respect to currency fluctuations. Changes in exchange rates on the translation of the earnings in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars are directly reflected in our financial results. To the extent the value of the U.S. dollar increases against these foreign currencies and our prices do not offset such increase, it will negatively impact our net sales, even if our results of operations have improved or remained steady. While the currency of our net sales and costs is generally matched, to the extent our costs and net sales are not denominated in the same currency for a particular location, we could experience further exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. We cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations and may incur net foreign currency losses in the future.\nWe are a holding company with no business operations of our own and depend on our subsidiaries for cash.\nWe are a holding company with no significant business operations of our own. Our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. Dividends from, and cash generated by, our subsidiaries are our principal sources of cash to repay any future indebtedness, fund operations and pay any stockholder dividends. Accordingly, our ability to repay any indebtedness, fund operations and pay any dividends to our stockholders is dependent on the earnings and the distributions of funds from our subsidiaries.\nCompliance with environmental and health and safety regulations can be expensive, and noncompliance with these regulations may result in adverse publicity, potentially significant liabilities, monetary damages and fines.\nWe are required to comply with federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding protection of the environment and health and safety. If more stringent laws and regulations are adopted in the future, the costs of compliance with these new laws and regulations could be substantial. If we do not comply with such present or future laws and regulations or related permits, we may be required to pay substantial fines, suspend production or cease operations. We use, generate and discharge hazardous substances, chemicals and wastes in our product development and manufacturing activities. In addition, some of our facilities are located on properties with a history of use involving hazardous substances, chemicals and wastes and may be contaminated. We have performed environmental investigations and remediation activities at our 10 Water Street, Enfield, Connecticut location. During our investigations, the Enfield site was found to contain the presence of various contaminants. Any failure by us to control the use of, to remediate the presence of, or to restrict adequately the discharge of, such substances, chemicals or wastes could subject us to potentially significant liabilities, clean-up costs, monetary damages, fines or suspensions in our business operations. See Item 1,-Business,-Environmental Regulation. We cannot assure that we will not discover further environmental contamination or that we would not be required to incur significant expenditures for environmental remediation in the future.\nWe may undertake acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or other strategic alliances, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business, and such undertakings may be unsuccessful.\nAcquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances may expose us to new operational, regulatory, market and geographic risks as well as risks associated with additional capital requirements.\nThese risks include, among other things:\n\u2022 our inability to integrate new operations, personnel, products, services and technologies;\n\u2022 unforeseen or hidden liabilities, including exposure to lawsuits associated with newly acquired companies;\n\u2022 the diversion of resources from our existing business;\n\u2022 disagreement with joint venture or strategic alliance partners;\n\u2022 contravention of regulations governing cross-border investment;\n\u2022 failure to comply with laws and regulations, as well as industry or technical standards of the overseas markets into which we expand;\n\u2022 our inability to generate sufficient net sales to offset the costs and expenses of acquisitions, strategic investments, joint ventures or other strategic alliances;\n\u2022 potential loss of, or harm to, employee or customer relationships;\n\u2022 diversion of our management\u2019s time; and\n\u2022 disagreements as to whether opportunities belong to us or the joint venture.\nAny of these events could disrupt our ability to manage our business, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Such risks could also result in our failure to derive the intended benefits of the acquisitions, strategic investments, joint ventures or strategic alliances, and we may be unable to recover our investment in such initiatives.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of a new U.S. tax legislation, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge for intercompany transactions. We are subject to potential tax examinations in these various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other tax positions and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these potential examinations, and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of examinations could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision, net earnings, and cash flows. In addition, our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process.\nWe have received financial incentives from government bodies in certain foreign jurisdictions that are based on the maintenance of various requirements. If such requirements are not maintained, we may lose the financial incentives, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have received financial incentives from government entities in certain foreign jurisdictions based on the maintenance of various requirements. For example, our Spanish subsidiary received grants for solar encapsulant production equipment that required us to maintain a specific level of employment and use of assets. All applicable requirements have expired as of June 30, 2016. Should the Company exit its investment in Spain, conditions of certain financial incentives could be audited and if found to be non-compliant, the Company could be required to refund a portion of previously granted incentives, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe loan that we have obtained from the Spanish regional government in support of our high-end packaging business includes restrictions on our ability to move cash to our accounts in the United States or elsewhere without prior approval of the SRP.\nZhenfa\u2019s ownership of a significant portion of our outstanding common stock may expose us to greater regulatory scrutiny.\nAt various times during recent years, the governments of the United States and China have had disagreements over political and economic issues. Controversies may arise in the future between these two countries. Any political or trade controversies between the United States and China could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business in China, the market price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets in the United States. Also, as a result of recent controversies involving Chinese controlled companies, it is possible that such companies have come under increased scrutiny in the United States and other countries. If we become subject to enhanced regulatory review and oversight, responding to such review and oversight may be expensive and time consuming and may have a material adverse effect on our operations, even if we otherwise have complied with all legal and regulatory requirements.\nCertain of our directors and officers may be located outside of the United States.\nCertain of our directors and officers are not United States citizens or may reside outside of the United States. It may not be possible for our stockholders to effect service of process upon such directors and officers within the United States, to bring action against such directors or officers or to enforce against such directors or officers court judgments based on the civil liabilities provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. Further, it is unclear if extradition treaties now in effect between the United States and China (and, for that matter, any other country that one of our directors or officers may be a citizen of or reside in) would permit effective enforcement of criminal penalties against our directors outside of the United States under the United States Federal securities laws or otherwise.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our indebtedness and other obligations and liquidity needs.\nOn March 13, 2019, our wholly owned Spanish subsidiary, Specialized Technology Resources Espa\u00f1a S.A.U. (\u201cSTR Spain\u201d) obtained a \u20ac2.0 million (approximately $2.3 million as of December 31, 2018) loan (the \u201cSTR Spain Loan\u201d) from the Regional Promotion Society (\u201cSRP\u201d), an agency of the government of Asturias, Spain. STR Spain is required to use the loan proceeds to help finance the launch and operation of its food packaging business. In connection with this loan, we have also agreed to provide STR Spain with resources to support the STR Spain Loan and the continuity of the packaging initiative. STR Spain also has a factoring agreement to sell, with recourse, certain European, U.S. and other foreign company-based receivables. As of December 31, 2018, \u20ac0.3 million (approximately $0.4 million as of December 31, 2018) was outstanding under the factoring agreement. Our business may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and unless our results improve, we do not expect that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness and to fund our other obligations and liquidity needs.\nOur outstanding indebtedness contain covenants that limit our operating flexibility, and could adversely affect our operations and financial results and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\nThe STR Spain Loan contains covenants that limit the operating flexibility of STR Spain, and prohibit STR Spain from making distributions to us, as sole shareholder, without the prior approval of the lender. These covenants may, among other things,\n\u2022 make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;\n\u2022 increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets in which we participate;\n\u2022 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022 limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts, strategic transactions or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors;\n\u2022 make certain investments; or\n\u2022 sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of our packaging assets.\nIf there were an event of default under the STR Spain Loan, the lender could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately. Our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under the STR Spain Loan if accelerated upon an event of default, and there is no assurance that we would be able to repay, refinance or restructure the payments on such debt.\nOur indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates, which may expose us to higher interest payments.\nAs of the date of this report, all of our indebtedness is subject to floating interest rates, which makes us more vulnerable to changes in prevailing interest rates. A significant increase in prevailing rates of interest could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\nWe currently have fewer than 300 stockholders of record and, therefore, are eligible to terminate the registration of our common stock under the Exchange Act.\nAs a public company with fewer than 300 stockholders of record, we currently register our shares of common stock under the Exchange Act, on a voluntary basis. Section 12(g)(4) of the Exchange Act allows for the registration of any class of securities to be terminated 90 days after a company files a certification with the SEC that the number of holders of record of such class of security is fewer than 300 persons. Upon the effectiveness of the termination of registration under Section 12, we would not be required to comply with certain disclosure requirements under the Exchange Act, including, but not limited to, proxy statement filings and filings by insiders to disclose the acquisition and disposition of our securities. In addition, upon the filing of the certification with the SEC, our obligation to file annual, quarterly and current reports under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act would be immediately suspended. If we cease filing periodic and current reports for any reason, investors would have limited access to information about our business, which may reduce the value of our common stock and also affect your ability to sell our common stock.\nOur common stock is traded on the OTCQB Market which could limit the liquidity of our common stock, and hinder our ability to raise additional capital as well as having other negative results.\nWe are quoted on the OTCQB marketplace under the symbol \u201cSTRI.\u201d Stocks traded on the OTCQB marketplace generally have a more limited trading volume and exhibit a wider spread between the bid/ask quotations than stock traded on national exchanges. Many institutional investors have investment policies that prohibit them from trading in stocks on the OTCQB marketplace. The OTCQB marketplace affords our stockholders fewer corporate governance protections than if we were listed on a national exchange, such as requirements concerning the independence of our board of directors. As a result, we and our investors could face adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022 limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u2022 reduced liquidity for our securities;\n\u2022 increased volatility in the market price and trading volume for our securities;\n\u2022 a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u2022 a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nOur common stock is classified as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d and trading of our shares may be restricted by the SEC\u2019s penny stock regulations.\nRules 15g-1 through 15g-9 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on certain brokers-dealers who engage in transactions involving a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. Our common stock is covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and \u201caccredited investors.\u201d The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that, prior to a transaction in a penny stock that is not otherwise exempt, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules may discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common shares.\nWe expect that our stock price may continue to fluctuate significantly, which could cause the value of your investment to decline, and you may not be able to sell your shares at or above your purchase price.\nOver the past few years the market prices of many companies in the solar industry have been extremely volatile. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance. The trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, including:\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial and operating results, including our cash balance;\n\u2022 market conditions in the broader stock market;\n\u2022 potential short selling interest in our common stock;\n\u2022 the amount of public float that trades regularly;\n\u2022 introduction of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 issuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022 investor perceptions of us and the solar energy industry;\n\u2022 sales, or anticipated sales, of large blocks of our stock;\n\u2022 potential action of corporate raiders or other potential acquirers of us if our stock price is undervalued;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022 regulatory or political developments;\n\u2022 litigation and governmental investigations; and\n\u2022 changing economic conditions.\nThese and other factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock or have become activist stockholders. If any of our stockholders brings a lawsuit against us, or becomes active with demands, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit and responding to various requests. These events clearly could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation.\nAs a public company, we are subject to financial and other reporting and corporate governance requirements that may be difficult for us to satisfy.\nWe are required to file with the SEC annual and quarterly information and other reports that are specified in Section 13 of the Exchange Act. We are required to ensure that we have the ability to prepare financial statements that are fully compliant with all SEC reporting requirements on a timely basis. We are also subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements and certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, which impose significant compliance obligations upon us. If we fail to maintain the requirements with respect to our internal accounting and audit functions, our ability to report our operating results on a timely and accurate basis could be negatively affected.\nWe have implemented the standards required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSection 404\u201d), and failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe have documented and tested our internal control procedures to satisfy the requirements of Section 404, which requires an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and may suffer adverse regulatory consequences or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements.\nIf a substantial number of shares are sold in a short period of time, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nIf our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly. The perception in the public market that such stockholders might sell shares of common stock could also depress the market price of our common stock. As of February 28, 2019, we had 20,152,029 shares of our common stock outstanding, some of which are owned by our directors, executive officers and affiliates. Subject to vesting requirements, these shares are eligible for sale in the public market. A decline in the price of shares of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more analysts downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nSome provisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may deter third parties from acquiring us and diminish the value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for, among other things:\n\u2022 restrictions on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting and the business that can be conducted at such meeting;\n\u2022 restrictions on the ability of our stockholders to remove a director or fill a vacancy on the Board of Directors;\n\u2022 our ability to issue preferred stock with terms that the Board of Directors may determine, without stockholder approval;\n\u2022 the absence of cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022 a prohibition of action by written consent of stockholders unless such action is recommended by all directors then in office; and\n\u2022 advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations.\nThese provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change of control of us that is in the best interest of our minority stockholders. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging future takeover attempts.\nZhenfa beneficially owns a significant interest in our common stock. As a result, it is able to exert significant influence over us, and Zhenfa's interests may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nBased solely upon filings made by Zhenfa with the SEC, Zhenfa controls approximately 46% of the voting power of our common stock as of December 31, 2018 and is able to exert substantial influence over us, including the election of our directors and most matters requiring board or stockholder approval, including business strategies, mergers, business combinations, acquisitions or dispositions of significant assets, issuances of common stock, incurrence of debt or other financing and the payment of dividends. A controlling or significant stockholder may have the effect of making it difficult for a third party to seek, or may discourage or delay a third party from seeking, to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock, which could adversely affect the market price of our stock. Zhenfa maintains separate business operations from us. As a result, Zhenfa's interests may not always be consistent with the interests of our other stockholders. To the extent that conflicts of interest may arise among us, Zhenfa and its affiliates, those conflicts may be resolved in a manner adverse to our other stockholders.", "PERMNO": 93111, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "STRI"}
