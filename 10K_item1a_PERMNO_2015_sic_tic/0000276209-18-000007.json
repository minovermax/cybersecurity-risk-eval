{"cik": "276209", "company": "CONNECTICUT WATER SERVICE INC / CT", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or anticipated future results. For a discussion identifying additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, see the discussion in \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information\u201d, in Item 7 below - \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nWe may fail to consummate the Merger, and uncertainties related to the consummation of the Merger may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and negatively impact the price of our common stock.\nAs previously discussed, on March 14, 2018, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with SJW and Merger Sub, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of SJW. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of SJW. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of our common stock (other than certain cancelled shares) will be converted into the right to receive 1.1375 shares of SJW common stock. The Merger is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions beyond our control, including approval of the Merger Agreement by the Company\u2019s shareholders, approval of the issuance of SJW common stock in the Merger by SJW\u2019s stockholders, regulatory approvals (including the approval of PURA and MPUC) and other customary closing conditions. There is no assurance that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will occur on the terms and timeline currently contemplated or at all. The conditions to the Merger could prevent or delay the completion of the Merger. In addition, the efforts to satisfy the closing conditions of the Merger, including the regulatory approval process, may place a significant burden on management and internal resources, and the Merger and related transactions, whether or not consummated, may result in a diversion of management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations and a disruption of our operations. Any significant diversion of management\u2019s attention away from ongoing business and any difficulties encountered in the Merger process could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Merger Agreement also contains certain customary termination rights, including the right for each of the Company and SJW to terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger is not consummated by March 14, 2019 (or, in the event all closing conditions have been met other than certain regulatory approvals, June 14, 2019) or in the event of an uncured material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement such that the conditions to closing would not be satisfied. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we may be required to pay a termination fee to SJW of $28.1 million or reimburse SJW\u2019s expenses up to $5 million. If the proposed Merger is not completed or the Merger Agreement is terminated, the price of our common stock may decline, including to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects an assumption that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be consummated without unexpected delays, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to various uncertainties and restrictions on the conduct of our business while the Merger is pending, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees, customers, vendors, communities and other third parties who deal with us may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel pending the consummation of the Merger, as such personnel may experience uncertainty about their future roles following the consummation of the Merger. Additionally, these uncertainties could cause customers, vendors and other third parties who deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships with us or fail to extend an existing relationship with us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts us from taking certain actions without SJW\u2019s consent while the Merger is pending. These restrictions may, among other matters, prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities, buying or selling assets, making certain capital expenditures, refinancing or incurring additional indebtedness, entering into transactions or making other changes to our business prior to consummation of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement. These restrictions and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to lawsuits relating to the Merger, which may impact the timing of the closing of the Merger and adversely impact our business.\nThe Company and our directors and officers may be subject to lawsuits relating to the Merger. Litigation is very common in connection with the sale of public companies, regardless of whether the claims have any merit. One of the conditions to consummating the Merger is that no order preventing or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger shall have been issued by any court. Consequently, if any lawsuit challenging the Merger is successful in obtaining an order preventing the consummation of the Merger, that order may delay or prevent the Merger from being completed. While we will evaluate and defend against any lawsuits, the time and costs of defending against litigation relating to the Merger may adversely affect our business.\nBecause we incur significant capital expenditures annually, we depend on the rates we charge our customers, which are subject to regulation.\nThe water utility business is capital intensive. On an annual basis, we spend significant amounts of capital for additions to or replacement of property, plant and equipment. Our ability to maintain and meet our financial objectives is dependent upon the rates we charge our customers. These rates are subject to approval by PURA in Connecticut and the MPUC in Maine. Our Regulated Companies are entitled to file rate increase requests, from time to time, to recover our investments in utility plant and expenses. Once a rate increase petition is filed with the respective agency, the ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly. We can provide no assurances that any future rate increase requests will be approved by each agency; and, if approved, we cannot guarantee that any such rate increase requests will be granted in a timely or sufficient manner to cover the investments and expenses for which we initially sought the rate increase. Additionally, a regulatory agency may rule that a company must reduce its rates.\nUnder a 2007 Connecticut law, PURA authorizes regulated water companies to use a rate adjustment mechanism, known as WICA, for eligible projects completed and in service for the benefit of the customers. During 2013, the Maine Legislature enacted a law that allows Maine Water for expedited recovery of investments in water systems infrastructure replacement, both treatment and distribution, through WISC, similar to WICA in Connecticut. Maine Water began to use the WISC during 2014.\nIf we are unable to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due, or we default under certain other provisions of our loan documents, our indebtedness could be accelerated and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $253.4 million in long-term debt outstanding. Our ability to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due will depend upon our current and future performance. Our performance is affected by many factors, some of which are beyond our control. We believe that our cash generated from operations, and, if necessary, borrowing under our existing and planned credit facilities, will be sufficient to enable us to make our debt payments as they become due. If, however, we do not generate sufficient cash, we may be required to refinance our obligations or sell additional equity, which may be on terms that are not as favorable to the Company as current terms.\nNo assurance can be given that any debt refinancing or sale of equity will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms. In addition, our failure to comply with certain provisions contained in our trust indentures and loan agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness could lead to a default on these documents, which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness.\nCredit market volatility may affect our ability to refinance our existing debt, borrow funds under our existing lines of credit or incur additional debt.\nDuring certain periods of the Unites States credit and liquidity crisis of 2008-2009, the volatility and disruption in the credit and banking markets reached unprecedented levels. In many cases, the markets contained limited credit capacity for certain issuers, and lenders had requested shorter terms. The market for new debt financing was limited and in some cases not available at all. In addition, the markets had increased the uncertainty that lenders will be able to comply with their previous commitments. The Company noted improvements during the second half of 2009 and continuing through 2017. If significant market disruption and volatility return, the Company may not be able to refinance our existing debt when it comes due, draw upon our existing lines of credit or incur additional debt, which may require us to seek other funding sources to meet our liquidity needs or to fund our capital expenditures budget. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or other financing on reasonable terms, or at all.\nFailure to maintain our existing credit ratings could affect our cost of funds and related margins and liquidity position.\nSince 2003, Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services (\u201cS&P\u201d) has rated our outstanding debt and has given credit ratings to us and our subsidiary The Connecticut Water Company. Their evaluations are based on a number of factors, which include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. In January 2018, S&P affirmed its \u2018A\u2019 corporate credit rating on the Company. Additionally, S&P revised the Company\u2019s ratings outlook as negative due to their view that the recently revised corporate tax code could potentially strain cash flows if our regulators determine a reduction in revenue requirements is appropriate and a potential weakening of consolidated financial measures due to our growth strategy and high capital spending requirements.\nWe may sustain losses that exceed or are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured.\nWe maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall legal and risk management strategy to minimize our potential liabilities. Our insurance programs have varying coverage limits, exclusions and maximums, and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make. Generally, our insurance policies cover property damage, worker\u2019s compensation, employer\u2019s liability, general liability and automobile liability. Each policy includes deductibles or self-insured retentions and policy limits for covered claims. As a result, we may sustain losses that exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured.\nAlthough in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs, there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future, or that such insurance can be economically secured. For example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, more limited coverage, increased premium costs or deductibles.\nWe are subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks, which make us vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or other sanctions.\nWater utilities, including our Regulated Companies, have a large consumer customer base and as a result are exposed to public criticism regarding, among other things, the reliability of their water services, the quality of water provided, and the timeliness and accuracy of bills that are provided for such services. Adverse publicity and negative consumer sentiment may render legislatures and other governing bodies, the MPUC, PURA and other regulatory authorities, and government officials less likely to view companies such the Company and its Regulated Companies in a favorable light, and may cause the Company and its Regulated Companies to be susceptible to less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes, as well as increased regulatory oversight and more stringent regulatory requirements. Unfavorable regulatory outcomes may include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations, as well as fines, penalties or other sanctions or requirements. The imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material negative impact on the Company and each of our regulated compaies\u2019 business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur inability to comply with debt covenants under our credit facilities could result in prepayment obligations.\nWe are obligated to comply with debt covenants under our loan and debt agreements. Failure to comply with covenants under our credit facilities could result in an event of default, which if not timely cured or waived, could result in us being required to repay or finance these borrowings before their due date, could limit future borrowings, and result in cross default issues and increase our borrowing costs. The covenants are normal and customary in bank and loan agreements. The Company and its subsidiaries were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2017.\nMarket conditions, interest rate changes or changes in demographics may unfavorably impact the value of our benefit plan assets and liabilities which then could require significant additional funding.\nThe performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the Company\u2019s pension and post-retirement benefit plans and could significantly impact our results of operations and financial position. As detailed in the \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d, the Company has significant obligations in these areas and the Company holds significant assets in these trusts. The market value of these assets are subject to market fluctuations, which may affect investment returns, which may fall below the Company\u2019s projected return rates. A decline in the market value of the pension and post-retirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under the Company\u2019s pension and post-retirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in value. Additionally, the Company\u2019s pension and post-retirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. Also, future increases in pension and other post-retirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable from our customers, and the results of operations and financial position of the Company could be negatively affected.\nOur operating costs could be significantly increased because of state and federal environmental and health and safety laws and regulations.\nOur water operations are governed by extensive federal and state environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations, including the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Water Act and similar state laws, and federal and state regulations issued under these laws by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state environmental regulatory agencies. These laws and regulations establish, among other things, criteria and standards for drinking water and for discharges into the waters of the United States, the State of Connecticut or the State of Maine. Pursuant to these laws, we are required to obtain various environmental permits from environmental regulatory agencies for our operations. We cannot assure that we have been or will be at all times in full compliance with these laws, regulations and permits. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations are complex and change frequently. These laws, and the enforcement thereof, have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the State of Connecticut recently revised its Water Diversion Regulations. The revision modified the prior exemptions from Water Diversion permitting and permits are now required for certain expansions of service beyond Exclusive Service Areas identified as of October 2016. While we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with these laws and our permits, it is possible that new or stricter standards could be imposed that will raise our operating costs. Although these costs may be recovered in the form of higher rates, there can be no assurance that either the PURA or the MPUC would approve rate increases to enable us to fully recover such costs. In summary, we cannot be assured that our costs of complying with, or discharging liabilities under, current and future environmental and health and safety laws will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business has inherently dangerous workplaces. If we fail to maintain safe work sites, we can be exposed to not only people impacts but also to financial losses such as penalties and other liabilities.\nOur safety record is critical to our reputation. We maintain health and safety standards to protect our employees, customers, vendors and the public. Although we intend to adhere to such health and safety standards and aim for zero injuries, it is extremely difficult to avoid accidents at all times.\nOur business sites, including construction and maintenance sites, often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of equipment, moving vehicles, pressurized water, underground trenches and vaults, chemicals and other regulated materials. On many sites we are responsible for safety and, accordingly, must implement safety procedures. If we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective or are not followed by our employees or others, our employees and others may be injured or die. Unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover and raise our operating costs. Any of the foregoing could result in financial losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, our operations can involve the handling and storage of hazardous chemicals, which, if improperly handled, stored or disposed of, could subject us to penalties or other liabilities. We are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety. Although we maintain functional employee groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health, safety, and environmental work procedures throughout our organization, including construction sites and maintenance sites, the failure to comply with such regulations or procedures could subject us to liability.\nNew and more stringent climate change laws and regulations may be adopted that could require compliance with greenhouse gas emissions standards and other climate change initiatives. Additional capital expenditures could be required and our operating costs could be increased in order to comply with new regulatory standards imposed by federal and state environmental agencies.\nClimate change has been receiving ever increasing attention worldwide in the past decade. Many scientists, legislators, and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Possible new climate change laws and regulations, if enacted, may require us to monitor and/or change our utility operations. It is possible that new standards could be imposed that will require additional capital expenditures or raise our operating costs. Because it is uncertain what laws will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Although these expenditures and costs may be recovered in the form of higher rates, there can be no assurance that either PURA or the MPUC or other regulatory bodies that govern our business would permit us to recover such expenditures and costs. We cannot assure you that our costs of complying with new standards or laws will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nStreamflow Regulations in Connecticut could potentially impact our ability to serve our customers.\nIn December 2011, regulations concerning the flow of water in Connecticut\u2019s rivers and streams were adopted. As promulgated, the regulations require that certain downstream releases be made from seven of Connecticut Waters\u2019s eighteen active reservoirs no later than ten years following the adoption of stream classifications by the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (\u201cDEEP\u201d). Currently, downstream releases are made at two locations. No groundwater supply wells are affected by the regulations.\nDEEP has finalized stream classifications in two areas of the state where Connecticut Water maintains and operates sources of supply. Other areas of the state, including areas where Connecticut Water operates, remain to be classified. The Company remains engaged in the process in order to minimize impact to our available water supply. Although significantly and favorably modified from prior versions, the regulations still have the potential to lower our safe yield, raise our capital and operating expenses and adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Because they affect only a subset of the Company\u2019s supplies and allow for releases to be scaled back in response to drought events, the overall impact is anticipated to be manageable. Costs associated with the regulations may be recovered in the form of higher rates. Although there can be no assurance PURA would approve rate increases to enable us to recover all such costs, legislation passed in 2013 allows for a WICA surcharge to recover capital improvement costs necessary to achieve compliance with the regulations.\nThe State of Maine also has regulations that govern the flow of water in rivers and streams and also govern lake levels on great ponds. Code of Maine Rules Chapter 587 (\u201cChapter 587\u201d) regulates any activity that alters the flow or level of classified state waters after August 2007. Maine Water operates five water systems that use surface waters governed by this chapter. Maine Water has operated in full compliance with the chapter since its effective date and fully expects continued compliance. For public water systems, Chapter 587 allows the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (\u201cMDEP\u201d) to impose site specific conditions in locations where Maine\u2019s water quality classifications are not being met. Any conditions proposed on a water withdrawal by a public water system must consider the provisions of any legislative charter, the watershed protection benefits provided by the utility and the financial viability of the utility. Further, any conditions imposed must be accommodated by the existing MPUC approved rate schedule for the utility and may not, in and of themselves, cause a utility to request a rate increase from their customers. To date, the MDEP has not imposed any withdrawal conditions on any public water system in Maine.\nMaine Water\u2019s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations which could adversely affect demand for its water services and its revenues.\nDemand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other outside water use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels. In the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues. As Maine Water becomes eligible to use the recently passed water revenue adjustment mechanism upon the expiration of the agreed upon stay out period, this risk will be mitigated.\nDeclining per customer residential water usage in the State of Maine and at Avon Water may reduce our revenues, financial condition and results of operations in future years.\nA trend of declining per customer residential water usage has been observed for the last several years, which we attribute to increased water conservation, including the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential users. Our regulated business in Maine and at Avon Water are heavily dependent on revenue generated from rates we charge to our residential customers for the volume of water they use. The rate we charge for our water is regulated by the MPUC in Maine and PURA in Connecticut and we may not unilaterally adjust our rates to reflect changes in demand. Declining volume of residential water usage may have a negative impact on our operating revenues in the future if regulators do not reflect any usage declines in the rate setting design process. As Maine Water and Avon Water become eligible to use the water revenue adjustment mechanism upon approval of regulatory agencies, this risk will be mitigated.\nPotential regulatory changes or drought conditions may impact our ability to serve our current and future customers\u2019 demand for water and our financial results.\nWe depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future demands of our customers. Changes in regulatory requirements could affect our ability to utilize existing supplies and/or secure new sources, as required. Insufficient supplies or an interruption in our water supply could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Drought conditions could interfere with our sources of water supply and could adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our existing and future customers. An interruption in our water supply could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, governmental restrictions on water usage during drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our water, even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our customers during these drought conditions, which may adversely affect our revenues and earnings at Maine Water. Persistent dry weather and continued drought conditions in 2016 in the State of Connecticut prompted Connecticut Water to join other major water utilities in the state and request that all customers voluntarily reduce their water usage by 10% in July 2016 in an effort to extend the availability of existing supplies and to support the rivers and streams in the state. While supplies in our reservoirs were lower than normal, Connecticut Water also has groundwater sources in nearly all of its water systems that provide operational flexibility so we are not solely dependent on our reservoirs for water supply. Connecticut Water encouraged all customers to reduce their water usage by 10% and, in October 2016, began asking customers in the shoreline communities of Guilford, Madison, Clinton, Westbrook and Old Saybrook to reduce their water usage by 15%. On April 21, 2017, the Company announced that all of our reservoirs in the State of Connecticut had returned to full capacity and that the previously announced water supply advisory has been lifted.\nWastewater operations entail significant risks and may impose significant costs.\nWastewater collection and treatment and septage pumping and sludge hauling involve various unique risks. If collection or treatment systems operated by HVWC fail or do not operate properly, or if there is a spill, untreated or partially treated wastewater could discharge onto property or into nearby streams and rivers, causing various damages and injuries, including environmental damage. These risks are most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding, which are the main causes of wastewater overflow and system failure. Liabilities resulting from such damages and injuries could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are increasingly dependent on the continuous and reliable operation of our information technology systems, and a disruption of these systems, resulting from cyber security attacks or other events, could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on our information technology systems in connection with the operation of our business, especially with respect to customer service and billing, accounting and, in some cases, the monitoring and operation of our treatment, storage and pumping facilities. In addition, we rely on our systems to track our utility assets and to manage maintenance and construction projects, materials and supplies, and our human resource functions. A loss of these systems, or major problems with the operation of these systems, could adversely affect our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from the following types of cyber security attacks or other events:\n\u2022\npower loss, computer systems failures, and internet, telecommunications or data network failures;\n\u2022\noperator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees;\n\u2022\nphysical and electronic loss of data;\n\u2022\ncomputer viruses, cyber security attacks, intentional security breaches, hacking, denial of service actions, misappropriation of data and similar events;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the implementation of upgrades or modification to our information technology systems; and\n\u2022\nhurricanes, fires, floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters.\nRecognizing the increasing importance of managing and protecting electronic data, the Company, beginning in 2014, partnered with a consulting firm to evaluate the Company's cyber security strengths and vulnerabilities and to help in creating an evaluation of the Company's current information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) structure within the organization. In April 2014, a cyber security assessment analysis identified and prioritized steps that the Company should take to enhance its security surrounding cyber security. In September 2014, the consultant delivered a report related to the IT structure which contained recommendations aimed at strengthening the IT organization. The Company has implemented the recommendations contained in the cyber security assessment. Since the implementation of those recommendations, the Company has focused on the following initiatives:\n\u2022\nCyber security architecture;\n\u2022\nDisaster recovery automation;\n\u2022\nWeb security;\n\u2022\nSystems controls;\n\u2022\nProgram awareness;\n\u2022\nCyber training for employees;\n\u2022\nPhishing campaigns;\n\u2022\nSystems patch management; and\n\u2022\nSupporting cyber policy for all projects or ongoing practices.\nAlthough we do not believe that our systems are at a materially greater risk of cyber security attacks than other similar organizations, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from the types of cyber security attacks or other events listed above or other similar actions, and such incidents or other events may go undetected for a period of time. Such cyber security attacks or other events may result in: the loss or compromise of customer, financial or operational data; disruption of billing, collections or normal field service activities; disruption of electronic monitoring and control of operational systems; and delays in financial reporting and other normal management functions. Possible impacts associated with a cyber security attack or other events may include remediation costs related to lost, stolen, or compromised data, repairs to data processing systems, increased cyber security protection costs, adverse effects on our compliance with regulatory and environmental laws and regulation, including standards for drinking water, litigation and reputational damage.\nThe failure of, or the requirement to repair, upgrade or dismantle, any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe own and operate numerous dams throughout the States of Connecticut and Maine. While the Company maintains robust dam maintenance and inspection programs, a failure of any of those dams could result in injuries and damage to residential and/or commercial property downstream for which we may be responsible, in whole or in part. The failure of a dam could also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Any losses or liabilities incurred due to the failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates.\nAny failure of our reservoirs, storage tanks, mains or distribution networks could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation.\nConnecticut Water and Maine Water distribute water through an extensive network of mains and stores water in reservoirs and storage tanks located across Connecticut and Maine. A failure of major mains, reservoirs, or tanks could result in injuries and damage to residential and/or commercial property for which we may be responsible, in whole or in part. The failure of major mains, reservoirs or tanks may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our water distribution network in order to conduct repairs. Such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water delivery requirements prescribed by governmental regulators, including PURA and the MPUC, and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and reputation. Any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates, and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates.\nAny future acquisitions we may undertake may involve risks and uncertainties.\nAn important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition and integration of water systems in order to move into new service areas and to broaden our current service areas. As of December 31, 2017, our Regulated Companies serve 135,645 customers, or a population of approximately 450,000 people, in 80 municipalities throughout Connecticut and Maine. We will be unable to acquire other businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates. It is our intent, when practical, to integrate any businesses we acquire with our existing operations. The negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our management\u2019s time and resources. Future acquisitions by us could result in:\n\u2022\ndilutive issuances of our equity securities;\n\u2022\nincurrence of debt and contingent liabilities;\n\u2022\nfailure to have effective internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in quarterly results; and\n\u2022\nother acquisition-related expenses.\nSome or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business as well as our ability to finance our business and comply with regulatory requirements. The businesses we acquire, including HVWC and Avon Water acquired in 2017, may not\nachieve sales and profitability that would justify our investment and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process, including the integration of controls necessary for internal control and financial reporting, could interfere with our operations, reduce our operating margins and adversely affect our internal controls. In addition, as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries, the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to grow through acquisitions.\nWater supply contamination may adversely affect our business.\nOur water supplies are subject to possible contamination, including contamination from the development of naturally-occurring compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting from man-made sources, and possible terrorist attacks. In the event that our water supply is contaminated, we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source or provide additional treatment. We may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities, or development of new treatment methods. If we are unable to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source, or to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost-effective manner, there may be an adverse effect on our revenues, operating results and financial condition. The costs we incur to decontaminate a water source or an underground water system could be significant and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition and may not be recoverable in rates. We could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage. For example, private plaintiffs have the right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies. Our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims.\nAttention is being given to emerging contaminants, including, without limitation, chemicals and other substances that currently do not have any regulatory standard in drinking water or have been recently created or discovered (including by means of scientific achievements in the analysis and detection of trace amounts of substances). Examples of sources of emerging contaminants include, but are not limited to, newly created chemical compounds (including, for example, perfluorinated compounds and manufactured nanomaterials); human and veterinary products; microbes, viruses, amoebae and other pathogens; and residual by-products of disinfection. We rely upon governmental agencies to set appropriate regulatory standards to protect the public from these and other contaminants. Our role is to meet or surpass those standards, when established. PURA and/or MPUC may disapprove of cost recovery, in whole or in part, for implementation of treatment infrastructure for an emerging contaminant in the absence of a regulatory standard. Furthermore, depending on the regulatory standards and implementation schedules that might be established for any emerging contaminants, we may not be able to detect and/or mitigate all such substances in our drinking water system or supplies in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and reputation. In addition, we believe emerging contaminants may form the basis for additional or increased federal or state regulatory initiatives and requirements in the future, which could significantly increase the cost of our operations.\nWe operate a number of water and wastewater systems under Operation and Maintenance (\u201cO&M\u201d) contracts and face the risk that the owners of those systems may fail to provide capital to properly maintain those systems, which may negatively affect us as the operators of the systems.\nWe operate a number of water systems under O&M contracts. Pursuant to these contracts, we operate the system according to the standards set forth in the applicable contract, and it is generally the responsibility of the owner of the system to undertake capital improvements. In some cases, we may not be able to convince the owner to make needed improvements in order to maintain compliance with applicable regulations. Although violations and fines incurred by water and wastewater systems may be the responsibility of the owner of the system under these contracts, those non-compliance events may reflect poorly on us as the operator of the system and damage our reputation, and in some cases, may result in liability to the same extent as if we were the owner.\nIncreased security measures may continue to increase our operating costs.\nIn addition to the potential pollution of our water supply as described above, we have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply. We have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business. We have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities, operations and supplies. These costs may be significant. We are currently not aware of any specific threats to our facilities, operations or supplies; however, it is possible that we would not be in a position to control the outcome of terrorist events should they occur.\nThe accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will impact our operating results and financial condition.\nWe make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements regarding, among others:\n\u2022\nthe number of years to depreciate certain assets;\n\u2022\namounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable and uninsured losses;\n\u2022\nour legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims, including medical and workers\u2019 compensation claims;\n\u2022\nfuture costs for pensions and other post-retirement benefit obligations; and\n\u2022\npossible tax allowances.\nThe quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will have an impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs at the end of each accounting period. If our estimates are not accurate, we will be required to make an adjustment in a future period.\nThe final determination of our income tax liability may be materially different from our income tax provision.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. Our calculation of the provision for income taxes is subject to our interpretation of applicable business tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file. In addition, our income tax returns are subject to periodic examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities. During 2013 and 2014, Connecticut Water and Maine Water, respectively, changed their tax method of accounting to permit the expensing of qualifying utility asset costs that were previously being capitalized and depreciated for tax purposes. Our determination of what qualifies as a capital cost versus a repair expense tax deduction is subject to subsequent adjustment and may impact the income tax benefits that have been recognized. Although we believe our income tax estimates, including any tax reserves or valuation allowances we have recorded or may record, are appropriate, there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different; either higher or lower, from what is reflected in our income tax provision. In the event we are assessed additional income taxes, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, new Federal, state and local laws, changes in existing laws, rules or regulations, or administrative interpretations thereof, could impact us. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Act\u201d) was signed into law, which, among other things, enacted significant and complex changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, including a reduction in the maximum U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% as of January 1, 2018, and certain other provisions related specifically to the public utility industry, including continuation of interest expense deductibility, the exclusion from utilizing bonus depreciation and the normalization of deferred income taxes. The enactment of the Tax Act required a re-measurement of our deferred income taxes that impacted our 2017 results of operations and financial position. We have assumed that the predominant majority of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at our utility subsidiaries will remain subject to a normalization method of accounting pursuant to the U.S. tax code or applicable regulations and that we will be able to deduct for U.S. federal corporate income tax purposes substantially all of our interest expense, based upon our interpretation of U.S. tax law debt allocation methodologies, at the Tax Act\u2019s 21% corporate tax rate. The adoption or issuance of any related interpretations that impact these assumptions or with respect to provisions related specifically to the public utility industry or to corporate taxpayers in general may also impact our future financial performance, including our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity, which impacts will largely be determined through future regulatory proceedings. Both PURA and MPUC have opened formal proceedings related to the Tax Act in which the Regulated Companies are participating. At this time, we cannot predict the impacts of any Related Interpretations, if and when issued, on us, or the regulatory treatment of the Tax Act in each of our regulatory jurisdictions. Moreover, we are unable to determine or predict the potential impacts, if any, of any other new or amended laws, rules or regulations, or interpretations thereof, to the extent they may be ultimately enacted, adopted or issued, on us or our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nKey employee turnover may adversely affect our operating results.\nOur success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team. The loss of the services of any member or our senior management team or the inability to hire and retain experienced management personnel could harm our operating results.\nWe must continue to attract and retain qualified technical and managerial personnel in order to succeed.\nOur future success will also depend largely upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, operational and financial managers. There is significant competition for such personnel in our industry. We try to ensure that we offer competitive compensation and benefits as well as opportunities for continued development, and we continually strive to recruit and train qualified personnel and retain key employees. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we require to grow and operate profitably.", "PERMNO": 26463, "SIC": 4941, "TIC": "CTWS"}
