{"cik": "1409171", "company": "Titan Machinery Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-04-07", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe are substantially dependent upon CNH Industrial, our primary supplier of equipment and parts inventory.\nThe substantial majority of our business involves the sale and distribution of new equipment and after-market parts supplied by CNH Industrial and the servicing of equipment manufactured by CNH Industrial. In fiscal 2020, CNH Industrial supplied approximately 74% of the new equipment sold in our Agriculture segment, 70% of the new equipment sold in our Construction segment, and 62% of the new equipment sold in our International segment, and supplied a significant portion of our parts inventory.\nIn addition to being our primary supplier, CNH Industrial provides us with the following important inputs for our business:\n\u2022\nFloorplan payable financing for the purchase of a substantial portion of our equipment inventory;\n\u2022\nRetail financing used by many of our customers to purchase CNH Industrial equipment from us;\n\u2022\nReimbursement for warranty work performed by us pursuant to CNH\u2019s product warranties;\n\u2022\nIncentive programs and discount programs offered from time to time that enable us to price our products more competitively; and\n\u2022\nPromotional and marketing activities on national, regional and local levels.\nOur financial performance and future success are highly dependent on the overall reputation, brand and success of CNH Industrial in the agricultural and construction equipment manufacturing industries, including its ability to maintain a competitive position in product innovation, product quality, and product pricing, and its ability to continue to provide financing to both us and our retail customers, and warranty reimbursements for service work that we perform.\nCNH Industrial may change or terminate our CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements.\nWe have entered into CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements under which we sell CNH Industrial\u2019s branded agricultural and construction equipment, along with after-market parts and repair services. Subject to applicable state statutes that may govern the dealer-manufacturer legal relationship, CNH Industrial may terminate our CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements immediately in certain circumstances, following written notice and cure periods for certain breaches of the agreement, and for\nany reason under the Case Construction agreement following 120 days prior written notice. If CNH Industrial were to terminate all or any of its CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements with us, our business would be severely harmed.\nFurthermore, CNH Industrial may unilaterally change its operating practices under the terms of its CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements with us to, among other things, change or authorize additional dealers in our sales and service areas, change its distribution system to the detriment of its dealers like us, limit our product offerings, and change pricing or delivery terms. If CNH Industrial were to change the terms of our CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements or its operating practices in a manner that adversely affects us, our business and results of operations would be harmed.\nOur CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements impose obligations and restrictions on us.\nUnder our CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements, we are obligated to actively promote the sale of CNH Industrial equipment within our designated geographic areas of responsibility, fulfill the product warranty obligations of CNH Industrial (subject to CNH Industrial\u2019s payment to us of the agreed upon reimbursement), maintain adequate facilities and workforce to service the needs of our customers, and maintain equipment and parts inventories at the level deemed necessary by CNH Industrial to meet sales goals as stated in the annual business plan mutually agreed upon by us and CNH Industrial, maintain adequate working capital, and maintain stores only in authorized locations. Our CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements do not provide us with exclusive dealerships in any territory (except in our European territories), and CNH Industrial could elect to authorize additional dealers in our market areas in the future, subject to state dealer protection laws.\nConsent of CNH Industrial is required for certain material changes in our ownership, governance or business structure, including the acquisition by any person or group of persons of 30% or more of our outstanding stock or 20% or more of our outstanding stock if the person or group is a competitor of CNH Industrial. This requirement may have the effect of discouraging a sale or other change in control of the Company, including transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests.\nThe acquisition of additional CNH Industrial geographic areas of responsibility and store locations in our Agriculture, Construction and International segments requires the consent of CNH Industrial under our CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements, subject to contrary state dealer protection laws. CNH Industrial may decide to decline, in its sole discretion, to consent to any acquisition of an additional CNH Industrial store location we may pursue. If CNH Industrial is unwilling to consent to any future proposed acquisition of additional dealerships, our ability to execute on our acquisition strategy and to grow our business may be impaired. We cannot assume that CNH Industrial will consent to any acquisition of stores or dealerships that we may desire to make in the future.\nOur CNH Industrial Dealer Agreements require us to operate any material business activities not related to sales of CNH Industrial products or services to customers in agricultural, construction, industrial or similar markets separately from our CNH Industrial dealership business. Our CNH Industrial Dealer Agreement for Case Construction equipment prohibits us from carrying other suppliers' products (new equipment and parts) at our Case Construction stores that are competitive with CNH Industrial's products. These restrictions may discourage or prevent us from pursuing business activities that we believe are in the best interests of our stockholders.\nOur agricultural equipment, parts and service sales are affected by numerous market factors outside of our control.\nFarmers' capital expenditures often follow a cyclical pattern, with increased capital investments typically occurring during boom cycles spurred by high net farm income and strong farmer balance sheets. The USDA has forecasted net farm income, a broad measure of farm profitability, to be $93.6 billion for calendar year 2019, which is approximately 18.1% above the average for the five-year period ended December 31, 2019. Net farm income is subject to numerous external factors that are beyond the control of the individual farmer such as commodity prices, import tariffs and other trade regulations including developments in U.S.-China trade relations, input costs, production yields, animal diseases and crop pests, federal crop insurance and subsidy programs. Net farm income also impacts farmland values, which causes overall farm wealth to increase or decrease, impacting farmers\u2019 sentiment to make investments in equipment. The nature of the agricultural industry is such that a downturn in equipment demand can occur suddenly, resulting in negative impact on dealers including declining revenues, reduced profit margins, excess new and used equipment inventories, and increased floorplan interest expenses. These downturns may be prolonged, and during these periods, our revenues and profitability could be harmed. Demand for our parts and service, although not as cyclical as equipment purchases, also can be negatively affected in agricultural downturns and in regions affected by adverse weather or growing conditions which result in fewer acres planted or harvested.\nOur construction equipment, parts and service sales are affected by numerous market factors outside of our control.\nOur construction equipment customers primarily operate in the natural resource development, construction, transportation, agriculture, manufacturing, industrial processing and utilities industries, which industries generally are capital intensive and cyclical in nature. Many of our construction equipment customers are directly and indirectly affected by\nfluctuations in commodity prices in the agriculture, forestry, metals and minerals, petroleum and natural gas industries. Prolonged periods of low oil prices, natural gas prices and other commodity prices may cause reduced activity in these sectors which may result in decreased demand for our products and services by our customers operating in these industries.\nConstruction contractors' demand for our construction equipment, parts and repair services is affected by economic conditions at both a global and a local level. Economic conditions that negatively affect the construction industry, such as the tightening of credit standards which affect the ability of consumers or businesses to obtain financing for construction projects, could reduce our customers' demand for our construction equipment. The construction industry in many of our geographical areas has experienced periodic, and sometimes prolonged, economic down cycles, which negatively impacts sales of construction equipment in those markets. During these downturns our revenues and profitability could be harmed.\nActual or threatened epidemics, pandemics, outbreaks, or other public health crises could result in disruptions in our supply chain, decreased customer demand, lower oil and other commodity prices and volatility in the stock market and the global economy, which could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nActual or threatened epidemics, pandemics, outbreaks, or other public health crises could materially and adversely impact or disrupt our operations, adversely affect the local economies where we operate and negatively impact our customers\u2019 spending in the impacted regions or depending upon the severity, globally, which could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, since December 2019, a strain of novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) surfaced in China and has spread into the United States, Europe and several other parts of the world, resulting in certain supply chain disruptions, volatilities in the stock market, lower oil and other commodity prices due to diminished demand, economic challenges for ethanol producers, and lockdown on international travels, all of which could adversely impact the global economy and result in decreased demand from our customers. There is significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of the business disruptions related to COVID-19, as well as its impact on the U.S. economy. Moreover, an epidemic, pandemic, outbreak or other public health crisis, such as COVID-19, could adversely affect our ability to adequately staff and manage our business. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, rapidly changing and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact.\nOur customers\u2019 ability to obtain affordable financing is an important factor in their purchasing decisions, and directly affects our business.\nThe ability to obtain affordable financing is an important part of a customer's decision to purchase agricultural or construction equipment. As net farm income and farm wealth have decreased in recent years, the borrowing capacity of our farmer customers may have also decreased. Moreover, in a tighter credit environment, agricultural lenders may discourage their farmer customers from making non-essential capital expenditures.\nInterest rate increases may make equipment purchases less affordable for customers and, as a result, our revenue and profitability may decrease. We are unable to anticipate the timing and impact of interest rate adjustments.\nChanges in governmental policies may reduce demand for agricultural and construction equipment and cause our revenue to decline.\nChanges in federal, state, and international agricultural policies could adversely affect sales of agricultural equipment. Government programs and subsidies that reduce economic volatility, incentivize agricultural equipment purchases, and enhance farm income positively influence farmers' demand for agricultural equipment. To the extent that future funding or farm programs available to individual farmers are reduced, or, in the case of the U.S. Federal government's market facilitation program, this program is not renewed, these changes could reduce demand for agricultural equipment and we could experience a decline in revenue. Government sponsored conservation programs could remove acres from agricultural production, reducing demand for our products and services. Changes in government spending on infrastructure projects could adversely affect the demand for construction equipment and we could experience a decline in revenue. The ability to export agricultural products is critical to our agriculture customers. As a result, tariffs and other government trade agreements, policies or regulations impacting or limiting the export or import of agricultural commodities, such as China's import tariffs, could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities, which may cause a decrease in the demand for agricultural equipment. Furthermore, the U.S. federal government has initiated tariffs, such as the current steel tariff, on certain foreign goods, including raw materials, commodities, and products manufactured outside the United States that are used in our manufacturers\u2019 production processes. These tariffs could in turn increase our cost of sales as a result of price increases implemented by our domestic suppliers, which we may not be able to pass on to our customers.\nThe equipment distribution market is subject to supply-demand imbalances arising from factors over which we have no control.\nOver-production of equipment by one or more manufacturers, or a sudden reduction in demand for equipment, can dramatically disrupt the equipment market and cause downward pressure on our equipment profit margins. Customer leasing arrangements in the agriculture and construction equipment industries may also impact the level of industry-wide equipment inventory supplies. When leased equipment comes off lease, there may be an increase in the availability of late-model used equipment, which can create an inventory over-supply condition and put pressure on our equipment sales and margins, and have an adverse effect on values of our used equipment inventory and rental fleet equipment. Similarly, rental house companies engage in regular sales of rental fleet units, which can further disrupt the supply-demand balance. However, we have no control over or ability to significantly influence any of the foregoing inputs into the equipment distribution markets, but expect that we will be subject to the negative impact, including downward pressure on equipment profit margins, resulting from any supply-demand imbalances arising therefrom.\nOur financial performance is dependent on our ability to effectively manage our inventory.\nOur agricultural and construction equipment dealership network requires substantial inventories of equipment and parts to be maintained at each store and company-wide to facilitate sales to customers on a timely basis. Our equipment inventory has traditionally represented 50% or more of our total assets. We need to maintain a proper balance of new and used equipment to assure satisfactory inventory turnover and to minimize floorplan financing costs.\nOur purchases of new equipment and parts are based primarily on projected demand. If actual sales are materially less than our forecasts, for example, because of the unexpected effects on consumer demand caused by COVID-19, we would experience an over-supply of new equipment inventory. An over-supply of new equipment inventory will generally cause downward pressure on our product sale prices and margins, decrease our inventory turns, and increase our floorplan financing expenses.\nOur used equipment is generally acquired as \u201ctrade-ins\u201d from customers in connection with equipment sales to those customers. Equipment inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Adjustments to market value of inventory are recognized as a cost of sales, negatively impacting earnings, in the periods in which they occur. Our estimates of market value for our used equipment, as determined at the time of the trade-in, may prove to be inaccurate, given the potential for sudden change in market conditions and other factors beyond our control. Changes from our normal retail marketing channel to more aggressive marketing channels for specific pieces or categories of equipment inventory, particularly as equipment inventory ages, will generally result in lower sales prices. Pricing and sales of used equipment can be significantly affected by the limited market for certain types of used equipment.\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks.\nWe currently operate dealership locations in Bulgaria, Germany, Romania, Serbia and Ukraine. In fiscal 2020, total International segment revenues were 18.1% of our consolidated total revenue. As of January 31, 2020, total International segment assets were 19.6% of our consolidated total assets.\nOur operations in international markets subject us to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory environments and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate. Risks inherent in our international operations include:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in implementing our business model in foreign markets;\n\u2022\ncosts and diversion of domestic management attention related to oversight of international operations;\n\u2022\nunexpected adverse changes in export duties, quotas and tariffs and difficulties in obtaining import licenses;\n\u2022\ncyclicality of demand in European Union member states for agricultural equipment, based on availability of European Union government subsidy programs and tax incentives;\n\u2022\nunexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ncompliance with a variety of tax regulations, foreign laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other U.S. laws that apply to the international operations of U.S. companies which may be difficult and costly to implement and monitor, can create competitive disadvantages if our competitors are not subject to such laws, and which, if violated, may result in substantial financial and reputational harm;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates to which we are exposed may adversely affect the results of our operations, the value of our foreign assets and liabilities and our cash flows;\n\u2022\nthe laws of the European countries in which we operate, unlike U.S. states, do not include specific dealer protection laws and, therefore, we may be more susceptible to actions of suppliers that are adverse to our interests such as termination of our dealer agreements for any reason or installing additional dealers in our designated territories; and\n\u2022\ngeo-political or economic instability.\nAny escalation of political tensions or economic instability in Ukraine, including as a result of heightened tensions between Ukraine and the Russian Federation, could create significant disruption in our Ukrainian operations and may have an adverse effect on our business operations in Ukraine. Previous periods of political tension and economic instability in Ukraine caused liquidity problems for our customers, which negatively impacted their purchasing decisions for our products and services, limited our ability to maintain working capital loans or increased the cost of maintaining such loans, and as a result of imposed currency exchange controls, restricted our ability to manage our cash held in Ukraine and our investment in our Ukrainian business. Our operations in Ukraine are subject to the risks of further devaluation of the local currency, increased interest rates and increased inflation.\nThese factors, in addition to others that we have not anticipated, may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nFloorplan financing for our equipment inventory may not be available on favorable terms, which would adversely affect our growth and results of operations.\nWe generally purchase our equipment with the assistance of floorplan payable financing programs through CNH Industrial Capital and our other credit facilities. In the event that our available financing sources are insufficient to satisfy our future requirements, we would be required to obtain financing from other sources. We may not be able to obtain this additional or alternative financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all. To the extent that this financing cannot be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our growth and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur level of indebtedness could limit our financial and operational flexibility.\nAs of January 31, 2020, our indebtedness included floorplan payable financing, real estate mortgage financing arrangements that are secured by real estate assets and other long-term debt. In addition, we have obligations under our lease agreements for our store locations and corporate headquarters.\nOur level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes.\nWe expect to use cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our operations, debt service and capital expenditures. However, our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which may be beyond our control.\nThe credit agreements governing our indebtedness restrict our ability to engage in certain corporate and financial transactions, and require us to satisfy financial covenants.\nThe credit agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that, among other things, may limit or place conditions on our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur more debt;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate, or make certain acquisitions;\n\u2022\ntransfer and sell assets;\n\u2022\npay dividends or repurchase stock; and\n\u2022\nissue equity instruments.\nOur credit facilities with CNH Industrial Capital and DLL Finance require us to satisfy a net leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio on an ongoing basis, measured at the end of each fiscal quarter. Under the Bank Syndicate Credit Facility, if our excess availability (i.e., borrowing base capacity less outstanding loan balance and certain reserves) falls below a certain threshold, we become subject to a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. Our ability to borrow under these credit agreements depends upon compliance with these financial covenants.\nOur failure to satisfy any covenant, absent a waiver or amendment, would cause us to be in default under our credit facilities and would enable our lenders to accelerate payment of the outstanding indebtedness. Each of our credit agreements include cross-default provisions which state that certain types of defaults under any other indebtedness agreement will also constitute a default under that credit agreement. If an event of default occurred, and the lender demanded accelerated payment, we may not be able to satisfy a pay-off request, whether through internal funds or a new financing.\nOur variable rate indebtedness exposes us to interest rate risk.\nA substantial portion of our floorplan and working capital borrowings, including the credit facilities with CNH Industrial Capital, the Bank Syndicate, DLL Finance, and our international floorplan facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. As such, our results of operations are sensitive to movements in interest rates. There are many economic factors outside our control that have in the past and may, in the future, impact rates of interest including publicly announced indices that underlie the interest obligations related to a certain portion of our debt. Factors that impact interest rates include governmental monetary policies, inflation, recession, changes in unemployment, the money supply, and international instability impacting domestic and foreign financial markets. Any increases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions and results of operations.\nChanges affecting the availability of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) may have consequences for the Company that cannot yet reasonably be predicted.\nThe Company has outstanding credit facilities, including the Bank Syndicate Credit Facility and the Company\u2019s credit facility with DLL Finance, with variable interest rates based on LIBOR. The LIBOR benchmark has been subject of national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for calculation of LIBOR after 2021. These reforms may cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past and LIBOR may ultimately cease to exist after 2021. Alternative benchmark rate(s) may replace LIBOR and could affect the Company\u2019s credit facilities. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any changes to LIBOR, any phase out of LIBOR or any establishment of alternative benchmark rates. Any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate LIBOR exactly. Any changes to benchmark rates may have an uncertain impact on our cost of funds and our access to the capital markets, which could impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system, and problems with the design or implementation of this ERP system could interfere with our business and operations.\nWe are engaged in the implementation of a new ERP system. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain the Company\u2019s books and records and provide information to the Company\u2019s management team important to the operation of our business. The Company\u2019s ERP transition has required, and will continue to require, the investment of significant human and financial resources. We may not be able to successfully implement the ERP transition without experiencing delays, increased costs and other difficulties. Beyond cost and scheduling, potential flaws in the implementation of an ERP system may pose risks to the Company\u2019s ability to operate successfully and efficiently, including timely and accurate SEC filings. If we are unable to successfully implement the new ERP system as planned, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nThe agricultural and construction equipment industries are highly seasonal, which can cause significant fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flow.\nThe agricultural and construction equipment businesses are highly seasonal, which causes our quarterly results to fluctuate during the year. Farmers generally purchase agricultural equipment and service work in preparation for, or in conjunction with, the spring planting and fall harvesting seasons. Construction equipment customers\u2019 purchases of equipment and service work, as well as rental of equipment, are also seasonal in our stores located in colder climates where construction work slows significantly in the winter months. In addition, the fourth quarter typically is a significant period for equipment sales in the U.S. because of our customers\u2019 year-end tax planning considerations, the timing of dealer incentives and the increase in availability of farmers\u2019 funds from completed harvests and construction customers' funds from completed projects. Also, numerous external factors such as credit markets, commodity prices, weather conditions, and other circumstances may disrupt normal purchasing practices and customers\u2019 sentiment, further contributing to the seasonal fluctuations.\nWeather conditions may negatively impact the agricultural and construction equipment markets and affect our financial results.\nWeather conditions, particularly severe floods and droughts, can have a significant adverse effect on growing conditions and on regional agricultural and construction markets. Adverse weather conditions may result in fewer acres being planted or harvested by farmers and reduced crop yields on those acres that are planted. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by adverse weather conditions.\nOur rental operations subject us to risks including increased maintenance costs as our rental fleet ages, increased costs of new replacement equipment we use in our fleet, and losses upon disposition of rental fleet units.\nOur rental fleet margins are materially impacted by utilization of fleet assets, which is seasonal and can fluctuate materially due to weather and economic factors. If our rental equipment ages, the costs of maintaining that equipment, if not replaced within a certain period of time, will likely increase. The cost of new equipment for use in our rental fleet could also increase due to increased material costs for our suppliers or other factors beyond our control. Furthermore, changes in customer demand could cause some of our existing equipment to become obsolete and require us to purchase new equipment at increased costs.\nUpon the sale of a rental fleet unit, we include in operating income the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of the equipment sold. The market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold. The market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors, including:\n\u2022\nmarket prices for like equipment;\n\u2022\nhours and condition of the equipment;\n\u2022\ntime of year that the equipment is sold;\n\u2022\nthe supply of used equipment in the market; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nAny significant decline in the selling prices for used rental equipment, or increased costs resulting from our rental operations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and cash flow.\nOur industry is highly competitive.\nThe agricultural and construction equipment distribution (including parts and service) and rental industries are highly competitive and fragmented, with large numbers of companies operating on a regional or local basis. Historically, our competitors have competed aggressively on the basis of pricing or inventory availability, resulting in decreased margins on our sales to the extent we choose to match our competitors' pricing. To the extent we choose not to match or remain within a reasonable competitive distance from our competitors' pricing, we may lose sales volume and market share. In addition, to the extent CNH Industrial's competitors (such as Deere, Caterpillar, Komatsu, Volvo, and AGCO) provide their dealers with more innovative or higher quality products, better customer financing, or have more effective marketing programs or the CNH Industrial reputation or brand are tarnished in the marketplace or with our customers, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, e-commerce companies selling parts have negatively impacted dealers' parts sales and margins, and it is expected that this competitive pressure will only continue to increase in the future.\nIf our acquisition plans are unsuccessful, we may not achieve our planned long-term revenue growth.\nOur ability to grow through the acquisition of additional CNH Industrial geographic areas of responsibility and store locations or other businesses will be dependent upon the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable values, our ability to compete effectively for available acquisition candidates and the availability of capital to complete the acquisitions. We may not successfully identify suitable targets, or if we do, we may not be able to close the transactions, or if we close the transactions, they may not be profitable. In addition, CNH Industrial's consent is required for the acquisition of any CNH Industrial dealership, and the consent of our lenders may be required for certain acquisitions. CNH Industrial typically evaluates management, historical performance, and capitalization of a prospective acquirer in determining whether to consent to the sale of a CNH Industrial dealership. There can be no assurance that CNH Industrial or our lenders will consent to any acquisitions of dealerships that we may propose.\nOur acquisitions may not be successful.\nThere are risks associated with acquisitions of new dealerships. These risks include incurring significantly higher than anticipated capital expenditures and operating expenses; failing to assimilate the operations and personnel of the acquired dealerships; disrupting our ongoing business; diluting the effectiveness of our management; failing to maintain uniform\nstandards, controls and policies; and impairing relationships with employees and customers as a result of changes in management. To the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems related to acquisitions, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Future acquisitions also may have a significant impact on our financial position and capital needs, and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly results of operations. Acquisitions could include significant goodwill and intangible assets, which may result in future impairment charges that would reduce our stated earnings.\nWe are exposed to customer credit risks.\nWe extend credit to our customers for parts and service work, rental charges, and also for some equipment sales in our domestic and international operations. If we are unable to manage credit risk issues adequately, or if a large number of customers should have financial difficulties at the same time, our credit losses could increase above historical levels and our operating results would be adversely affected. Delinquencies and credit losses generally would be expected to increase if there was a worsening of economic conditions.\nOur business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel.\nOur success in executing our operating and strategic plans depends on the efforts and abilities of our management team and key employees, including the managers of our field operations and our country managers in our International operations. The failure to attract and retain members of our management team and key employees will harm us.\nOver the past several months, the equipment industry has experienced a shortage of qualified service technicians. If this trend worsens and we are not able to hire and retain qualified service technicians at acceptable levels, our ability to satisfy customers' service needs would be negatively impacted. Moreover, the technician shortage may increase our service technician compensation expense, and reduce our gross margins on service work.\nSelling and renting agricultural and construction equipment, selling parts, and providing repair services subject us to liability risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and reputation.\nProducts sold, rented or serviced by us may expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or property damage claims that arise from the use of such products. Our commercial liability insurance may not be adequate to cover significant product liability claims, or we may not be able to secure such insurance on economically reasonable terms. An uninsured or partially insured claim for which indemnification from the manufacturer is not available could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Furthermore, if any significant claims are made against us or against CNH Industrial or any of our other suppliers, our business may be adversely affected by any related negative publicity or any adverse impact on the reputation or brand of any of our suppliers, including CNH Industrial.\nLabor organizing and other activities could negatively impact us.\nThe unionization of all or a substantial portion of our workforce could result in work slowdowns or stoppages, could increase our overall costs, could reduce our operating margins and reduce the efficiency of our operations at the affected locations, could adversely affect our flexibility to run our business competitively, and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future.\nThe price at which our common stock trades may be volatile and could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to our operating results and financial condition as set forth in our earnings releases, guidance estimates released by agricultural or construction equipment manufacturers that serve the markets in which we operate, announcements by our competitors, analyst recommendations, our ability to meet or exceed analysts\u2019 or investors\u2019 expectations, fluctuations in the price of crop commodities and natural resources, the condition of the financial markets, and other factors. Quarterly fluctuations resulting from the seasonality of our business may cause our results of operations and cash flows to underperform in relation to our quarterly modeling assumptions or the expectations of financial analysts or investors, which may cause volatility or decreases in our stock price.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price is dependent in part on the multiple of earnings that investors are willing to pay. That multiple is in part dependent on investors\u2019 perception of the Company\u2019s future earnings growth prospects. If investors\u2019 perception of the Company\u2019s earnings growth prospects change, the Company\u2019s earnings multiple may decline, and its stock price could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock notwithstanding our actual operating performance.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems. We use information technology systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Additionally, in the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including proprietary business information, of our customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks and the systems of the third parties with whom we do business and the processing and maintenance of information is critical to our operations. Despite our and the third parties with whom we do business' security measures and business continuity plans, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions arising from power outages, telecommunication failures, terrorist acts, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of these events could compromise our networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws that protect the privacy of personally identifiable information, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In particular, given our Europe operations, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation imposes stringent data protection requirement and provides significant penalties for noncompliance. In addition, as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication, we may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of our systems.\nWe maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses from any future breaches of our systems.", "PERMNO": 92471, "SIC": 5500, "TIC": "TITN"}
