{"cik": "1551693", "company": "Sientra, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and related notes, before deciding whether to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or growth prospects or cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this report and those we may make from time to time. You should consider all of the risk factors described when evaluating our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry\nWe have incurred significant net operating losses since inception and cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant net operating losses. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $558.9 million. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through sales of preferred stock, borrowings under our term loans and convertible note, sales of our products since 2012, our initial public offering and follow-on public offerings of our common stock. We have devoted substantially all of our resources to the acquisition and clinical development of our products, the commercial launch of our products, the development of a sales and marketing team and the assembly of a management team to manage our business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our net loss was $89.9 million. The extent of our future operating losses and the timing of profitability are uncertain. We will need to generate significant sales to achieve profitability, and we might not be able to do so. Even if we do generate significant sales, we might not be able to achieve, sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. If our sales grow more slowly than we have forecasted, or if our operating expenses exceed our forecasts, our financial performance and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and continues to adversely affect, our business, our operations and our financial results. Future pandemics, epidemics or outbreaks of an infectious disease may similarly affect our business, our operations and our financial results.\nThe rapid, global spread of COVID-19 has resulted in significant economic uncertainty, significant declines in business and consumer confidence and global demand in the non-essential healthcare industry (among others), a global economic slowdown, and could lead to a global recession. The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically impacted healthcare systems in the United States and globally and resulted in travel restrictions which impact medical tourism and our sales professionals\u2019 ability to travel. In addition, hospitals have limited access for non-patients, including our sales professionals, which could negatively impact our access to physicians. As an aesthetics company, a significant percentage of our products are utilized in elective surgeries or procedures, which may be deferred or avoided altogether due to the COVID-19 outbreak, materially impacting our financial results. Future pandemics or other outbreaks of infectious disease may result in a similar period of business disruption, including reduced sales as patients might cancel or defer elective procedures or otherwise avoid medical facilities, resulting in reduced patient volumes and operating revenues. Governmental agencies and hospital administrators may also instruct hospitals to postpone some elective procedures in preparation for COVID-19-related hospitalizations. Further, the spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our workforce practices, and we may take further actions that we determine are in the best interests of our employees or as required by governments. The continued spread of COVID-19, or another infectious disease, could also result in delays or disruptions in our supply chain or adversely affect our manufacturing facilities and personnel. Additionally, COVID-19 may impact our ability to effectively manage oversight and monitoring in relation to our ongoing compliance activities. Further, trade and/or national security protection policies may be adjusted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as actions by governments that limit, restrict or prevent the movement of certain goods into a country and/or region, and current U.S./China trade relations may be further exacerbated by the pandemic. The COVID-19 outbreak has materially impacted our operations and financial results and continues to be fluid and uncertain, making it difficult to forecast the final impact it could have on our future operations or financial results.\nWe may not successfully integrate newly acquired businesses or product lines into our business operations or realize the benefits of partnerships with other companies, acquisitions of complementary products or technologies or other strategic alternatives.\nWe have completed a series of business and product acquisitions including our acquisition of our manufacturing operations from Vesta, our acquisition of miraDry, and a series of our product acquisitions, including BIOCORNEUM and our Allox2 and Dermaspan tissue expanders portfolio. As a result of these acquisitions, we have undergone substantial changes to our business and product offerings in a short period of time. In addition, in the future, we may consider other opportunities to partner with or acquire other businesses, products or technologies that may enhance our product platform or technology, expand the breadth of our markets or customer base or advance our business strategies.\nIntegrating the business practice and operations of a new business with that of our own is a complex, costly and time-consuming process, which requires significant management attention and resources. The integration process may disrupt our existing operations and, if implemented ineffectively, would preclude realization of the full benefits expected by us. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating our acquisitions in order to realize the anticipated benefits may cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our operating activities and could adversely affect our results of operations. Potential difficulties, costs and delays we may encounter as part of the integration process may include:\n\u2022\ndistracting management from day-to-day operations;\n\u2022\npotential incompatibility of corporate cultures;\n\u2022\nan inability to achieve synergies as planned;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with the assumption of contingent or other liabilities of acquisition targets;\n\u2022\nadverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers or customers;\n\u2022\ninheriting and uncovering previously unknown issues, problems and costs from the acquired company;\n\u2022\nuncertainties associated with entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience;\n\u2022\nincreased legal and accounting costs relating to the partnership or acquisition or compliance with regulatory matters;\n\u2022\ndelays between our expenditures to acquire new products, technologies or businesses and the generation of net sales from those acquired products, technologies or businesses;\n\u2022\nrealization of assets and settlement of liabilities at amounts equal to estimated fair value as of the acquisition date of any acquisition or disposition;\n\u2022\ncosts and delays in implementing common systems and procedures (including technology, compliance programs, financial systems, distribution and general business operations, among others); and\n\u2022\nincreased difficulties in managing our business due to the addition of international locations.\nAny one or all of these factors may increase operating costs or lower anticipated financial performance. Many of these factors are also outside of our control. In addition, even if new business operations are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect or within the anticipated time frame. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses. All of these factors could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the transaction, and negatively impact the price of our common stock. The failure to integrate the business operations of miraDry or any acquired business successfully would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As noted above, we determined to refocus efforts on driving sales of bioTips to our existing installed base. There can be no assurance that this shift in focus will allow us to realize the expected benefits from this acquisition.\nIf we are unable to drive sales of our bioTips to our existing installed base of miraDry systems, our business and future prospects will be harmed.\nIn April 2020, we determined to focus to drive bioTip utilization to our existing installed base. We expect that the net sales we generate from our bioTips will represent substantially all of our miraDry segment\u2019s net sales for the next several years. Accordingly, our success depends on the acceptance among physicians and patients of the miraDry procedure as a preferred treatment for being sweat-bothered. Although we have received FDA clearance to market the miraDry procedure for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis, odor and permanent hair reduction in the United States and are approved or are otherwise free to market the miraDry procedure for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis in adults in over 40 international markets, the degree of market acceptance of the miraDry procedure by physicians and patients is unproven. We believe that market acceptance of the miraDry procedure will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe perceived advantages or disadvantages of the miraDry System compared to other products and procedures;\n\u2022\nthe safety and efficacy of the miraDry System relative to other products and alternative procedures;\n\u2022\nthe price of the miraDry System relative to other products and alternative procedures;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our marketing, advertising, and commercialization initiatives;\n\u2022\nthe development and publication of long-term clinical data in peer-reviewed journals supporting the long term efficacy of the miraDry procedure;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain regulatory clearance to market miraDry for additional treatment indications in the United States and other international markets;\n\u2022\neducation of physicians, especially general practitioners and dermatologists, regarding alternative procedures for sweat-bothered patients through key opinion leaders and product demonstrations at conferences, physician offices and webinars; and\n\u2022\nthe success of patient education through direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns that utilize social media outlets and testimonials.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has limited our ability to educate physicians and drive market acceptance of the miraDry procedure. We cannot guarantee that the miraDry procedure will achieve broad market acceptance among physicians and patients. We expect to derive a substantial portion of sales from the sale of our consumable bioTip products, which represent higher margin products within our product portfolio. As a result, any failure of this product to achieve meaningful market acceptance will harm our business, sales, profitability and future prospects.\nWe depend on a positive reaction from our Plastic Surgeons and their patients, and on an adequate supply of our products, to successfully establish our market position and achieve profitability.\nOur Breast Products segment has historically accounted for a substantial portion of our net sales and we expect our Breast Products to continue to be an increasingly significant portion of our net sales.\nWe depend on a continued positive reception from our Plastic Surgeon customers and their patients to be able to reestablish the market position we had prior to the voluntary suspension of our Breast Products manufactured by Silimed. Additionally, our re-entry into the market has required us to effectively and responsibly educate accounts on the results of our testing and reconfirm our strong clinical data, while providing the same high levels of customer service to which our Plastic Surgeons are accustomed. Our PSCs are working diligently to solidify the confidence and support of all our Plastic Surgeons; however, if we are not successful in re-establishing and maintaining these relationships or competing effectively in this market, our sales revenues, market share and financial performance will be affected negatively.\nAny inability to manage inventory supply issues, an inadequacy of current inventory levels, the potential loss of market acceptance of our Breast Products, or any adverse rulings by regulatory authorities, any adverse publicity or other adverse events relating to us or our Breast Products, or the introduction of competitive products by our competitors and other third parties, would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on sole suppliers to manufacture or supply the components for some of our products, including our breast products, scar management, tissue expander and bioTip products, and any production problems or inability to meet our demand could adversely affect our business prospects.\nWe rely on sole suppliers to manufacture certain of our products or the components used therein, including our silicone materials, our tissue expanders, Biocorneum and our bioTips, and the loss of any such supplier or any disruption in operations, production problems or inability to meet our supply demands of any such supplier could have a material adverse and severe effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, there can be no guarantees that we would be able to replace or transition to alternative suppliers on a timely basis or at all, if needed. If we are required to replace any of our sole suppliers, or transition to alternative suppliers, it may adversely impact our operations.\nFor example, we have entered into a definitive manufacturing agreement with NuSil Technology LLC (\u201cNuSil\u201d), who serves as the sole supplier of our silicone materials for short and long-term implantable products. If NuSil is unable to scale its manufacturing operations to meet our requirements in any future period, or if there are any delays or disruptions in manufacturing or delivering the implants, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated sales levels and our net sales and business prospects could suffer significantly. In addition, if NuSil were to terminate or otherwise fail to perform under the definitive manufacturing agreement, we would need to identify and qualify another alternate manufacturer, which would require a significant amount of time and resources and result in a supply interruption.\nThere are numerous risks in relying on sole suppliers to manufacture our products, which, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse and severe effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have limited manufacturing experience. We could experience manufacturing problems that result in our inability to satisfy customer demand or otherwise harm our business. Disruption in our manufacturing operations may prevent us from meeting customer demand, and our sales and profitability may suffer as a result.\nWe have limited manufacturing experience. With the Vesta Acquisition, we are now responsible for the manufacturing of our breast implants. We may be unable to produce sufficient quantities of our breast implants to meet customer demand. Any such failure would have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our manufacturing processes are regulated by the FDA and any failure to comply with our FDA-approved processes could result in significant delays which would adversely impact our business.\nFurther, a serious disruption, such as a tornado, flood or fire, to our manufacturing facility could damage our inventory levels and manufacturing operations and could materially impair our ability to distribute our breast implant products to customers in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost. We could also incur significantly higher costs and experience longer lead times during the time required to reopen or replace our primary distribution center or manufacturing facility. As a result, any serious disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDirect-to-consumer marketing and social media effort may expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny.\nOur efforts to promote our products via direct-to-consumer marketing and social media initiatives may subject us to additional scrutiny of our practices of effective communication of risk information, benefits or claims, under the oversight of the FDA, the Federal Telecommunications Commission, or FTC, or both.\nContracting with any third-party manufacturer and supplier involves inherent risks and various factors outside our direct control that may adversely affect the manufacturing and supply of our products.\nOur reliance on any third-party manufacturer, including NuSil, which supplies our silicone materials, Formulated Solutions, LLC, or Formulated Solutions, which supplies our BIOCORNEUM scar management products, SiMatrix, a Vesta subsidiary that supplies our tissue expanders, Healthcare Technology International which supplies bioTips for our miraDry System or any other third-party manufacturer we procure and qualify for the manufacture of our Breast Products or miraDry Products involves a number of risks. Changes that our manufacturers may make outside the purview of our direct control, or other mistakes and mishandling of our products, can have an impact on our processes and quality, as well as the successful delivery of our products. Additionally, if any third-party manufacturer becomes unable or unwilling to supply our products, we may not be able to find an alternate supplier in a timely manner. For example, there are only a few suppliers of medical-grade silicone available, and if these suppliers become unable or unwilling to supply medical-grade silicone to Formulated Solutions, SiMatrix or any other manufacturer that we may engage with, an alternate supply of medical-grade silicone may not be able to be found in a timely manner. Our existing manufacturing contracts will also expire, and there can be no assurance that our contracting counterparties will agree to continue to manufacture and supply our products or they may impose increased pricing terms if the contract is renegotiated or renewed.\nSome of the additional risks with relying on third-party manufacturers and suppliers include:\n\u2022\nour products may not be manufactured in accordance with agreed upon specifications or in compliance with regulatory requirements or cGMP, or the manufacturing facilities may not be able to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements or cGMP, which could negatively affect the safety or efficacy of our products or cause delays in shipments of our products;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to timely respond to unanticipated changes in customer orders, and if orders do not match forecasts, we may have excess or inadequate inventory of materials and components;\n\u2022\nour products may be mishandled while in production or in preparation for transit;\n\u2022\nwe are subject to transportation and import and export risk, particularly given the global nature of our supply chain;\n\u2022\nthe third-party manufacturer may discontinue manufacturing and supplying products to us for risk management reasons;\n\u2022\nthe third-party manufacturer may lose access to critical services and components, resulting in an interruption in the manufacturing or shipment of our products;\n\u2022\nthe third-party manufacturer may encounter financial or other hardships unrelated to us and our demand for products, which could inhibit our ability to fulfill our orders;\n\u2022\nthere may be delays in analytical results or failure of analytical techniques that we depend on for quality control and release of products;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, disease pandemics impacting the supply chain (such as the recent Coronavirus outbreak), labor disputes, financial distress, lack of raw material supply, issues with facilities and equipment or other forms of disruption to business operations affecting our manufacturer or its suppliers may occur;\n\u2022\nlatent defects may become apparent after products have been released and which may result in a recall of such products; and\n\u2022\nthere are inherent risks if we contract with manufacturers located outside of the United States, including the risks of economic change, recession, labor strikes or disruptions, political turmoil, new or changing tariffs or trade barriers, new or different restrictions on importing or exporting, civil unrest, infrastructure failure, cultural differences in doing business, lack of contract enforceability, lack of protection for intellectual property, war and terrorism.\nThe materialization of any of these risks and limitations inherent in a third-party manufacturing contractual relationship could significantly increase our costs, impair our ability to generate net sales, and adversely affect market acceptance of our products and customers may instead purchase or use our competitors\u2019 products, which could materially adversely and severely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to compete effectively against our competitors, some of which have significantly greater resources than we have, our net sales and operating results may be negatively affected.\nOur industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change from the introduction of new products, technologies and other activities of industry participants. For example, our Breast Products competitors, Mentor, a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, and Allergan, a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbvie, Inc., are well-capitalized global pharmaceutical companies that have been the market leaders for many years and have the majority share of the breast implant market in the United States. These competitors also enjoy several competitive advantages over us, including:\n\u2022\ngreater financial and human resources for sales, marketing and product development;\n\u2022\nestablished relationships with health care providers and third-party payors;\n\u2022\nestablished reputations and name recognition among health care providers and other key opinion leaders in the plastic surgery industry;\n\u2022\nin some cases, an established base of long-time customers;\n\u2022\ngreater financial resources and economies-of-scale to put additional pricing pressure on competing products;\n\u2022\nlarger and more established distribution networks;\n\u2022\ngreater ability to cross-sell products; and\n\u2022\nmore experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, performing clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval or clearance.\nIf we fail to compete effectively against our competitors, our net sales and operating results may be negatively affected.\nThe long-term safety of our Breast Products has not fully been established and our breast implants are currently under study in our Pre Market Approval, or PMA, post-approval studies, which could reveal unanticipated complications.\nWe have been marketing our silicone gel breast implants in the United States with pre-market approval from the FDA since 2012. However, there could still be unanticipated complications or unforeseen health consequences of being implanted with our silicone gel breast implants over the long-term (defined as 10 years or more). Additionally, we rely on our clinical data to make favorable comparisons of our product to our competitive products, and our longer-term data may change over time. Further, future studies or clinical experience may indicate that treatment with our products is not differentiated to treatment with competitive products. Such results could slow the adoption of our products and significantly reduce our sales, which could prevent us from achieving our forecasted sales targets or achieving or sustaining profitability. Moreover, if long-term results and experience indicate that our products cause unexpected or serious complications, we could be subject to required product labeling revisions, mandatory product recalls, suspension or withdrawal of clearance or approval by the FDA or other applicable regulatory bodies and significant legal liability.\nWe received a Warning Letter from FDA, dated March 19, 2019, relating to the Company\u2019s failure to meet the FDA-approved minimum retention rate for a post-approval study. We responded to this Warning Letter and are in continued dialogue with FDA to fully address our study\u2019s participant retention, including patient questionnaire completion and additional follow-up office visits.\nOn March 25-26, 2019, the FDA convened a meeting of the General and Plastic Surgery Devices Panel at the FDA\u2019s Headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, to discuss a range of topics concerning the benefit-risk profile of breast implants. In addition to a presentation of data and information about our products and those of other breast implant manufacturers, this two-day public meeting included presentations, recommendations, and discussion on breast implant associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL); systemic symptoms reported in patients receiving breast implants; the use of registries for breast implant surveillance; revision of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening recommendations for silent rupture of silicone gel filled breast implants; the use of surgical mesh in breast procedures such as breast reconstruction and mastopexy; the use of real-world data and patient perspectives in regulatory decision making; product labeling revisions; and recommendations for best practices (including a standardized checklist) for informed consent discussions between patients and clinicians.\nWe cannot predict future changes that may occur to the regulatory landscape regarding our products based on this Panel Meeting and subsequent developments regarding long-term data. For example, FDA issued final guidance in September 2020 informed by the Panel\u2019s recommendations to require a boxed warning and a standardized patient decision checklist as part of the informed consent process, along with other recommendations to update and provide additional labeling information.\nAmong the long-term health risks of breast implants which are being studied and followed, health regulators believe there is an association between breast implants and a rare form of lymphoma called Breast Implant Associated Anaplastic Large-Cell Lymphoma, or BIA-ALCL.\nIn January 2011, the FDA issued a Safety Communication indicating that there was a possible association between saline and silicone gel breast implants and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, or BIA-ALCL. Since our FDA approval in 2012, Sientra\u2019s breast-implant product labeling, which is approved by the FDA, has been required to contain a description of BIA-ALCL as a possible outcome. Since its report in January 2011, the FDA has continued to gather information about BIA-ALCL in women with breast implants through the review of medical device reports, review of medical literature, and collaboration with international regulators, scientific experts, ASPS, the Aesthetic Society, ISAPS, and other organizations.\nAs of August 23, 2017, the FDA updated its recommendations on BIA-ALCL and subsequently requested all breast implant manufacturers to revise their physician and patient labeling with the most up-to-date information. The FDA has continued to monitor these matters, and on February 6, 2019 issued a \u201cLetter to Health Care Providers\u201d and a public statement detailing updated medical device report (MDR) data involving BIA-ALCL, and stating that the data and published information reviewed to date suggest that patients with breast implants have an increased risk of BIA-ALCL. The FDA states: \u201cOver time, we have strengthened our understanding of this condition. In 2016, the World Health Organization designated breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) as a rare T-cell lymphoma that can develop following breast implants. The exact number of cases remains difficult to determine due to significant limitations in world-wide reporting and lack of global implant sales data. At this time, most data suggest that BIA-ALCL occurs more frequently following implantation of breast implants with textured surfaces rather than those with smooth surfaces.\u201d The FDA noted it does not recommend prophylactic breast implant removal in a patient without symptoms or other abnormality.\nOn March 25-26, 2019, the FDA convened a meeting of the General and Plastic Surgery Devices Panel which covered a range of topics concerning the benefit-risk profile of breast implants, including BIA-ALCL. On September 29, 2020, the FDA issued final guidance providing recommendations to breast implant manufacturers regarding the content and format of revised labeling information for saline and silicone gel-filled breast implants. The recommendations included a recommendation for a boxed warning that, among other things, states: \u201cBreast implants have been associated with the risk of developing BIA-ALCL and may be associated with systemic symptoms.\u201d\nFurther studies or clinical experience may indicate that breast implants, including our products, expose individuals to a more substantial risk of developing BIA-ALCL or other unexpected complications than currently anticipated. As a result, we may be exposed to increased regulatory scrutiny, negative publicity and lawsuits from any individual who may develop BIA-ALCL after using our products, any of which could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Moreover, if long-term results and clinical experience indicate that our products cause unexpected or serious complications, we could be subject to mandatory product recalls, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory clearances and approvals and significant legal liability.\nIn some instances in our advertising and promotion, we may make claims regarding our product as compared to competing products, which may subject us to heightened regulatory scrutiny, enforcement risk, and litigation risks.\nThe FDA applies a heightened level of scrutiny to comparative claims when applying its statutory standards for advertising and promotion, including with regard to its requirement that promotional labeling be truthful and not misleading. There is potential for differing interpretations of whether certain communications are consistent with a product\u2019s FDA-required labeling, and FDA will evaluate communications on a fact-specific basis.\nIn addition, making comparative claims may draw concerns from our competitors. Where a company makes a claim in advertising or promotion that its product is superior to the product of a competitor (or that the competitor\u2019s product is inferior), this creates a risk of a lawsuit by the competitor under federal and state false advertising or unfair and deceptive trade practices law, and possibly also state libel law. Such a suit may seek injunctive relief against further advertising, a court order directing corrective advertising, and compensatory and punitive damages where permitted by law.\nIf we are unable to train customers on the safe and appropriate use of our products, we may be unable to achieve our expected growth.\nAn important part of our sales process includes the ability to train Plastic Surgeons on the safe and appropriate use of our breast products. If we become unable to attract potential new Plastic Surgeon customers to our education and training programs, we may be unable to achieve our expected growth.\nThere is a learning process involved for Plastic Surgeons to become proficient in the use of our anatomically-shaped products. It is critical to the success of our commercialization efforts to train a sufficient number of Plastic Surgeons and provide them with adequate instruction in the appropriate use of our products via preceptorships and additional demonstration surgeries. This training process may take longer than expected and may therefore affect our ability to increase sales. Following completion of training, we rely on the trained Plastic Surgeons to advocate the benefits of our products in the marketplace. Convincing Plastic Surgeons to dedicate the time and energy necessary for adequate training is challenging, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in these efforts. If Plastic Surgeons are not properly trained, they may misuse or ineffectively use our products. This may also result in, among other things, unsatisfactory patient outcomes, patient injury, negative publicity or lawsuits against us, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nIf we are unable to continue to enhance our existing product offerings and develop and market new products that respond to customer needs and preferences and achieve market acceptance, we may experience a decrease in demand for our products and our business could suffer.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors, and ultimately satisfy the needs and preferences of our customers, unless we can continue to enhance existing products and develop and market new innovative products. Product development requires the investment of significant financial, technological and other resources. Product improvements and new product introductions also require significant planning, design, development and testing at the technological, product and manufacturing process levels and may involve additional clinical trials and we may not be able to timely develop product improvements or new products. Our competitors\u2019 new products may beat our products to market, be more effective with new features, obtain better market acceptance or render our products obsolete. Any new or modified products that we develop may not receive clearance or approval from the FDA, or achieve market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on, among other things, existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising, marketing, promotional programs and research and development.\nLaws impacting the U.S. healthcare system are subject to a great deal of uncertainty, which may result in adverse consequences to our business.\nThere have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system, reduce the costs of healthcare and change medical reimbursement policies. Doctors, clinics, hospitals and other users of our products may decline to purchase our products to the extent there is uncertainty regarding coverage from government or commercial payors. Further proposed legislation, regulation and policy changes affecting third-party reimbursement are likely.\nThere have been various efforts to repeal or materially modify various aspects of the Affordable Care Act, or ACA. The results and effects of such ongoing efforts have varied after facing judicial and Congressional challenges, but could affect our business operations and prospects in unknown ways, and it is unclear how ACA and other laws ultimately will be implemented.\nOn December 15, 2019, a federal district court in Texas struck down the ACA in its entirety, finding that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the TCJA, rendered the individual mandate unconstitutional. On December 14, 2018, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas struck down the ACA, deeming it unconstitutional given that Congress repealed the individual mandate in 2017; on July 9, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit heard arguments on appeal in this matter (formerly Texas v. Azar, now California v. Texas). On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit ruled that the ACA's individual mandate is unconstitutional given that the TCJA eliminated the tax penalty associated with the individual mandate. In concluding that the individual mandate is unconstitutional, the question remains whether, or how much of, the rest of the ACA is severable from that constitutional defect. The Fifth Circuit further remanded the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas to further analyze whether the other provisions of the ACA are severable as they currently exist under the law. It is unclear how the eventual decision from this appeal, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and Following appeal of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in California v. Texas on November 2, 2020.\nIt is unclear how the eventual decisions from the Supreme Court and the various other courts across the country to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. It is also unclear how regulations and sub-regulatory policy, which fluctuate continually, may affect interpretation and implementation of the ACA and its practical effects on our business, particularly entering an election year. We cannot predict whether future healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level or internationally, or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us. Such legislation and regulation of healthcare costs may, however, result in decreased lower reimbursements by governmental and private payors to our customers, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Financial arrangements and incentives that may impact healthcare decision-making continue to be a subject of attention for Congress and health regulators, with examples in recent years including efforts to impose additional oversight on certain types of facilities even when only commercial or cash-pay services are involved.\nIf changes in the economy and consumer spending reduce consumer demand for our products, our sales and profitability would suffer.\nWe are subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in general economic and market conditions, pandemics or political actions including new or increased trade protection policies such as tariffs, particularly in China, where certain components of our miraDry products are manufactured. Certain elective procedures, such as breast augmentation and the miraDry procedure, are typically not covered by insurance. Adverse changes in the economy or a \u201ctrade war\u201d may cause consumers to reassess their spending choices and reduce the demand for these surgeries and other procedures and could have an adverse effect on consumer spending. This shift could have an adverse effect on our net sales and profitability. Furthermore, consumer preferences and trends may shift due to a variety of factors, including changes in demographic and social trends, public health initiatives and product innovations, which may reduce consumer demand for our products. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, our bioTip manufacturer in China was required to close for a week. In addition, as the outbreak spread through the United States and globally, we have experienced a significant reduction in demand as non-emergency medical procedures are deferred. There can be no assurances that once healthcare systems resume normal activity that these deferred procedures will be rescheduled. The outbreak has adversely affected our financial condition and results of operations and will likely continue to adversely impact our operations until heathcare systems resume normal activity. At this point, the duration and extent of such impact is uncertain.\nAny negative publicity concerning our products could harm our business and reputation and negatively impact our financial results.\nThe responses of potential patients, physicians, the news media, legislative and regulatory bodies and others to information about complications or alleged complications of our products could result in negative publicity and could materially reduce market acceptance of our products. These responses or any investigations and potential resulting negative publicity may have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations or the market price of our common stock. In addition, significant negative publicity could result in an increased number of product liability claims against us.\nProduct liability and warranty claims or other litigation and related negative publicity may adversely affect our business, sales, financial condition and operating results.\nAs a supplier of medical devices, we are and may be subject to product liability or warranty claims alleging that the use of our products has resulted in adverse health effects or other litigation in the ordinary course of business that may require us to make significant expenditures to defend these claims or pay damage awards. The breast implant industry has a particularly significant history of product liability litigation. The risks of litigation exist even with respect to products that have received or in the future may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale, such as our Breast Products. For example, on October 7, 2019, a lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California against us and Silimed Industria de Implantes Ltda. (our former contract manufacturer). The lawsuit alleges that our textured breast implants caused certain of the plaintiffs to develop a condition known as breast implant associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (\u201cBIA-ALCL\u201d), and that we are liable to the Plaintiffs based on claims for strict liability (failure to warn), strict liability (defective manufacture), negligence and loss of consortium. On September 20, 2020, a lawsuit was filed against the Company in the Eastern District of Tennessee alleging that our textured breast implants caused certain of the plaintiffs to develop BIA-ALCL, and that we are liable to the\nplaintiffs based on claims for strict liability (failure to warn), strict liability (defective manufacture), negligence and loss of consortium. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these lawsuits. Given the recent publicity surrounding BIA-ALCL and the FDA guidance for a \u201cboxed warning\u201d on labeling materials for breast implants, we may face additional litigation and negative publicity surrounding our breast implants in the future. An increase in product liability claims and the related negative publicity could significantly harm our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, historically our silicone gel breast implants were sold with a warranty providing for no-charge replacement implants in the event of certain ruptures that occur any time during the life of the patient and this warranty also includes cash payments to offset surgical fees if the rupture occurs within ten years of implantation. In April 2018, we announced our Platinum20 product replacement and limited warranty program, which we believe provides an industry-leading program of no-charge replacement implants for covered rupture events that occur during the lifetime of the patient, and no-charge replacement implants for other covered events that occur within twenty years of the implant procedure, as well as financial assistance for certain qualifying events that occur within twenty years of the implant procedure. If we experience an increase in warranty claims following the launch of our Platinum20 warranty in excess of our expectations, or if our replacement costs associated with warranty claims increase significantly, we will incur liabilities for potential warranty claims that may be greater than we expect. An increase in the frequency of warranty claims or amount of warranty costs may harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe maintain product liability insurance, but this insurance is limited in amount and subject to significant deductibles. There is no guarantee that insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all claims. Our insurance policies are subject to annual renewal and we may not be able to obtain liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, our insurance premiums could be subject to increases in the future, or could be subject to exclusions or limitations, which may be material. If the coverage limits are inadequate to cover our liabilities or our insurance costs continue to increase as a result of warranty or product liability claims or other litigation, then our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe are required to maintain high levels of inventory, which could consume a significant amount of our resources and reduce our cash flows.\nWe need to maintain substantial levels of inventory to protect ourselves from supply interruptions, provide our customers with a wide range of shapes and sizes of our breast implants, and account for the high return rates we experience as Plastic Surgeons typically order our products in multiple sizes for a single surgery and then return what they do not use. As a result of the substantial inventory levels we like to maintain, we are subject to the risk that a substantial portion of our inventory becomes obsolete. The materialization of any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows due to the resulting costs associated with the inventory impairment charges and costs required to replace such inventory. Additionally, our ability to find an alternate supplier in a timely manner, may affect our ability to maintain the level of inventory supply we require to protect ourselves from supply interruptions that could have an unfavorable impact on our net sales.\nAny disruption at our facilities could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur principal offices are located in Santa Barbara, California. Substantially all of our operations are conducted at this location, including customer service, development and management and administrative functions. Substantially all of our inventory of Breast Products is held at a second location in Santa Barbara, California, and, with the Vesta Acquisition, we manufacture our breast implants at a third location in Wisconsin. Despite our efforts to safeguard our facilities, including acquiring insurance, adopting health and safety protocols and utilizing off-site storage of computer data, vandalism, terrorism, public health crisis (such as the recent COVID-19 outbreak) or a natural or other disaster, such as an earthquake, tornado, fire or flood, could damage or destroy our inventory of finished goods, cause substantial delays in our operations, result in the loss of key information and cause us to incur additional expenses. Our insurance may not cover our losses in any particular case. In addition, regardless of the level of insurance coverage, damage to our facilities may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nCyberattacks and other security breaches could compromise our proprietary information which could harm our business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we generate, collect and store proprietary information, including intellectual property and business information. The secure storage, maintenance, and transmission of and access to this information is critical to our operations, business strategy, and reputation. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our computer systems or our third party IT service providers' systems and, if successful, misappropriate our proprietary information. In addition, an employee, contractor, or other third-party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information, and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. While we will continue to implement additional protective measures to reduce the risk of and detect cyberattacks, these incidents are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and the techniques used in such attacks evolve rapidly and are difficult to detect. Despite our cybersecurity measures, our information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to unpermitted access by hackers or other breaches, or employee error or malfeasance. Any such compromise of our, or our third party IT service providers' data security and access to, or public disclosure or loss of, confidential business or proprietary intellectual property information could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, provide our competitors with valuable information, and subject us to additional costs which could adversely affect our business.\nIf there are significant disruptions in our information technology systems, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage sales and marketing data, accounting and financial functions, inventory, product development tasks, clinical data, and customer service and technical support functions. Our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, floods and other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, computer viruses or hackers, power losses, and computer system or data network failures. In addition, a variety of our software systems are cloud-based data management applications hosted by third-party service providers whose security and information technology systems are subject to similar risks.\nThe failure of our or our service providers\u2019 information technology could disrupt our entire operation or result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs and product shortages, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may be adversely affected by natural disasters or public health crises and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nOur corporate headquarters and certain other facilities are located in Santa Barbara, California, which in the past has experienced both severe earthquakes, wildfires, tornados, and mudslides. Earthquakes, wildfires, other natural disasters, or public health crises (such as the COVID-19 outbreak) could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIf a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters or manufacturing facilities, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as our enterprise financial systems or manufacturing resource planning and enterprise quality systems, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to obtain hospital or group purchasing organization contracts could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nA portion of our net sales is derived from sales to hospitals. Many hospital customers, through the contracting process, limit the number of breast implant suppliers that may sell to their institution. Hospitals may choose to contract with our competitors who have a broader range of products that can be used in a wider variety of procedures or our competitors may actively position their broader product portfolios against us during the hospital contracting process. Any limitations on the number of hospitals to which we can sell our products may significantly restrict our ability to grow.\nIn addition, contracts with hospitals and group purchasing organizations, or GPOs, often have complex insurance and indemnification requirements, which may not be beneficial to us, or we may not be able to successfully negotiate contracts with a substantial number of hospitals and GPOs at all, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could suffer if we lose the services of key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel.\nWe are dependent upon the continued services of key personnel, including members of our executive management team who have extensive experience in our industry. The loss of any one of these individuals could disrupt our operations or our strategic plans. Additionally, our future success will depend on, among other things, our ability to continue to hire and retain the necessary qualified sales, marketing and managerial personnel, for whom we compete with numerous other companies, academic institutions and organizations. If we lose key employees, if we are unable to attract or retain other qualified personnel, or if our management team is not able to effectively manage us through these events, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to political, economic and regulatory risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\nAs a result of our acquisition of miraDry, we face risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to international operations. We are able to market and sell the miraDry System in over 40 international markets outside of North America, including countries in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and South America. In addition, we may seek to market and sell the miraDry System in additional countries, as well as seek approval to market and sell our breast products in international markets, in the future. These laws, regulations, policies and standards are complex, and there is a risk that some provisions may be breached by us, for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements, or otherwise. Compliance with existing laws, regulations, policies and standards, the adoption of new laws, regulations, policies or standards, changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, policies or standards, changes in the regulation of our activities by a government or standards body and/or rulings in court, regulatory, administrative or other proceedings relating to such laws, regulations, policies or standards, including, among others, those affecting manufacturing practices, competitive business practices, the use of our products, protection of intellectual property, trade and trade protection, including tariffs, foreign currency, investments or loans, taxation, export control, privacy and data protection, environmental protection, health and safety, labor and employment, human rights, corporate governance, public disclosure or business conduct could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nViolations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, requirements to obtain export licenses, implementation of compliance programs, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results.\nInternational trade disputes could result in tariffs and other protectionist measures that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Tariffs could increase the cost of the Company\u2019s products and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs could adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs could also make the Company\u2019s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company\u2019s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other protectionist measures that could limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer its products and services. Political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and protectionist measures could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nIn addition to the foregoing, engaging in international business inherently involves a number of other difficulties and risks, including:\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability or sanctions in areas in which we operate;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs, customs charges, bureaucratic requirements and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nregulations related to customs and import/export matters;\n\u2022\ntax issues, including tax law changes and compliance with other tax laws;\n\u2022\ncompliance with complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions resulting from our intercompany arrangements, if any;\n\u2022\ncomplying with laws, rules and regulations relating to the manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of products in the jurisdictions in which we do or will operate;\n\u2022\noperating under regulations in jurisdictions related to obtaining eligibility for government or private payor reimbursement for our products at the wholesale/retail level;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations, including cultural and language differences and additional employment regulations, union workforce negotiations and potential disputes in the jurisdictions in which we operate;\n\u2022\ndifficulties associated with compliance with a variety of laws and regulations governing international trade, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022\ndifficulties protecting or procuring intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThese factors or any combination of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Results\nOur debt obligations could impair our financial condition and limit our operating flexibility.\nOur indebtedness under our credit agreements with MidCap Financial Trust, or the Credit Agreements, our Convertible Note with Deerfield and our other financial obligations could:\n\u2022\nimpair our ability to obtain financing or additional debt in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nimpair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us;\n\u2022\nhave a material adverse effect on us if we fail to comply with financial and affirmative and restrictive covenants in our Credit Agreements and an event of default occurs as a result of a failure that is not cured or waived;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow for interest payments on our indebtedness and other financial obligations, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital and capital expenditures; and\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate.\nOur financial covenants in the Credit Agreements require us to achieve certain levels of net revenue calculated on a rolling monthly basis. Due to the continued uncertainty relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenues may continue to be adversely impacted. If we are unable to achieve certain revenue targets, we may breach certain financial covenants set forth in our Credit Agreements. If we breach these covenants, MidCap will have the right to accelerate repayment of the outstanding amounts. In addition, a breach of a financial covenant in the Credit Agreement would result in a cross default under our Convertible Note with Deerfield, which would allow Deerfield to accelerate repayment of the amounts owed, subject to certain restrictions. In the event that any of MidCap or Deerfield accelerates the repayment of our indebtedness, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash on hand to satisfy such obligations and our business operations may be materially harmed.\nFurthermore, there is no guarantee that we will be able to pay the principal and interest under the Credit Agreements or the Convertible Note or that future working capital, borrowings or equity financing will be available to repay or refinance any amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreements or Convertible Note. Our obligations under the Credit Agreements are secured by a perfected security interest in all of our tangible and intangible assets (including our intellectual property assets), except for certain customary excluded property and all of our and our subsidiaries capital stock, with certain limited exceptions. In addition, we may enter into debt agreements in the future that may contain similar or more burdensome terms and covenants, including financial covenants.\nWe accepted a loan under the CARES Act pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program, or the PPP, which loan may not be forgiven or may subject us to challenges and investigations regarding qualification for the loan. In addition, we may be subject to audit in connection with the loan and should we request that the loan be forgiven, the United States Small Business Administration, or SBA, will conduct a full audit in connection with the loan. If there is any adverse finding from the audit or if we are subject to any other investigation or challenge in connection with the loan, we could be required to return the full amount of the PPP loan plus interest, which could reduce our liquidity, and could be subject to significant fines, damages and penalties and our business could otherwise be adversely affected, whether or not there is an adverse finding. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn April 2020, we were granted a loan of $6.7 million under the PPP of the CARES Act, or the PPP Loan, all or a portion of which may be forgiven dependent on our use of proceeds. The PPP Loan matures on April 20, 2022 and bears interest at a rate of 1.0% per annum. All or a portion of the PPP Loan may be forgiven by the SBA upon submission of documentation of expenditures in accordance with the SBA\u2019s requirements. Under the CARES Act, loan forgiveness is available for the sum of documented payroll costs, covered rent payments, covered mortgage interest and covered utilities during the 24-week period beginning on the date of loan approval. Not more than 40% of the forgiven amount may be for non-payroll costs. The amount of the PPP Loan eligible to be forgiven will be reduced if our full-time headcount declines, or if salaries and wages for employees with salaries of $100,000 or less annually are reduced by more than 25%. We will be required to repay any portion of the outstanding principal that is not forgiven, along with accrued interest, in accordance with the amortization schedule described above, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be eligible for loan forgiveness, that we will ultimately apply for forgiveness, or that any amount of the PPP Loan will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA. Furthermore, on April 28, 2020, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury stated that the SBA will perform a full review of any PPP loan over $2.0 million before forgiving the loan.\nThe PPP Loan application required us to certify, among other things, that the current economic uncertainty made the PPP Loan request necessary to support our ongoing operations. While we made this certification in good faith after analyzing, among other things, our financial situation and access to alternative forms of capital, and believe that we satisfied all eligibility criteria for the PPP Loan and that our receipt of the PPP Loan is consistent with the broad objectives of the PPP of the CARES Act, the certification described above does not contain any objective criteria and is subject to interpretation. In addition, the SBA has stated that it is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith. The lack of clarity regarding loan eligibility under the Paycheck Protection Program has resulted in significant media coverage and controversy with respect to public companies applying for and receiving loans. If, despite our good faith belief that we satisfied all eligibility requirements for the PPP Loan, we are found to have been ineligible to receive the PPP Loan or in violation of any of the laws or governmental regulations that apply to us in connection with the PPP Loan, including the False Claims Act, we may be subject to penalties, including significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties and could be required to repay the PPP Loan. In the event that we seek forgiveness of all or a portion of the PPP Loan, we will also be required to make certain certifications which will be subject to audit and review by governmental entities and could subject us to significant penalties and liabilities if found to be inaccurate, including under the False Claims Act. In addition, our receipt of the PPP Loan may result in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation, and a review or audit by the SBA or other government entity or claims under the False Claims Act could consume significant financial and management resources. Any of these events could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur quarterly net sales and operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to factors outside our control, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.\nOur net sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate. Our net sales and results of operations will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to integrate and achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions of the Vesta manufacturing operations, miraDry, BIOCORNEUM and our tissue expander portfolio;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the buying patterns of patients and seasonal cycles in consumer spending;\n\u2022\nour ability to drive increased sales of Breast Products, miraDry Systems and bioTips;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain an effective and dedicated sales organization;\n\u2022\npricing pressure applicable to our products, including adverse third-party coverage and reimbursement outcomes;\n\u2022\nresults of clinical research and trials on our existing products;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the past regulatory inquiries of Silimed on our brand and reputation;\n\u2022\ntiming of our research and development activities and initiatives;\n\u2022\nthe mix of our products sold due to different profit margins among our products and sales channels;\n\u2022\ntiming of new product offerings, acquisitions, licenses or other significant events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our suppliers to timely provide us with an adequate supply of products;\n\u2022\nthe evolving product offerings of our competitors;\n\u2022\nregulatory approvals and legislative changes affecting the products we may offer or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nincreased labor and related costs;\n\u2022\ninterruption in the manufacturing or distribution of our products;\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological, industry and market developments;\n\u2022\nchanges in our ability to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for our products; and\n\u2022\nour ability to expand the geographic reach of our sales and marketing efforts.\nMany of the products we may seek to develop and introduce in the future will require FDA approval or clearance before commercialization in the United States, and commercialization of such products outside of the United States would likely require additional regulatory approvals, CE Certificates of Conformity and export licenses. As a result, it will be difficult for us to forecast demand for these products with any degree of certainty. In addition, we will be increasing our operating expenses as we expand our commercial capabilities. Accordingly, we may experience significant, unanticipated quarterly losses. If our quarterly or annual operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly or annual fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nOur ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of approximately $445 million available to reduce future taxable income, which begin expiring in 2027, if not utilized to offset taxable income. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u201c5% shareholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Our existing NOLs may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and if we undergo one or more ownership changes in connection with future transactions in our stock, our ability to utilize NOLs could be further limited by Section 382 of the Code. In addition, the deduction for NOLs generated after 2017 is limited to 80% of our taxable income. As a result of these limitations, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the NOLs reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. Our deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards have been offset by a full valuation allowance in our financial statements.\nIf the goodwill we have recorded in connection with acquisitions becomes impaired, our earnings and capital could be reduced.\nIn accordance with GAAP, we record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value with the excess of the purchase consideration over the net assets acquired resulting in the recognition of goodwill. As a result, acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill. We perform a goodwill evaluation at least annually to test for goodwill impairment. As part of our testing, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we determine the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount using these qualitative factors, we then compare the fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount to measure any impairment loss. Adverse changes in our business, including a deviation from our expected growth rate and performance, a significant decline in future operating cash flows, or a significant change in our stock price or market capitalization may significantly affect the fair value of our goodwill and may trigger additional impairment losses, which could be materially adverse to our operating results and financial position. For example, as previously disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending June 30, 2019, we recorded an impairment to goodwill relating to our miraDry acquisition.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future. Any impairment charge would have an adverse effect on our results of stockholders\u2019 equity and financial results and could cause a decline in our stock price.\nFuture changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected net sales or expense fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.\nA change in accounting standards could have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New pronouncements and varying interpretations of existing pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results of our business.\nOur results of operations and financial position could be negatively impacted if there are adverse changes in tax laws and regulations.\nWe could be adversely affected in the future by changes in applicable tax laws, regulations, or administrative interpretations thereof. On December 22, 2017, then President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which provides for significant changes in the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act contains provisions with separate effective dates but is generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. This change to the U.S. tax system, as well as a change to the tax system in a jurisdiction where we have significant operations, or a change in tax law in other jurisdictions where we do business, could have a material and adverse effect on our business and on the results of our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property and Potential Litigation\nIf our intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our products or technologies, others could compete against us more directly, which would hurt our profitability.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of trademarks, trade secrets, confidential information, copyrights, patent rights and other intellectual property rights to protect our intellectual property. In addition, to protect our trade secrets, confidential information and other intellectual property rights, we have entered into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and confidential information and invention assignment agreements with employees, consultants and advisors. However, these agreements may not provide sufficient protection or adequate remedies for violation of our rights in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential and proprietary information. Without additional protection under the patent or other intellectual property laws, such unauthorized use or disclosure may enable competitors to duplicate or surpass our technological achievements. Moreover, the laws of certain foreign countries do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Failure to protect our proprietary rights could seriously impair our competitive position.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by patent and other intellectual property litigation and we have and could become subject to litigation that could be costly, result in the diversion of management\u2019s time and efforts, require us to pay damages or prevent us from marketing our existing or future products.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on not infringing the patents or violating the other proprietary rights of others. Significant litigation regarding patent rights occurs in our industry. Our competitors in both the United States and abroad, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in patent portfolios and competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use and sell our products. Absent specific circumstances, we do not generally conduct independent reviews of patents issued to third parties. We may not be aware of whether our products do or will infringe existing or future patents. In addition, patent applications in the United States and elsewhere can be pending for many years, and may be confidential for 18 months or more after filing, and because pending patent claims can be revised before issuance, there may be applications of others now pending of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products. We may not be aware of patents that have already been issued that a third party might assert are infringed by our products. It is also possible that patents of which we are aware, but which we do not believe are relevant to our product candidates, could nevertheless be found to be infringed by our products. The large number of patents, the rapid rate of new patent applications and issuances, the complexities of the technology involved and the uncertainty of litigation increase the risk of business assets and management\u2019s attention being diverted to patent litigation. In the future, we may receive communications\nfrom various industry participants alleging our infringement of their patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights and/or offering licenses to such intellectual property. Any lawsuits resulting from such allegations could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidate our proprietary rights, even if they lack merit. Any existing or potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nstop making, selling or using products or technologies that allegedly infringe the asserted intellectual property;\n\u2022\nlose the opportunity to license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our intellectual property rights against others;\n\u2022\nincur significant legal expenses;\n\u2022\npay substantial damages or royalties to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing;\n\u2022\npay the attorney fees and costs of litigation to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing;\n\u2022\nredesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property, which could be costly, disruptive and/or infeasible; or\n\u2022\nattempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property from third parties, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nAny litigation or claim against us, even those without merit, may cause us to incur substantial costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our core business, negatively impact shareholder value and harm our reputation. If we are found to infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, we could be required to pay substantial damages (which may be increased up to three times of awarded damages) and/or substantial royalties and could be prevented from selling our products unless we obtain a license or are able to redesign our products to avoid infringement. Any such license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to redesign our products in a way that would not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. If we fail to obtain any required licenses or make any necessary changes to our products or technologies, we may have to withdraw existing products from the market or may be unable to commercialize one or more of our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we generally indemnify our customers with respect to infringement by our products of the proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers. These claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers, regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use. If we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our customers may be forced to stop using our products.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our competitors or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at other medical device companies, including our competitors or potential competitors, in some cases until recently. We have been the subject of and may, in the future, be subject to claims that we, or our employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of these former employers or competitors. In addition, we have been and may in the future be subject to claims that we caused an employee to breach the terms of his or her non-competition or non-solicitation agreement. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and could be a distraction to management. If our defense to those claims fails, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Any litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire employees.\nA loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize product candidates, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFluctuations in insurance cost and availability of insurance coverage could adversely affect our profitability or our risk management profile.\nWe hold a number of insurance policies, including product liability insurance, directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, general liability insurance, property insurance, employment practices, cyber, and workers\u2019 compensation insurance. If the costs of maintaining adequate insurance coverage increase significantly in the future, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. Likewise, if any of our current insurance coverage should become unavailable to us or become economically impractical, we would be required to operate our business without indemnity from commercial insurance providers. If we operate our business without insurance, we could be responsible for paying claims or judgments against us that would have otherwise been covered by insurance, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nOur medical device products and operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation both in the United States and abroad, and our failure to comply with applicable requirements could cause our business to suffer.\nOur medical device products and operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and various other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities, such as Health Canada. Government regulation of medical devices is meant to assure their safety and effectiveness, and includes regulation of, among other things:\n\u2022\ndesign, development and manufacturing;\n\u2022\ntesting, labeling, content and language of instructions for use and storage;\n\u2022\nclinical trials;\n\u2022\nproduct safety;\n\u2022\nmarketing, sales and distribution;\n\u2022\nregulatory clearances and approvals including pre-market clearance and approval;\n\u2022\nconformity assessment procedures;\n\u2022\nproduct traceability and record keeping procedures;\n\u2022\nadvertising and promotion;\n\u2022\nproduct complaints, complaint reporting, recalls and field safety corrective actions;\n\u2022\npost-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury;\n\u2022\npost-market studies; and\n\u2022\nproduct import and export.\nThe regulations to which we are subject are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Regulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations, higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales.\nBefore we can market or sell a new regulated product or a significant modification to an existing product in the United States, we must obtain either clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, or an approval of a PMA application unless the device is specifically exempt from pre-market review. In the 510(k) clearance process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to a device legally on the market, known as a \u201cpredicate\u201d device, with respect to intended use, technology and safety and effectiveness, in order to clear the proposed device for marketing. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. In the PMA approval process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is safe and effective for its intended use based, in part, on specific data, including, but not limited to, pre-clinical, clinical trial, and other product data. The PMA process is typically required for devices for which the 510(k) process cannot be used and that are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices. Modifications to products that are approved through a PMA application generally need FDA approval. Similarly, some modifications made to products cleared through a 510(k) may require a new 510(k). The FDA\u2019s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to 12 months, but may last longer. The process of obtaining a PMA is much more costly and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process and generally takes from one to three years, or even longer, from the time the application is submitted to the FDA until an approval is obtained.\nIn the United States, our silicone gel breast implants are marketed pursuant to a PMA order issued by the FDA in March 2012, and our tissue expanders are marketed pursuant to premarket clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. If the FDA requires us to go through a lengthier, more rigorous examination for future products or modifications to existing products than we had expected, our product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled, which could cause our sales to decline. The FDA may demand that we obtain a PMA prior to marketing certain of our future products. In addition, if the FDA disagrees with our determination that a product we market is subject to an exemption from pre-market review, the FDA may require us to submit a 510(k) or PMA in order to continue marketing the product. Further, even with respect to those future products where a PMA is not required, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the 510(k) clearances with respect to those products.\nThe FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a device for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction that our products are safe and effective for their intended uses;\n\u2022\nthe data from our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval, where required; and\n\u2022\nthe manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements.\nIn addition, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions that may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently approved or cleared products on a timely basis. Any change in the laws or regulations that govern the clearance and approval processes relating to our current and future products could make it more difficult and costly to obtain clearance or approval for new products, or to produce, market and distribute existing products.\nThe FDA could also reclassify some or all of our products that are currently classified as Class II to Class III requiring additional controls, clinical studies and submission of a PMA for us to continue marketing and selling those products. We cannot guarantee that the FDA will not reclassify any of our Class II devices into Class III and require us to submit a PMA for FDA review and approval of the safety and effectiveness of our product. Any delay in, or failure to receive or maintain clearance or approval for our products under development could prevent us from generating sales from these products or achieving profitability. Additionally, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers. Regulatory enforcement or inquiries, or other increased scrutiny on us, could dissuade some surgeons from using our products and adversely affect our reputation and the perceived safety and effectiveness of our products.\nMoreover, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive compensation in connection with such services. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to report some of these relationships to the FDA or other regulatory authority. The FDA or other regulatory authority may conclude that a financial relationship between us and a principal investigator has created a conflict of interest or otherwise affected interpretation or reliability of the study data. The FDA or other regulatory authority may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, or rejection, of our marketing applications by the FDA or other regulatory authority, as the case may be, and may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of one or more of our product candidates.\nIn addition, even after we have obtained the proper regulatory clearance or approval to market a product, the FDA has the power to require us to conduct post-marketing studies. For example, we are required to continue to study and report clinical results to the FDA on our silicone gel breast implants. We completed and submitted the Final Report to FDA for our 10-year pivotal study in March 2018. Clinical data is ongoing for our second or \u201cnew enrollment\u201d post-approval study. Failure to conduct required studies in a timely manner or otherwise in accordance with requirements imposed by the FDA could result in the revocation of the PMA approval or 510(k) clearance for the product that is subject to such a requirement and could also result in the recall or withdrawal of the product, which would prevent us from generating sales from that product in the United States.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could jeopardize our ability to sell our products and result in enforcement actions such as:\n\u2022\nwarning letters;\n\u2022\nfines;\n\u2022\ninjunctions;\n\u2022\ncivil penalties;\n\u2022\ntermination of distribution;\n\u2022\nrecalls or seizures of products;\n\u2022\ndelays in the introduction of products into the market;\n\u2022\ntotal or partial suspension of production;\n\u2022\nrefusal of the FDA or other regulator to grant future clearances or approvals;\n\u2022\nwithdrawals or suspensions of current clearances or approvals, resulting in prohibitions on sales of our products; and/or\n\u2022\nin the most serious cases, criminal penalties.\nAny of these sanctions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we or if our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s, FDA\u2019s, good manufacturing practice regulations, it could impair our ability to market our products in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nWe and our third-party manufacturers are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s QSR, which covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of our products. The FDA audits compliance with the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing and other facilities. The FDA may conduct inspections or audits at any time. If we or our manufacturers fail to adhere to QSR requirements, have significant non-compliance issues or fail to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues, or if any corrective action plan that we or our manufacturers propose in response to observed deficiencies is not sufficient, the FDA could take enforcement action against us, which could delay production of our products and may include:\n\u2022\nuntitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u2022\nunanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;\n\u2022\ncustomer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our products;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022\nrefusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products or modified products;\n\u2022\nwithdrawing 510(k) clearances or pre-market approvals that have already been granted;\n\u2022\nrefusal to grant export approval for our products; or\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution.\nAny of the foregoing actions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, our manufacturers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, which could result in our failure to produce our products on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all.\nOur ability to market the miraDry System is limited to the treatment of sweat, odor and hair in the underarm in the United States and sweat in the underarm only internationally, and if we want to expand our marketing claims, we will need to obtain additional regulatory clearances or approvals, which may not be granted.\nWe currently only have FDA clearance to market the miraDry System in the United States for the treatment of primary hyperhidrosis of the axilla, or the underarm, and for permanent hair reduction procedures in the axilla and clearance to market internationally is limited to sweat only. This clearance restricts our ability to market or advertise the miraDry System for other specific body areas, and other conditions, which could limit physician adoption and patient demand for the miraDry System. We believe that future applications using the miraDry System could be used to treat other body areas, such as the feet and hands, where patients experience sweat-bothered symptoms. In addition, we will be required to conduct additional clinical trials or studies to support our applications, which may be time-consuming and expensive, and may produce results that do not result in submission of, or applicable regulatory clearances for, new treatment applications. In the event that we do not obtain additional regulatory clearances, our ability to promote the miraDry System in the United States and internationally will be limited. Ongoing restrictions on our ability to market the miraDry System in the United States and internationally for other indications or body areas could harm our business and limit our net sales growth.\nThere is no guarantee that the FDA will grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of our future products, and failure to obtain necessary clearances or approvals for our future products would adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nSome of our future products may require FDA clearance of a 510(k) or FDA approval of a PMA. The FDA may not approve or clear these products for the indications that are necessary or desirable for successful commercialization. Indeed, the FDA may refuse our requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products.\nSignificant delays in receiving clearance or approval, or the failure to receive clearance or approval for our new products would have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business.\nIf we modify our FDA approved or cleared devices or manufacturing processes, we may need to seek additional clearances or approvals, which, if not granted, would prevent us from selling our modified products.\nIn the United States, our silicone gel breast implants are marketed pursuant to a PMA order issued by the FDA in March 2012, and our tissue expanders and miraDry System are marketed pursuant to pre-market clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. Any modifications to a PMA-approved or 510(k)-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, including significant design and manufacturing changes, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, manufacture, design, components, or technology requires a new 510(k) clearance or, possibly, approval of a new PMA application or PMA supplement. For example, on March 14, 2017, we announced that we had submitted a PMA supplement to the FDA for the manufacturing of our PMA-approved breast implants by Vesta for which we received final approval on April 17, 2018. Certain changes to a PMA-approved device do not require submission and approval of a new PMA or PMA supplement and may only require notice to FDA in a PMA 30-Day Notice, Special PMA Supplement - Changes Being Effected or PMA Annual Report. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA may review any manufacturer\u2019s decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary. We have modified some of our 510(k) cleared products, and have determined based on our review of the applicable FDA guidance that in certain instances the changes did not require new 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals. If the FDA disagrees with our determination and requires us to seek new 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals for modifications to our previously cleared or approved products for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. Furthermore, our products could be subject to recall if the FDA determines, for any reason, that our products are not safe or effective or that appropriate regulatory submissions were not made. Delays in receipt or failure to receive approvals, the loss of previously received approvals, or the failure to comply with any other existing or future regulatory requirements, could reduce our sales, profitability and future growth prospects.\nA recall of our products, either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA or another governmental authority, or the discovery of serious safety issues with our products that leads to corrective actions, could have a significant adverse impact on us.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture of a product or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. The FDA\u2019s authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is reasonable probability that the device would cause serious injury or death. Manufacturers may also, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found or withdraw a product to improve device performance or for other reasons. The FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the FDA within 10 working days after the recall is initiated. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Similar regulatory agencies in other countries have similar authority to recall devices because of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture that could endanger health. Any recall would divert management attention and financial resources and could cause the price of our stock to decline, expose us to product liability or other claims and harm our reputation with customers. Such events could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers\u2019 demands. A recall involving our silicone gel breast implants could be particularly harmful to our business, financial and operating results. Companies are required to maintain certain\nrecords of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA or similar foreign governmental authorities. We may initiate voluntary recalls involving our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA or foreign governmental authorities. If the FDA or foreign governmental authorities disagree with our determinations, they could require us to report those actions as recalls. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. In addition, the FDA or a foreign governmental authority could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted.\nIn addition, under the FDA\u2019s medical device reporting regulations, we are required to report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. Repeated product malfunctions may result in a voluntary or involuntary product recall. We are also required to follow detailed record-keeping requirements for all firm-initiated medical device corrections and removals, and to report such corrective and removal actions to FDA if they are carried out in response to a risk to health and have not otherwise been reported under the medical device reporting regulations. Depending on the corrective action we take to address a product\u2019s deficiencies or defects, the FDA may require, or we may decide, that we will need to obtain new approvals or clearances for the device before we may market or distribute the corrected device. Seeking such approvals or clearances may delay our ability to replace the recalled devices in a timely manner. Moreover, if we do not adequately address problems associated with our devices, we may face additional regulatory enforcement action, including FDA warning letters, product seizure, injunctions, administrative penalties, or civil or criminal fines. We may also be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our sales as well as face significant adverse publicity or regulatory consequences, which could harm our business, including our ability to market our products in the future.\nAny adverse event involving our products, whether in the United States or abroad, could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection, mandatory recall or other enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nIf the third parties on which we rely to conduct our clinical trials and to assist us with pre-clinical development do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for or commercialize our products.\nWe often must rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct our clinical trials and preclinical development activities. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if these third parties need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our pre-clinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for, or successfully commercialize, our products on a timely basis, if at all, and our business, operating results and prospects may be adversely affected. Furthermore, our third-party clinical trial investigators may be delayed in conducting our clinical trials for reasons outside of their control.\nWe may be subject to regulatory or enforcement actions if we engage in improper marketing or promotion of our products.\nOur educational and promotional activities and training methods must comply with FDA and other applicable laws, including the prohibition of the promotion of a medical device for a use that has not been cleared or approved by the FDA, or that is otherwise inconsistent with the FDA-required labeling. Use of a device outside the limits of its FDA-required labeling is generally referred to as \u201coff-label\u201d use. Physicians may use our products off-label in their professional medical judgment, as the FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician\u2019s choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. However, if the FDA determines that our educational and promotional activities or training constitutes promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of warning letters, untitled letters, fines, penalties, injunctions, or seizures, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation and financial results. It is\nalso possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities may take action if they consider our educational and promotional activities or training methods to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In that event, our reputation could be damaged and adoption of the products could be impaired. Although our policy is to refrain from statements that could be considered off-label promotion of our products, the FDA or another regulatory agency could disagree and conclude that we have engaged in off-label promotion. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action, such as federal prosecution under the federal civil False Claims Act, if they consider our business activities constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nCourt decisions in the past several years have impacted the FDA\u2019s assessment of whether to impose enforcement actions against manufacturers regarding off-label promotion in light of First Amendment considerations; however, there are still significant risks in this area in part due to the potential False Claims Act exposure. Further, the FDA has not materially changed its position on off-label promotion following legal setbacks on First Amendment grounds and the Department of Justice has consistently asserted in False Claims Act briefings that \u201cspeech that serves as a conduit for violations of the law is not constitutionally protected.\u201d In addition, the off-label use of our products may increase the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in substantial damage awards against us, and harm our reputation.\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state healthcare regulation, and if we fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could suffer severe criminal or civil sanctions or be required to restructure our operations, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAs a device manufacturer, even though we do not control referrals or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business, as well as other healthcare laws and regulations. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or AKS, which applies to our business activities, including our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies and relationships with healthcare providers, by prohibiting, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing any remuneration (including any bribe, kickback or rebate) directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, intended to induce or in return for the purchase or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare or Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal AKS or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation. Rather, if \u201cone purpose\u201d of the remuneration is to induce referrals, the federal AKS is violated. In addition, following passage of the PPACA violations of the federal AKS became per se violations of the False Claims Act. The potential safe harbors available, for example, relative to the AKS, are subject to change through legislative and regulatory action, and we may decide to adjust our business practices or be subject to heightened scrutiny as a result;\n\u2022\nThe compliance and enforcement landscape, and related risk, is further informed by government precedent, Advisory Opinions, and Special Fraud Alerts. For example, on November 16, 2020 the OIG published a Special Fraud Alert addressing manufacturer speaker programs signaling that such programs will be subject to an even higher degree of government scrutiny for potential AKS compliance concerns. Our approach to compliance may evolve over time in light of these types of developments;\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the FCA, that prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other government payors that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement to decrease or conceal an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government, and which may apply to entities that provide coding and billing advice to customers;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, and its implementing regulations, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by HITECH, also imposes certain regulatory and contractual requirements on certain types of people and entities subject to the law and their business associates regarding the privacy, security, breach reporting and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nthe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted under the PPACA, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to make annual reports to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, regarding any \u201ctransfers of value\u201d provided to physicians and teaching hospitals. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an additional aggregate of $1 million per year for \u201cknowing failures,\u201d for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately, and completely reported in an annual submission. We are required to report detailed payment data and submit legal attestation to the accuracy of such data by March 31st of each calendar year. Beginning January 1, 2021, payments and transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other mid-level practitioners will also need to be tracked in order to meet reporting requirements going into effect in 2022. State law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require device companies to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be provided to healthcare providers and entities; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers and entities or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of certain health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws, it is possible that some of our business activities, including our relationships with physicians and other health care providers and entities, some of whom recommend, purchase and/or prescribe our products and may receive stock awards as compensation for services provided, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, exclusion from governmental health care programs, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nChanges in existing third-party coverage and reimbursement may impact our ability to sell our products when used in breast reconstruction procedures.\nMaintaining and growing sales of our products when used in breast reconstruction procedures depends, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care programs. Breast augmentation procedures are generally performed on a cash-pay basis and are not covered by third-party payors. In contrast, breast reconstruction procedures may be covered by third-party payors. Therefore, hospitals and other healthcare provider customers that purchase our products to use in breast reconstruction procedures typically bill various third-party payors to cover all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with the procedures in which our products are used, including the cost of the purchase of our products. Decreases in the amount third-party payors are willing to\nreimburse our customers for breast reconstruction procedures using our products could create pricing pressures for us. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product or procedure may be separate from the process for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product or procedure. A payor\u2019s decision to provide coverage for a product or procedure does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor\u2019s determination to provide coverage for a product or procedure does not assure that other payors will also provide such coverage. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain our business in a profitable way. We may be unable to sell our products on a profitable basis if third-party payors deny coverage or reduce their current levels of payment, or if our costs of production increase faster than increases in reimbursement levels.\nFurthermore, the healthcare industry in the United States has experienced a trend toward cost containment as government and private insurers seek to control healthcare costs by imposing lower payment rates and negotiating reduced contract rates with service providers. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the breast reconstruction procedures using our products will be reimbursed at a cost-effective level. Nor can we be certain that third-party payors using a methodology that sets amounts based on the type of procedure performed, such as those utilized by government programs and in many privately managed care systems, will view the cost of our products to be justified so as to incorporate such costs into the overall cost of the procedure. Moreover, we are unable to predict what changes will be made to the reimbursement methodologies used by third-party payors in the future.\nTo the extent we sell our products internationally, market acceptance may depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement within prevailing healthcare payment systems. Reimbursement and healthcare payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country, and include both government-sponsored healthcare and private insurance. We may not obtain international coverage and reimbursement approvals in a timely manner, if at all. Our failure to receive such approvals would negatively impact market acceptance of our products in the international markets in which those approvals are sought.\nLegislative or regulatory health care reforms may make it more difficult and costly to produce, market and distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained, or to do so profitably.\nRecent political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the health care industry to fundamental changes. Both the federal and state governments in the United States and foreign governments continue to propose and pass new legislation and regulations designed to contain or reduce the cost of health care, improve quality of care, and expand access to healthcare, among other purposes. Such legislation and regulations may result in decreased reimbursement for medical devices and/or the procedures in which they are used, which may further exacerbate industry-wide pressure to reduce the prices charged for medical devices. This could harm our ability to market and generate sales from our products.\nIn addition, regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by governmental agencies, including the FDA, CMS, and the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d) and others, in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations, revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of our products.\nIn the future there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system. Certain of these proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amount of reimbursement available for our products, and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur customers and much of our industry are required to be compliant under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and implementing regulations (including the final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013) affecting the transmission, security and privacy of health information, and failure to comply could result in significant penalties.\nNumerous federal and state laws and regulations, including HIPAA, and HITECH, govern the collection, dissemination, security, use and confidentiality of health information that identifies specific patients. HIPAA and HITECH require our surgeon and hospital customers to comply with certain standards for the use and disclosure of health information within their companies and with third parties. The Privacy Standards and Security Standards under HIPAA establish a set of standards for the protection of individually identifiable health information by health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers, referred to as Covered Entities, and the Business\nAssociates with whom Covered Entities enter into service relationships pursuant to which individually identifiable health information may be exchanged. Notably, whereas HIPAA previously directly regulated only these Covered Entities, HITECH, which was signed into law as part of the stimulus package in February 2009, makes certain of HIPAA\u2019s privacy and security standards also directly applicable to Covered Entities\u2019 Business Associates. As a result, both Covered Entities and Business Associates are now subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with Privacy Standards and Security Standards.\nHIPAA requires Covered Entities (like our customers) and Business Associates to develop and maintain policies and procedures with respect to protected health information that is used or disclosed, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. HITECH expands the notification requirement for breaches of patient-identifiable health information, restricts certain disclosures and sales of patient-identifiable health information and provides for civil monetary penalties for HIPAA violations. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against Covered Entities and Business Associates and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Additionally, certain states have adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations, some of which may be more stringent than HIPAA.\nWe are not currently directly subject to HIPAA or HITECH because we are neither a Covered Entity nor a Business Associate (as that term is defined by HIPAA). However, in administering our warranties and complying with FDA-required device tracking, we do regularly receive confidential and personal information from our customers which may be directly subject to HIPAA. We also occasionally encounter hospital customers that require us to sign Business Associate Agreements, or BAAs, although, to date, we have generally refused, given that we do not believe we are business associates to such Covered Entities under HIPAA or HITECH. If the law or regulations were to change or if we were to agree to sign a BAA, the costs of complying with the HIPAA standards are burdensome and could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, under such situations there would be significant risks and financial penalties for us if we were then found to have violated the laws and regulations that pertain to Covered Entities and Business Associates.\nWe are unable to predict what changes to the HIPAA Privacy Standards and Security Standards might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business. Any new legislation or regulation in the area of privacy and security of personal information, including personal health information, could also adversely affect our business operations. If we do not comply with existing or new applicable federal or state laws and regulations related to patient health information, we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions and private litigation, and any resulting liability could adversely affect our financial condition.\nIn addition, even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers\u2019 personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTCA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(a). The FTC expects a company\u2019s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Medical data is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. The FTC\u2019s guidance for appropriately securing consumers\u2019 personal information is similar to what is required by the HIPAA Security Rule.\nU.S. and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations may impose additional liabilities on us.\nU.S. federal and state privacy and data security laws and regulations regulate how we and our partners collect, use and share certain information. In addition to HIPAA, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, went into effect January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. The CCPA was recently amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, expanding certain consumer rights such as the right to know. It remains unclear what, if any, additional modifications will be made to these laws by the California legislature or how these laws will be interpreted and\nenforced. The California Attorney General has issued clarifying regulations and initiating enforcement activity. The potential effects of the CCPA and CPRA are significant and may cause us to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply. The CCPA has prompted a wave of proposals for new federal and state privacy legislation, some of which may be more stringent than the CCPA, that, if passed, could increase our potential liability, increase our compliance costs, and adversely affect our business.\nWe may also be subject to or affected by foreign laws and regulations, including regulatory guidance, governing the collection, use, disclosure, security, transfer, and storage of personal data, such as information that we collect about customers and patients in connection with our operations abroad. The global legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. This evolution may create uncertainty in our business, result in liability, or impose additional costs on us. The cost of compliance with these laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to increase in the future.\nFor example, the EU implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) a broad data protection framework that expands the scope of EU data protection law to include certain non-European Union entities that process the personal data of EU residents, including clinical trial data. The GDPR increases our compliance burden with respect to data protection, including by mandating potentially burdensome documentation requirements and granting certain rights to individuals to control how we collect, use, disclose, retain and protect information about them. The processing of sensitive personal data, such as information about health conditions, leads to heightened compliance burdens under the GDPR and is a topic of active interest among EU regulators. In addition, the GDPR provides for breach reporting requirements, more robust regulatory enforcement and fines of up to the greater of 20 million euros or 4% of annual global revenue. The GDPR increases our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, which could divert management\u2019s attention and increase our cost of doing business.\nA data security breach or other privacy violation that compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the personal information of our customers, clinical trials participants, collaborators or employees could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with U.S. or international breach notification laws, subject us to mandatory corrective action, and otherwise subject us to liability under U.S. or foreign laws and regulations. Data breaches or other security incidents could also compromise our trade secrets or other intellectual property. If we are unable to prevent such data security breaches and security incidents or implement satisfactory remedial measures, our operations could be disrupted, and we may suffer reputational harm, financial loss or other regulatory penalties. In addition, such events can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm. While we have implemented security measures designed to protect our information technology systems, such measures may not prevent such events.\nFinally, it is possible that these privacy laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with federal, state, or foreign laws or self-regulatory standards could result in negative publicity, diversion of management time and effort, and proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. If we expand into other foreign countries and jurisdictions, we may be subject to additional privacy and data protection laws and regulations that may affect how we conduct business.\nAn adverse outcome of a sales and use tax or value-added tax (VAT) audit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe sell our products in all 50 states and each state (and some local governments) has its own sales tax laws and regulations. We charge each of our customers sales tax on each order and report and pay that tax to the appropriate state authority, unless we believe there is an applicable exception. In some states, there are no available exceptions; in some states, we believe our products can be sold tax-free. In other states, we believe we can sell our products tax-free only for customers who request tax-exempt treatment due to the nature of the devices we sell or due to the nature of the customer\u2019s use of our device. We also sell internationally and some sales may be subject to value-added tax. We may be audited by the taxing authorities of one or more jurisdictions and there can be no assurance, however, that an audit will be resolved in our favor. Such an audit could be expensive and time-consuming and result in substantial management distraction. If the matter were to be resolved in a manner adverse to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with the regulatory requirements for the PMA post-approval studies for our Breast Products may result in the suspension or withdrawal of our PMA.\nWe received pre-market approval, or PMA, for our silicone gel breast implants from the FDA in 2012. As a condition of PMA approval, the FDA imposes certain requirements in order to maintain the PMA. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, warning letters, administrative or judicially imposed sanctions such as injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, the suspension or withdrawal of our PMA, or criminal prosecution. For example, in March 2019, we received a warning letter from the FDA stating that we failed to meet the expected patient follow-up rate in one of our post-approval studies for our silicone gel breast implants. The warning letter stated that failure to promptly correct this deficiency may result in the withdrawal of our PMA. We provided a comprehensive response to the FDA and are working collaboratively with the agency to quickly and fully resolve this matter. If we are unable to timely correct the deficiency included in the warning letter to the satisfaction of the FDA, or if we fail to meet any of the other requirements of our PMA, our PMA may be suspended or withdrawn by the FDA. Any such suspension or withdrawal would have a significant negative impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nIn 2017, we settled a securities class action lawsuit and have reached a settlement agreement with the SEC. If we are subject to additional claims, our insurance may not be sufficient to cover additional expenses incurred.\nIn May 2017, we settled a class action lawsuit which named the Company and certain of its officers as defendants for allegedly false and misleading statements concerning the Company\u2019s business, operations, and prospects in connection with the Company\u2019s September 2015 common stock offering, or the 2015 offering. In connection with the settlement, we received $9.3 million in insurance proceeds to pay the settlement amount.\nIn March 2018, we reached an agreement-in-principle with the Staff of the Division of Enforcement, or the Staff, of the SEC to settle, without admitting or denying, charges arising out of the SEC\u2019s investigation into alleged false and misleading statements or omissions made in connection with the 2015 offering. Those charges included alleged violations of Section 10 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and Sections 17(a)(1)-(3) of the Securities Act. On September 19, 2018, the SEC issued an order approving the terms of the settlement agreement.\nWe may, in the future, be subject to regulatory claims, including claims for violations of the federal securities laws, rules and regulations, and may also need to defend claims against our current or former directors and officers. If that occurs, we may be required to pay a monetary settlement or judgment and we may not have sufficient insurance coverage remaining to cover the costs of any such claims or any related potential indemnification obligations to our current or former directors and officers. Moreover, even if these claims against us are not successful, the defense of such claims could result in substantial costs and significant adverse impact on our reputation and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile, and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In recent years, the stock markets generally have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may significantly affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends is currently prohibited by our Credit Agreements. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant.\nAs a public company, we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis, and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with certain of the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, regarding internal control over financial reporting, including a report of management on the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting in their annual reports on Form 10-K.\nFor as long as we remain a smaller reporting company with less than $100 million in annual revenues, we are exempt from the requirement that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If our internal control over financial reporting or our related disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2019 and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which may result in material misstatements of our financial statements or could have a material adverse effect on our business and trading price of our securities.\nIn connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, our control environment process was ineffective for holding individuals accountable for the operation of their internal control responsibilities. This control failure prevented the effective operating of management review controls over goodwill and intangible asset impairment, including the underlying financial data, calculations, and assumptions supporting the forecasted financial information utilized to measure the fair value of the reporting unit, intangible assets, and the associated impairment charges. This deficiency did not result in an adjustment but still represented a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 because there is a reasonable possibility that material misstatements to our consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe have designed and implemented measures to remediate the underlying causes of the control deficiencies that gave rise to the material weakness. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these controls and will make any further changes management determines appropriate.\nWe cannot assure you that any measures we may take in the future will be sufficient to avoid potential future material weaknesses. If we are unable to successfully remediate any future material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or if we identify any additional material weaknesses, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected. If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls, we may not have adequate, accurate or timely financial information, and we may be unable to meet our reporting obligations as a public company, including the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results in future periods, or report them within the timeframes required by the requirements of the SEC, Nasdaq or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, when and as applicable, could also potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in identification of additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Furthermore, if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and results of operations could be harmed and investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that our officers, directors or the holders of a large number of shares of common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nCertain holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to certain rights, subject to some conditions, with respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act.\nWe cannot predict what effect, if any, sales of our shares in the public market or the availability of shares for sale will have on the market price of our common stock. Future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including shares issued upon exercise of outstanding options or warrants, or the perception that such sales may occur, however, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and also could adversely affect our future ability to raise capital through the sale of our common stock or other equity-related securities of ours at times and prices we believe appropriate.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe expect that significant additional capital may be needed in the future to continue our planned operations, including conducting clinical trials, commercialization efforts, expanded research and development activities and costs associated with operating a public company. To raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to the holders of our common stock. Information regarding our equity securities is provided in this Annual Report in \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 10.\u201d\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and under Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could reduce our stock price and prevent our stockholders from replacing or removing our current management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. Some of these provisions include:\n\u2022\na board of directors divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms, such that not all members of the board will be elected at one time;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action through written consent, which requires that all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\na requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, or by a majority of the total number of authorized directors;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022\na requirement that no member of our board of directors may be removed from office by our stockholders except for cause and, in addition to any other vote required by law, upon the approval of not less than two-thirds of all outstanding shares of our voting stock then entitled to vote in the election of directors;\n\u2022\na requirement of approval of not less than two-thirds of all outstanding shares of our voting stock to amend any bylaws by stockholder action or to amend specific provisions of our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022\nthe authority of the board of directors to issue preferred stock on terms determined by the board of directors without stockholder approval and which preferred stock may include rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock.\nWe are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current board of directors, including a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our Company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our clinical trials and operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us, or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provisions of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, any action or proceeding asserting a claim as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, subject in each case to the Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the parties named as defendants therein. The exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we might incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.", "PERMNO": 15016, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "SIEN"}
