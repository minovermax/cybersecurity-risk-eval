{"cik": "933974", "company": "BROOKS AUTOMATION INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-11-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nFactors That May Affect Future Results\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this report before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock. These are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and operating results would likely suffer. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nDue in part to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor manufacturing industry and related industries, as well as due to volatility in worldwide capital and equity markets, we have previously incurred operating losses and may have future losses.\nOur business is largely dependent on capital expenditures in the semiconductor manufacturing industry and other businesses employing similar manufacturing technologies. The semiconductor manufacturing industry in turn depends on current and anticipated demand for integrated circuits and the products that use them. In recent years, these businesses have experienced unpredictable and volatile business cycles due in large part to rapid changes in demand and manufacturing capacity for semiconductors, and these cycles have had an impact on our business, sometimes causing declines in revenue and operating losses. We could experience future operating losses during an industry downturn. If an industry downturn continues for an extended period of time, our business could be materially harmed. Conversely, in periods of rapidly increasing demand, we could have insufficient inventory and manufacturing capacity to meet our\ncustomers\u2019 needs on a timely basis, which could result in the loss of customers and various other expenses that could reduce gross margins and profitability.\nWe face competition which may lead to price pressure and otherwise adversely affect our sales.\nWe face competition throughout the world in each of our product and service areas, including from the competitors discussed in Part I, Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Competition\u201d as well as from internal automation capabilities at larger OEMs. Many of our competitors have substantial engineering, manufacturing, marketing and customer support capabilities. In addition, strategic initiatives in China to encourage local semiconductor manufacturing and supply chain could increase competition from domestic equipment manufacturers in China. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and services and to introduce new products, services and technologies that could adversely affect sales of our current and future products and services. New products, services and technologies developed by our competitors or more efficient production of their products or provisions of their services could require us to make significant price reductions or decide not to compete for certain orders. If we fail to respond adequately to pricing pressures or fail to develop products with improved performance or better quality services with respect to the other factors on which we compete, we could lose customers or orders. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business and prospects could be materially harmed.\nRisks Relating to Our Operations\nOur operating results could fluctuate significantly, which could negatively impact our business.\nOur revenue, operating margins and other operating results could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon a variety of factors, including:\n\u00b7\ndemand for our products as a result of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor manufacturing industry and the markets upon which the industry depends or otherwise;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the timing and terms of product orders by our customers as a result of our customer concentration or otherwise;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the demand for the mix of products and services that we offer;\n\u00b7\ntiming and market acceptance of our new product and services introductions;\n\u00b7\ndelays or problems in the planned introduction of new products or services, or in the performance of any such products following delivery to customers or the quality of such services;\n\u00b7\nnew products, services or technological innovations by our competitors, which can, among other things, render our products less competitive due to the rapid technological changes in the markets in which we provide products and services;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and related costs of any acquisitions, divestitures or other strategic transactions;\n\u00b7\nour ability to reduce our costs in response to decreased demand for our products and services;\n\u00b7\nour ability to accurately estimate customer demand, including the accuracy of demand forecasts used by us;\n\u00b7\ndisruptions in our manufacturing process or in the supply of components to us;\n\u00b7\nwrite-offs for excess or obsolete inventory;\n\u00b7\ncompetitive pricing pressures; and\n\u00b7\nincreased amount of investment into the infrastructure to support our growth, including capital equipment, research and development, as well as selling and marketing initiatives to support continuous product\ninnovation, technological capability enhancements and sales efforts. The timing of revenue generation coupled with the increased amount of investment may result in operating losses.\nAs a result of these risks, we believe that reference to past performance for comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful, and that these comparisons may not be an accurate indicator of our future performance.\nIf we do not continue to introduce new products and services that reflect advances in technology in a timely and effective manner, our products and services may become obsolete and our operating results will suffer.\nOur success is dependent on our ability to respond to the technological changes present in the markets we serve. The success of our product development and introduction of products to market depends on our ability to:\n\u00b7\nidentify and define new market opportunities, products and services in accurate manner;\n\u00b7\nobtain market acceptance of our products and services;\n\u00b7\ninnovate, develop and commercialize new technologies and applications in a timely manner;\n\u00b7\nadjust to changing market conditions;\n\u00b7\ndifferentiate our offerings from our competitors\u2019 offerings;\n\u00b7\nobtain and maintain intellectual property rights where necessary;\n\u00b7\ncontinue to develop a comprehensive, integrated product and service strategy;\n\u00b7\nprice our products and services appropriately; and\n\u00b7\ndesign our products to high standards of manufacturability so that they meet customer requirements.\nIf we cannot succeed in responding in a timely manner to technological and/or market changes or if the new products and services that we introduce do not achieve market acceptance, our competitive position would diminish which could materially harm our business and our prospects.\nThe global nature of our business exposes us to multiple risks.\nDuring fiscal years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, approximately 65% and 63% of our revenue was derived from sales outside of North America. We expect that international sales, including increased sales in Asia, will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue. We maintain a global footprint of sales, service and repair operations. As a result of our international operations, we are exposed to many risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u00b7\nlonger sales-cycles and time to collection;\n\u00b7\ntariff and international trade barriers;\n\u00b7\nfewer or less certain legal protections for intellectual property and contract rights abroad;\n\u00b7\ndifferent and changing legal and regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate;\n\u00b7\ngovernment currency control and restrictions on repatriation of earnings;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates, particularly in Asia and Europe; and\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic instability, changes, hostilities and other disruptions in regions where we operate.\nNegative developments in any of these areas in one or more countries could result in a reduction in demand for our products, the cancellation or delay of orders already placed, threats to our intellectual property, difficulty in collecting receivables, and a higher cost of doing business, any of which could materially harm our business and profitability.\nOur business could be materially harmed if we fail to adequately integrate the operations of the businesses that we have acquired or may acquire.\nWe have made in the past, and may make in the future, acquisitions or significant investments in businesses with complementary products, services and/or technologies. Our acquisitions present numerous risks, including:\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies and realizing the anticipated synergies of the combined businesses;\n\u00b7\ndefining and executing a comprehensive product strategy;\n\u00b7\nmanaging the risks of entering markets or types of businesses in which we have limited or no direct experience;\n\u00b7\nthe potential loss of key employees, customers and strategic partners of ours or of acquired companies;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated problems or latent liabilities, such as problems with the quality of the installed base of the target company\u2019s products or infringement of another company\u2019s intellectual property by a target company\u2019s activities or products;\n\u00b7\nproblems associated with compliance with the acquired company\u2019s existing contracts;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations; and\n\u00b7\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of the business.\nIf we acquire a new business, we may expend significant funds, incur additional debt or issue additional securities, which may negatively affect our operations and be dilutive to our stockholders. In periods following an acquisition, we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment. If such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, with a charge against earnings. The failure to adequately address these risks or the impairment of any assets could materially harm our business and financial results.\nExpanding within current markets introduces new competitors and commercial risks.\nA key part of our growth strategy is to continue expanding within the life sciences sample management market. As part of this strategy, we expect to diversify our product sales and service revenue by leveraging our core technologies, which requires investments and resources which may not be available as needed. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in leveraging our capabilities into the life sciences sample management market to meet all the needs of new customers and to compete favorably. Because a significant portion of our growth potential may be dependent on our ability to increase sales within the life science sample management market, our inability to successfully expand within such market may adversely impact future financial results.\nChanges in key personnel could impair our ability to execute our business strategy.\nThe continuing service of our executive officers and essential engineering, technical and management personnel, together with our ability to attract and retain such personnel, is an important factor in our continuing ability to execute our strategy. There is substantial competition to attract such employees and the loss of any such key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. The same could be true if we were to experience a high turnover rate among engineering and technical personnel and we were unable to replace them.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our future operations.\nOur ability to compete is significantly affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely upon patents, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, copyrights, trademarks and licensing agreements to protect our technology. Existing trade secret, trademark and copyright laws offer only limited protection. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and enforce patent protection for our products both in the United States and in other countries. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents, and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products and technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold may not fully protect our products. Due to the rapid technological change that characterizes the semiconductor and adjacent technology markets, we believe that the improvement of existing technology, reliance upon trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know-how and the development of new products may be as important as patent protection in establishing and maintaining competitive advantage. To protect trade secrets and know-how, it is our policy to require all technical and management personnel to enter into nondisclosure agreements.\nWe cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation of our technology. Other companies could independently develop similar or superior technology without violating our intellectual property rights. In the future, it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. This could require us to incur significant expenses and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations.\nThe expiration of our patents over time could lead to an increase of competition and a decline in our revenue.\nOne of our main competitive strengths is our technology, and we are dependent on our patent rights and other intellectual property rights to maintain our competitive position. Our current patents will expire from time to time through 2035 which could result in increased competition and declines in product and service revenue.\nWe may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, or demands that we license third-party technology, which could result in significant expense and prevent us from using our technology.\nThere has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the semiconductor-related industries. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by third parties. We cannot guarantee that infringement claims by third parties or other claims for indemnification by customers or end-users of our products resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted in the future or that such assertions, whether or not proven to be true, will not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which we might be required to seek licenses or alter our products so that they no longer infringe the rights of others. We also cannot guarantee that licenses will be available or the terms of any licenses we may be required to obtain will be reasonable. Similarly, changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical and could detract from the value of our products. If a judgment of infringement were obtained against us, we could be required to pay substantial damages and a court could issue an order preventing us from selling one or more of our products. Further, the cost and diversion of management attention brought about by such litigation could be substantial, even if we were to prevail. Any of these events could result in significant expense to us and may materially harm our business and our prospects.\nUnexpected events could disrupt our sample storage operations and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\nUnexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters, such as tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes, war or terrorist activities, unplanned power outages, supply disruptions and failure of equipment or systems, could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. Our Brooks Life Science Systems\u2019 service customers rely on us to securely store and timely retrieve and transport their critical samples, and these events could\nresult in service disruptions, physical damage to one or more key storage facilities and the customer samples stored in those facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of service, each of which could negatively impact our reputation and results of operations. Our primary storage facility is located in Indianapolis, Indiana, an area of the United States that can be prone to tornado and other severe weather events.\nIf our manufacturing sites were to experience a significant disruption in operations, our business could be materially harmed, while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory.\nWe have a limited number of manufacturing facilities for our products and we have moved portions of our manufacturing to third parties, including some in lesser developed countries. If the operations at any one of these facilities were disrupted as a result of a natural disaster, fire, power or other utility outage, work stoppage or other similar event, our business could be seriously harmed because we may be unable to manufacture and ship products and parts to our customers in a timely fashion. The impact of any disruption at one of our facilities may be exacerbated if the disruption occurs at a time when we need to rapidly increase our manufacturing capabilities to meet increased demand or expedited shipment schedules.\nMoreover, if actual demand for our products is different than expected, we may purchase more/fewer component parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of such parts. If we purchase inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or if our customers reduce or delay orders, we may incur excess inventory charges. Any or all of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be materially harmed if one or more key suppliers fail to continuously deliver key components of acceptable cost and quality.\nWe currently obtain many of our key components on an as-needed, purchase order basis from numerous suppliers. In some cases we have only a single source of supply for key components and materials used in the manufacturing of our products. Further, we are increasing our sourcing of products in Asia, and particularly in China, and we do not have a previous history of dealing with many of these suppliers. Our inability to obtain components or materials in required quantities or of acceptable cost and quality and with the necessary continuity of supply could result in delays or reductions in product shipments to our customers. In addition, if a supplier or sub-supplier suffers a production stoppage or delay for any reason, including natural disasters such as the tsunamis that affected Japan and Thailand, this could result in a delay or reduction in our product shipments to our customers. Any of these contingencies could cause us to lose customers, result in delayed or lost revenue and otherwise materially harm our business.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a decline in the availability of raw materials.\nWe are dependent on the availability of certain key raw materials and natural resources used in our products and various manufacturing processes, and we rely on third parties to supply us with these materials in a cost-effective and timely manner. Our access to raw materials may be adversely affected if our suppliers\u2019 operations were disrupted as a result of limited or delayed access to key raw materials and natural resources which may result in increased cost of these items. While most of the raw materials used in our products and various manufacturing processes are commercially available, we rely in some cases on materials that have a limited supply and are considered rare Earth elements, such as helium. If the supply of these elements is drastically reduced, it may lead to price increases which could result in higher costs of our products and corresponding revenue declines and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur outsource providers may fail to perform as we expect.\nOutsource providers have played and will continue to play a key role in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology and facilities management. Although we attempt to select reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts, it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur business relies on certain critical information systems and a failure or breach of such a system could harm our business and results of operations and, in the event of unauthorized access to a customer\u2019s data or our data, incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.\nWe maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business. These information systems include telecommunications, the internet, our corporate intranet, various computer hardware and software applications, network communications and e-mail. These information systems may be owned and maintained by us, our outsource providers or third parties such as vendors and contractors. These information systems are subject to attacks, failures, and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses, destructive or inadequate code, power failures, and physical damage to computers, hard drives, communication lines and networking equipment. To the extent that these information systems are under our control, we have implemented security procedures, such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes, to mitigate the outlined risks. However, security procedures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time, or unauthorized releases of confidential information, could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business.\nConfidential information stored on these information systems could also be compromised. If a third party gains unauthorized access to our data, including any information regarding our customers, such security breach could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, loss of business, litigation and possible liability. These security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. Additionally, third parties may fraudulently attempt to induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers\u2019 data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence by our customers, damage our reputation, disrupt our business, lead to legal liability and negatively impact our future sales.\nOur goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired.\nAs of September 30, 2017, we had $233.6 million of goodwill and $83.5 million in net intangible assets as a result of our acquisitions. We periodically review our goodwill and the estimated useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets, taking into consideration any events or circumstances that might result in either a diminished fair value, or for intangible assets, a revised useful life. These events and circumstances include significant changes in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, advances in technology and competition. Any impairment or revised useful life could have a material and adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations, and could harm the trading price of our common stock.\nChanges in tax rates or tax regulation could affect results of operations.\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Our future annual and quarterly effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the: applicable tax laws; composition of pre-tax income in countries with differing tax rates; and/or establishment of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets based on the assessment of their realizability prior to expiration. In addition, we are subject to regular examination by the Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous governmental regulations.\nWe are subject to federal, state, local and foreign regulations, including environmental regulations and regulations relating to the design and operation of our products and control systems. We might incur significant costs as we seek to\nensure that our products meet safety and emissions standards, many of which vary across the states and countries in which our products are used. In the past, we have invested significant resources to redesign our products to comply with these directives. Compliance with future regulations, directives, and standards could require us to modify or redesign some products, make capital expenditures, or incur substantial costs. If we do not comply with current or future regulations, directives, and standards:\n\u00b7\nwe could be subject to fines;\n\u00b7\nour production or shipments could be suspended; and\n\u00b7\nwe could be prohibited from offering particular products in specified markets.\nAny of these events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulations and customer demands related to conflict minerals may adversely affect us.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act imposes disclosure requirements regarding the use in components of our products of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, whether the components of our products are manufactured by us or third parties. This requirement could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of components we use in our products. In addition, there are additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements and customer requests, such as costs related to our due diligence to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. We may face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free and/or free of numerous other hazardous materials.\nUnfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations may lead to lower operating margins, or may cause us to raise prices, which could result in reduced sales.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations and we could experience losses with respect to forward exchange contracts into which we may enter. Unfavorable currency fluctuations could require us to increase prices to foreign customers, which could result in lower net sales by us to such customers. Alternatively, if we do not adjust the prices for our products in response to unfavorable currency fluctuations, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, most sales made by our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the currency of the country in which these products are sold and the currency they receive in payment for such sales could be less valuable as compared to the U.S. dollar at the time of receipt as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. From time to time, we enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce currency exposure. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be adequate to protect us against significant currency fluctuations or that such efforts will not expose us to additional exchange rate risks, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisk related to the referendum of the United Kingdom\u2019s membership in the European Union\nIn June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom voted \u201cfor\u201d the Referendum of the United Kingdom\u2019s Membership in the European Union, referred to as Brexit, approving the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, which triggered volatility in exchange rate fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct our business. We may experience volatility in exchange rates as the United Kingdom negotiates its exit from the European Union. As described in Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\", of this 10-K, most of our foreign currency denominated transactions are conducted in Euros, British Pounds and a variety of Asian currencies. Sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollar were approximately 33% and 34%, respectively, of our total sales during fiscal years 2017 and 2016. If a dollar strengthens, our revenue denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected when translated into U.S. dollars.\nThe announcement of Brexit has also created global economic uncertainty, which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending on our products and services. The effects of Brexit depends on any agreements the United Kingdom makes to retain access to European Union markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. The measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and may cause us to lose customers and\nemployees. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to operate our business, generate cash flows and make payments on such indebtedness\nOn October 4, 2017, we entered into a $200.0 million Senior Secured Term Loan Facility, or term loan, with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC. The term loan matures and becomes fully payable on October 4, 2024. We would be required to redeem the term loan at the principal amount then outstanding upon occurrence of certain events, as described in the term loan agreement. For further information on this transaction, please refer to Note 21, \"Subsequent Events\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K.\nOur ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and maintain sufficient liquidity to service such debt. The loan borrowings are subject to variable interest rates which create exposure to interest rate risk. Interest rate increases may result in higher cost of servicing the loan and reduce our profitability and cash flows. The terms of our debt covenants could limit our ability to raise additional funds and the manner in which we conduct our business. We have the ability to refinance the term loan and obtain additional indebtedness as long as we maintain a certain level of liquidity and earnings, as specified in the loan agreement. If our liquidity and earnings are reduced below a certain level, we will have limited ability to service the term loan and obtain additional debt financing. Our failure to comply with these restrictive covenants could also result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of our indebtedness. Accordingly, a default would have a material adverse effect on our business and our lender would have the right to exercise its rights and remedies to collect, which would include the right to foreclose on our assets.\nRisks Relating to Our Customers\nBecause we rely on a limited number of customers for a large portion of our revenue, the loss of one or more of these customers could materially harm our business.\nWe receive a significant portion of our revenue in each fiscal period from a relatively limited number of customers, and that trend is likely to continue. Sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 39%, 34% and 38%, respectively, of our total revenue in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The loss of one or more of these major customers, a significant decrease in orders from one of these customers, or the inability of one or more customers to make payments to us when they are due could materially affect our revenue, business and reputation. In addition, there has been and may continue to be significant consolidation among some of our largest OEM customers, which could lead to increased pressure to reduce the price of our products and/or decreased market share of our products with the combined companies.\nBecause of the lengthy sales cycles of many of our products, we may incur significant expenses before we generate any revenue related to those products.\nOur customers may need several months to test and evaluate our products. This increases the possibility that a customer may decide to cancel an order or change its plans, which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. The impact of this risk can be magnified during the periods in which we introduce a number of new products, as has been the case in recent years. As a result of this lengthy sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses before we generate the related revenue for these products, and we may never generate the anticipated revenue if our customer cancels an order or changes its plans.\nIn addition, many of our products will not be sold directly to the end-user but will be components of other products manufactured by OEMs. As a result, we rely on OEMs to select our products from among alternative offerings to be incorporated into their equipment at the design stage; so-called design-ins. The OEMs\u2019 decisions often precede the generation of volume sales, if any, by a year or more. Moreover, if we are unable to achieve these design-ins from an OEM, we would have difficulty selling our products to that OEM because changing suppliers after design-ins involves significant cost, time, effort and risk on the part of that OEM.\nCustomers generally do not make long term commitments to purchase our products and our customers may cease purchasing our products at any time.\nSales of our products are often made pursuant to individual purchase orders and not under long-term commitments and contracts. Our customers frequently do not provide any assurance of minimum or future sales and are not prohibited from purchasing products from our competitors at any time. Accordingly, we are exposed to competitive pricing pressures on each order. Our customers also engage in the practice of purchasing products from more than one manufacturer to avoid dependence on sole-source suppliers for certain of their needs. The existence of these practices makes it more difficult for us to increase price, gain new customers and win repeat business from existing customers.\nWe may face claims for liability related to damages of customer materials attributed to the failure of our products or services, exposing us to significant financial or reputational harm.\nOur automation products for the semiconductor manufacturing market are used in the handling and movement of silicon wafers at various points in the production process, and our automated cold storage systems for the life sciences sample management market are used in the handling, movement and storage of biological and chemical samples. We also provide sample storage services to customers where we store their biological and chemical samples at our facilities. In any case, damage to our customers\u2019 materials may be attributed to a failure of our products or services which could lead to claims for damages made by our customers and could also harm our relationship with our customers and damage our reputation in each of these industries, resulting in material harm to our business.\nRisks Relating to Owning Our Securities\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely. From the beginning of fiscal year 2016 through the end of fiscal year 2017, our stock price fluctuated between a high of $30.36 per share and a low of $8.48 per share. Consequently, the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices, and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock. Factors affecting our stock price may include:\n\u00b7\nvariations in operating results from quarter to quarter;\n\u00b7\nchanges in earnings estimates by analysts or our failure to meet analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the market price per share of our public company customers;\n\u00b7\nmarket conditions in the semiconductor and other industries into which we sell products and services;\n\u00b7\nglobal economic conditions;\n\u00b7\npolitical changes, hostilities or natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods;\n\u00b7\nlow trading volume of our common stock; and\n\u00b7\nthe number of firms making a market in our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock market has in the past experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have particularly affected the market prices of the securities of high technology companies like ours. These market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may not pay dividends on our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock are only entitled to receive dividends when and if they are declared by our Board of Directors. Although we have declared cash dividends on our common stock for the past several years, we are not\nrequired to do so and may reduce or eliminate our cash dividends in the future. This could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents and, Delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of us, which could decrease the value of your shares.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board of Directors. These provisions include limitations on actions by our stockholders by written consent, the inability of stockholders to call special meetings and the potential for super majority votes of our stockholders in certain circumstances. In addition, our Board of Directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation makes us subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits publicly held Delaware corporations to which it applies from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. This provision could discourage others from bidding for our shares of common stock and could, as a result, reduce the likelihood of an increase in the price of our common stock that would otherwise occur if a bidder sought to buy our common stock.\nDelaware law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. Although we believe these provisions provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by stockholders. If a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of blank check preferred stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that our Board of Directors is authorized to issue from time to time, without further stockholder approval, up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix and designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights and terms of redemption and liquidation preferences. Such shares of preferred stock could have preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights. Our issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control. Our issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of common stock. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of decreasing the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 81241, "SIC": 3559, "TIC": "BRKS"}
