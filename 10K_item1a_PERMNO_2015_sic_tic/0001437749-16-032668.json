{"cik": "1616262", "company": "Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-05-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nGeneral Economic Conditions Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on our Business, Results of Operations and Liquidity.\nConsumer purchases of discretionary items, including our products, generally decline during weak economic periods and other periods where disposable income is adversely affected. Our performance is subject to factors that affect worldwide economic conditions including employment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth based on severe market declines, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, fuel and energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, value of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies and other macroeconomic factors. These factors may cause consumers to purchase products from lower priced competitors or to defer purchases of products altogether.\nEconomic weakness could have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. It could also impact our ability to fund growth and/or result in us becoming more reliant on external financing, the availability and terms of which may be uncertain. In addition, a weak economic environment may exacerbate the risks noted below.\nOur Sales to Specialty Market Customers, Customers Outside Our System of Franchised Stores, Are Concentrated Among a Small Number of Customers.\nRevenue from one customer of the Company\u2019s manufacturing segment represented approximately $5.2 million or 13% of the Company\u2019s revenues during the year ended February 29, 2016. The Company\u2019s future results may be adversely impacted by a change in the purchases of this customer.\nOur Growth is Dependent Upon Attracting and Retaining Qualified Franchisees and Their Ability to Operate Their Franchised Stores Successfully.\nOur continued growth and success is dependent in part upon our ability to attract, retain and contract with qualified franchisees. Our growth is dependent upon the ability of franchisees to operate their stores successfully, promote and develop our store concepts, and maintain our reputation for an enjoyable in-store experience and high quality products. Although we have established criteria to evaluate prospective franchisees and have been successful in attracting franchisees, there can be no assurance that franchisees will be able to operate successfully in their franchise areas in a manner consistent with our concepts and standards.\nOur Expansion Plans Are Dependent on the Availability of Suitable Sites for Franchised Stores at Reasonable Occupancy Costs.\nOur expansion plans are critically dependent on our ability to obtain suitable sites at reasonable occupancy costs for our franchised stores in high foot traffic retail environments. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain suitable locations for our franchised stores and kiosks in this environment at a cost that will allow such stores to be economically viable.\nA Significant Shift by Franchisees from Company-Manufactured Products to Products Produced By Third Parties Could Adversely Affect Our Operations.\nWe believe approximately 45% of franchised stores' revenues are generated by sales of products manufactured by and purchased from us, 50% by sales of products made in the stores with ingredients purchased from us or approved suppliers and 5% by sales of products purchased from approved suppliers for resale in the stores. Franchisees' sales of products manufactured by us generate higher revenues to us than sales of store-made or other products. We have seen a significant increase in system-wide sales of store-made and other products, which has led to a decrease in purchases from us and an adverse effect on our revenues. If this trend continues, it could further adversely affect our total revenues and results of operations. Such a decrease could result from franchisees' decisions to sell more store-made products or products purchased from approved third party suppliers.\nSame Store Sales Have Fluctuated and Will Continue to Fluctuate on a Regular Basis.\nOur same store sales, defined as year-over-year sales for a store that has been open at least one year, have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual and quarterly basis and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. During the past five fiscal years, same store sales results have fluctuated as follows: (a) from 0.2% to 3.1% for annual results; (b) from (2.9%) to 7.5% for quarterly results. Sustained declines in same store sales or significant same store sales declines in any single period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIncreases in Costs Could Adversely Affect Our Operations.\nInflationary factors such as increases in the costs of ingredients, energy and labor directly affect our operations. Most of our leases provide for cost-of-living adjustments and require us to pay taxes, insurance and maintenance expenses, all of which are subject to inflation. Additionally, our future lease costs for new facilities may reflect potentially escalating costs of real estate and construction. There is no assurance that we will be able to pass on our increased costs to our customers.\nThe Availability and Price of Principal Ingredients Used in Our Products Are Subject to Factors Beyond Our Control.\nSeveral of the principal ingredients used in our products, including chocolate and nuts, are subject to significant price fluctuations. Although cocoa beans, the primary raw material used in the production of chocolate, are grown commercially in Africa, Brazil and several other countries around the world, cocoa beans are traded in the commodities market, and their supply and price are subject to volatility. We believe our principal chocolate supplier purchases most of its beans at negotiated prices from African growers, often at a premium to commodity prices. The supply and price of cocoa beans, and in turn of chocolate, are affected by many factors, including monetary fluctuations and economic, political and weather conditions in countries in which cocoa beans are grown. We purchase most of our nut meats from domestic suppliers who procure their products from growers around the world. The price and supply of nuts are also affected by many factors, including weather conditions in the various regions in which the nuts we use are grown. Although we often enter into purchase contracts for these products, significant or prolonged increases in the prices of chocolate or of one or more types of nuts, or the unavailability of adequate supplies of chocolate or nuts of the quality sought by us, could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations.\nWe Now Own 100% of the Operations of U-Swirl, Which Has a History of Losses and May Continue to Report Losses in the Future.\nIn January 2013, we obtained a controlling ownership interest in SWRL. This interest was the result of a transaction designed to create a self-serve frozen yogurt company through the combination of three formerly separate self-serve frozen yogurt retailers (U-Swirl, Yogurtini and Aspen Leaf Yogurt). SWRL has historically reported net losses and may continue to report losses in future periods. In February 2016, we foreclosed on the all of the outstanding common stock of U-Swirl (the operating subsidiary of SWRL) in full satisfaction of the obligations under the SWRL Loan Agreement, meaning that U-Swirl is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. If U-Swirl continues to report losses, those losses will be attributed only to the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nWe And Our Subsidiaries May Be Unable To Successfully Integrate The Operations Of Acquired Businesses And May Not Achieve The Cost Savings And Increased Revenues Anticipated As A Result Of These Acquisitions.\nOver the past three years, U-Swirl has acquired a number of other yogurt franchising businesses. Achieving the anticipated benefits of acquisitions will depend in part upon our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to integrate these businesses in an efficient and effective manner. The integration of companies that have previously operated independently may result in significant challenges, and we and our subsidiaries may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully. The integration of acquired businesses may also require the dedication of significant management resources, which may temporarily distract management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operations of the Company. In addition, the process of integrating operations may cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 businesses and the loss of key personnel from us or the acquired businesses. Our and our subsidiaries\u2019 strategy is, in part, predicated on the ability to realize cost savings and to increase revenues through the acquisition of businesses that add to the breadth and depth of our products and services. Achieving these cost savings and revenue increases is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe Seasonality of Our Sales and New Store Openings Can Have a Significant Impact on Our Financial Results from Quarter to Quarter.\nOur sales and earnings are seasonal, with significantly higher sales and earnings occurring during key holidays and summer vacation season than at other times of the year, which causes fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations. In addition, quarterly results have been, and in the future are likely to be, affected by the timing of new store openings and the sale of franchises. Because of the seasonality of our business and the impact of new store openings and sales of franchises, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved in other quarters or for a full fiscal year. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nWe Are Subject to Federal, State and Local Regulation.\nWe are subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission and must comply with certain state laws governing the offer, sale and termination of franchises and the refusal to renew franchises. Many state laws also regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship by, for example, requiring the franchisor to deal with its franchisees in good faith, prohibiting interference with the right of free association among franchisees and regulating discrimination among franchisees in charges, royalties or fees. Franchise laws continue to develop and change, and changes in such laws could impose additional costs and burdens on franchisors. Our failure to obtain approvals to sell franchises and the adoption of new franchise laws, or changes in existing laws, could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations.\nEach of our Company-owned and franchised stores is subject to licensing and regulation by the health, sanitation, safety, building and fire agencies in the state or municipality where located. Difficulties or failures in obtaining required licenses or approvals from such agencies could delay or prevent the opening of a new store. We and our franchisees are also subject to laws governing our relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working and safety conditions and citizenship requirements. Because a significant number of our employees are paid at rates related to the federal minimum wage, increases in the minimum wage would increase our labor costs. The failure to obtain required licenses or approvals, or an increase in the minimum wage rate, employee benefits costs (including costs associated with mandated health insurance coverage) or other costs associated with employees, could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations.\nCompanies engaged in the manufacturing, packaging and distribution of food products are subject to extensive regulation by various governmental agencies. A finding of a failure to comply with one or more regulations could result in the imposition of sanctions, including the closing of all or a portion of our facilities for an indeterminate period of time, and could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations.\nThe Retailing of Confectionery and Frozen Dessert Products is Highly Competitive and Many of Our Competitors Have Competitive Advantages Over Us.\nThe retailing of confectionery and frozen dessert products is highly competitive. We and our franchisees compete with numerous businesses that offer similar products. Many of these competitors have greater name recognition and financial, marketing and other resources than we do. In addition, there is intense competition among retailers for real estate sites, store personnel and qualified franchisees. Competitive market conditions could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations and our ability to expand successfully.\nChanges in Consumer Tastes and Trends Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Operations.\nThe sale of our products is affected by changes in consumer tastes and eating habits, including views regarding consumption of chocolate and frozen yogurt. Numerous other factors that we cannot control, such as economic conditions, demographic trends, traffic patterns and weather conditions, influence the sale of our products. Changes in any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations.\nChanges in Health Benefit Claims and Healthcare Reform Legislation Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Operations.\nWe accrue for costs to provide self-insured benefits for our employee health benefits program. We accrue for self-insured health benefits based on historical claims experience and we maintain insurance coverage to prevent financial losses from catastrophic health benefit claims. We monitor pending and enacted legislation in an effort to evaluate the effects of such legislation upon our business. Our financial position or results of operations could be materially adversely impacted should we experience a material increase in claims costs or a change in healthcare legislation that impacts our business. Our accrued liability for self-insured employee health benefits at February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015 was $78,200 and $67,400, respectively.\nOur Expansion Into New Markets May Present Increased Risks Due To Our Unfamiliarity With Those Areas And Our Target Customers\u2019 Unfamiliarity With Our Brands.\nConsumers in any new markets we enter will not be familiar with our brands, and we will need to build brand awareness in those markets through significant investments in advertising and promotional activity. We may find it more difficult in our markets to secure desirable locations and to hire, motivate and keep qualified employees.\nWe May Not Be Able To Successfully Execute A Franchising And Area Developer Strategy Or Attract Independent Franchise Developers.\nTo achieve our expansion goals, we have adopted a franchising and area developer model into our business strategy. We have also acquired businesses that have adopted a similar developer model. We plan to solicit franchisees for our U-Swirl concept. We may not be successful in attracting franchisees and developers to the U-Swirl concept or identifying franchisees and developers that have the business abilities or access to financial resources necessary to open our U-Swirl locations or to develop or operate successfully our frozen yogurt locations in a manner consistent with our standards. Further, incorporating a franchising and area developer model into our strategy has required us to devote significant management and financial resources to prepare for and support the eventual sale of franchises. If we are not successful in incorporating a franchising or area developer model into our strategy, or we are unsuccessful in attracting independent franchise developers, we may experience delays in our growth, or may not be able to expand and grow our business.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions In Our Certificate Of Incorporation And Bylaws May Delay Or Prevent A Third Party Acquisition Of The Company, Which Could Decrease The Value Of Our Common Stock.\nAs described above, effective March 1, 2015, we reorganized to create a holding company structure and the new holding company is organized in the State of Delaware. Our new certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire it without the consent of its Board of Directors. These provisions will:\n\u25cf\nlimit the business at special meetings to the purpose stated in the notice of the meeting;\n\u25cf\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which is preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede a takeover attempt and that the Board of Directors can create and issue without prior stockholder approval;\n\u25cf\nestablish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the Board of Directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting;\n\u25cf\nrequire the affirmative vote of the \u201cdisinterested\u201d holders of a majority of our common stock to approve certain business combinations involving an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d or its affiliates, unless either minimum price criteria and procedural requirements are met, or the transaction is approved by a majority of our \u201ccontinuing directors\u201d (known as \u201cfair price provisions\u201d).\nAlthough we believe all of these provisions will make a higher third-party bid more likely by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with the Board of Directors, these provisions will apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and therefore could delay and/or prevent a deemed beneficial offer from being considered. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions, which may prevent a change of control or changes in our management that a stockholder might consider favorable. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of us. Any delay or prevention of a change of control or change in management that stockholders might otherwise consider to be favorable could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nIssues Or Concerns Related To The Quality And Safety Of Our Products, Ingredients Or Packaging Could Cause A Product Recall And/Or Result In Harm To The Company\u2019s Reputation, Negatively Impacting Our Results of Operations.\nIn order to sell our products, we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers and consumers. Issues related to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our Company\u2019s image and reputation. Negative publicity related to these types of concerns, or related to product contamination or product tampering, whether valid or not, could decrease demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. We may need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption. In addition, we could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions, which could result in payments of fines or damages. Costs associated with these potential actions could negatively affect our results of operations.\nDisruption To Our Manufacturing Operations Or Supply Chain Could Impair Our Ability To Produce Or Deliver Finished Products, Resulting In A Negative Impact On Our Results of Operations.\nAll of our manufacturing operations are located in Durango, Colorado. Disruption to our manufacturing operations or our supply chain could result from a number of factors. We believe that we take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions. We have strategies and plans in place to manage disruptive events if they were to occur. However, if we are unable, or find that it is not financially feasible, to effectively plan for or mitigate the potential impacts of such disruptive events on our manufacturing operations or supply chain, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nOur Financial Results May Be Adversely Impacted By The Failure To Successfully Execute Or Integrate Acquisitions, Divestitures And Joint Ventures.\nFrom time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives. The success of such activity depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable buyers, sellers or business partners; perform effective assessments prior to contract execution; negotiate contract terms; and, if applicable, obtain government approval. These activities may present certain financial, managerial, staffing and talent, and operational risks, including diversion of management\u2019s attention from existing core businesses; difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations; and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made. If the acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed, there could be a negative impact on our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 10044, "SIC": 2060, "TIC": "RMCF"}
