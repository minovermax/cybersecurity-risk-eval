{"cik": "77776", "company": "PHH CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Company\nWe may not be able to fully or successfully execute or implement our business strategies or achieve our objectives, including our initiatives to re-engineer and grow our mortgage business.\nWe intend to deploy up to $200 million of excess cash to re-engineer our operations and support infrastructure for a stand-alone mortgage business, and we intend to invest up to $150 million to fund select growth opportunities to enhance the scale and profitability and diversify our revenue streams of our mortgage production and servicing operations. We may not achieve our stated goals or our expected annualized operating benefits in connection with these efforts, which include but are not limited to, expense reductions, restructuring our private label business model, growing our origination volume and expanding our target market in our existing real-estate and private label client bases, and growing our mortgage subservicing portfolio. The successful deployment of capital and achievement of our goals is subject to both the risks affecting our business generally (including market, credit, operational, and legal and compliance risks) and the inherent difficulty associated with implementing our strategies and is dependent on the skills, experience and efforts of our management team and our success in negotiating with third parties.\nWe may be unable to fully or successfully execute or implement our strategic investments or objectives, in whole or in part, or within the projected timeframe, and, even if we are successful, there can be no assurances that we can implement these initiatives in a cost efficient manner or that these initiatives will have the impact that we intend on our business activities and results of operations. Changing business or market conditions could necessitate a change in our business and capital deployment strategy. Further, pursuing and completing these goals could divert management\u2019s attention towards and financial resources from the goals and operations of our existing business.\nIn addition, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, we have implemented a strategy to shift the mix of our servicing portfolio to a greater mix of subserviced loans. To execute this strategy, we have entered into agreements to sell a portion of our newly-created Mortgage servicing rights to third parties, where we will have continuing involvement as subservicer. We expect this strategy to have long-term benefits to our capital structure as we will require less capital to fund capitalized MSRs and related servicing advances. We also expect this strategy to, among other outcomes, result in lower Segment profit that is offset by a higher return on equity in the segment and cause a decline in our capitalized portfolio. This strategy may result in a lower replenishment of prepayments and amortization with newly originated servicing rights. Further, there is increased risk with respect to increasing our focus on subservicing relationships, as the terms of a substantial portion of our subservicing agreements allow the owners of the servicing to terminate the subservicing agreement without cause. If we were to have our subservicing agreements terminated on a material portion of our subservicing portfolio, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business is complex and heavily regulated, and the full impact of regulatory developments to our business remains uncertain. In addition, we are subject to litigation, regulatory investigations, inquiries and proceedings and we may incur fines, penalties, and increased costs that could negatively impact our future results of operations, liquidity and cash flows or damage our reputation.\nRegulatory Environment\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local government authorities and may be subject to various judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions on how we conduct our business. These laws, regulations and judicial and administrative decisions include those pertaining to: real estate settlement procedures; fair lending; fair credit reporting; truth in lending; compliance with federal and state disclosure and licensing requirements; the establishment of maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges; secured transactions; collection, foreclosure, repossession and claims-handling procedures; other trade practices and privacy regulations providing for the use and safeguarding of non-public personal financial information of borrowers and guidance on non-traditional mortgage loans issued by the federal financial regulatory agencies. In addition, by agreement with our private-label clients we are required to comply with additional requirements that our clients may be subject to through their regulators. Our failure to comply with applicable laws,\nrules or regulations could result in:\n\u00a1 loss of our approvals to engage in our origination and servicing businesses;\n\u00a1 government investigations and enforcement actions;\n\u00a1 litigation;\n\u00a1 required payments of fines, penalties, settlements or judgments;\n\u00a1 the termination of our private-label agreements; and/or\n\u00a1 inability to fund our business, or otherwise operate our business.\nAny of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are monitoring a number of recent and pending changes to laws and regulations and other financial reform legislation that are expected to impact our business. These developments include but are not limited to: (i) regulations from the Dodd-Frank Act; (ii) proposed changes to the infrastructures of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; and (iii) current rules proposed and adopted by the CFPB, including the implementation of changes to mortgage origination and settlement forms currently required under the Truth in Lending Act and Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 which require significant modifications and enhancements to our mortgage production processes and systems to be in effect by August 1, 2015. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and of pending legislation in the U.S. Congress may impact the operation and practices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and could reduce or eliminate the GSE\u2019s ability to issue mortgage-backed securities, which would materially and adversely affect our business and could require us to fundamentally change our business model since we sell substantially all of our loans pursuant to GSE-sponsored programs. The full impact of these developments may have on our business remains unclear; however, such developments could result in heightened federal regulation and oversight of our business activities, may result in limitations on our ability to pursue business strategies, increase our costs, result in increased litigation or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we conduct our business. Furthermore, if we are not able to make the changes to our mortgage production processes and systems required by the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act, our ability to originate loans would be severely decreased.\nInvestigations and Subpoenas\nThere has been a heightened focus of regulators on the practices of the mortgage industry, including investigations of lending practices, foreclosure practices, and loss mitigation practices, among other matters. We are currently subject to inquiries, requests for information, investigations, and subpoenas as a result of our mortgage origination and servicing practices, including inquiries and requests for information from and investigations by regulators and attorneys general of certain states, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the U.S. House of Representatives, and the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee. These inquiries are at varying procedural stages and there can be no assurances that additional claims will not be asserted against us as a result of these inquiries.\nIn addition, in October 2014 we received a document subpoena from the Office of the Inspector General of the Federal Housing Financing Agency (the \u201cFHFA\u201d) requesting production of certain documents related to, among other things, our origination, underwriting and quality control processes for loans sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. While the FHFA, as regulatory and conservator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, does not have regulatory authority over us or our subsidiaries, there can be no assurance that Fannie Mae and/or Freddie Mac will not assert additional claims as a result of this inquiry.\nExisting Matters\nWe are defendants in various legal proceedings; including private and civil litigation as well as government and regulatory claims. Existing matters that are pending resolution include, but are not limited to: (i) we have undergone a regulatory examination by a multistate coalition of certain mortgage banking regulators; (ii) we have been subjected to an administrative proceeding of the CFPB alleging our former reinsurance activities violated certain\nprovisions of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) and other laws, and the administrative law judge presiding over the proceeding has issued a recommended decision to the director of the CFPB, which has been appealed by us and the CFPB\u2019s enforcement counsel; and (iii) we are subject to pending private litigation alleging that our servicing practices around lender-placed insurance were not in compliance with applicable laws. These matters are at varying procedural stages and the resolution of any of these matters may result in adverse judgments, fines, penalties, injunctions and other relief against us, payments made in settlement arrangements, as well as monetary payments or other agreements and obligations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.\nIn 2014, we have increased our reserves for legal and regulatory contingencies to reflect our estimate of the probable losses with respect to these matters. There can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of our pending or threatened litigation, claims or assessments will not result in losses in excess of our recorded reserves. For more information regarding legal proceedings, see Note 14, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe profitability of our Mortgage Production segment has been adversely affected by the increased mix of fee-based closings originated under our existing private label client contracts. We are currently evaluating a number of alternatives to restructure these contracts to improve the economics of the underlying contractual relationships; however, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in these efforts.\nThrough our private label agreements, we earn contractually specified origination assistance fees from our financial institution clients for the performance of mortgage loan origination services. Starting in 2013, we have observed a significant increase in our origination mix of fee-based closings, which is driven by the retention of certain loans by our financial-institution clients. The increased mix of fee-based closings has adversely affected the profitability of our Mortgage Production segment as the revenue per loan on fee-based closings is generally lower than the revenue per loan on saleable closings. Despite our efforts to align our cost structure with the expected mortgage production environment, based on the current market conditions and expected volumes, margins and mix, these contracts will remain unprofitable on a fully allocated basis.\nWe are evaluating a number of alternatives to remedy the profitability of these arrangements. We are in varying stages of the negotiation process with each client. Although these negotiations have continued to progress, we are mindful that these are complex contracts, and we are attempting to introduce meaningfully different pricing and operating models. As a result, any such changes in the terms and scope of some of our Private Label relationships could have a significant impact on our re-engineering plans, our expected origination volumes and our profitability. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to amend or renew the contracts on more favorable economic terms, if at all, or that any new terms will have the impact that we intend. Any failures to implement changes that meet our objectives, or in a timely manner, if at all, could have material adverse effects on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The amount of losses and negative cash flows that we may realize under these arrangements cannot be readily estimated as it is dependent on the volume of fee-based business we will experience, which may be impacted by the decisions of our financial institution clients towards fee-based production, as well as general market factors (such as interest rate levels) that drive the volume of loan originations, both of which are outside of our control.\nWe are subject to inherent risks associated with the sale of our Fleet business, including risks associated with our liabilities under the related agreements, with our tax position, and with the separation of the Fleet business, and we could be exposed to losses or liabilities in the future in connection with the sale. These risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse impact on our business generally, including our client, employee, lender, vendor and counterparty relationships, as well as our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or financial position.\nThe sale of our Fleet business was completed in 2014, and in connection with the sale, we have agreed to indemnify Element Financial Corporation (\u201cElement\u201d) for a breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty or covenant made by us in the purchase agreement, for any liability of ours that is not being assumed, for any claims by our stockholders against Element and for certain additional customary contingencies related to the sale agreement. Significant indemnification claims by Element could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn connection with tax amounts recorded related to the sale of the Fleet business, we assumed certain tax positions that, if not withheld under audit, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the payment of additional tax amounts, penalties and interest, or other negative consequences.\nThe activities involved in separating our fleet and mortgage businesses, including those required under a transition services agreement with Element, may cause the diversion of a significant amount of management time and attention away from the daily operation of our business and the execution of our business plan, and may also have an adverse impact on our business generally, including adverse impacts on our client, employee, lender, vendor and counterparty relationships. Further, we face risks related to our ability to successfully transition the performance of certain processes, including but not limited to, accounting, information technology, risk management and finance and the related internal and operational controls during the transition period.\nWe are substantially dependent upon our mortgage warehouse facilities and our servicing advance facility, a significant portion of which are short-term agreements. If any of our funding arrangements are terminated, not renewed or otherwise become unavailable to us, we may be unable to find replacement financing on economically viable terms, if at all, which would adversely affect our ability to fund our operations.\nWe are substantially dependent upon our mortgage warehouse funding arrangements, a significant portion of which are short-term in nature. Our access to and our ability to renew our existing mortgage warehouse facilities is subject to prevailing market conditions, and could suffer in the event of: (i) the deterioration in the performance of the mortgage loans underlying the warehouse facilities; (ii) our failure to maintain sufficient levels of eligible assets or credit enhancements; (iii) our inability to access the secondary market for mortgage loans; or (iv) termination of our role as servicer of the underlying mortgage assets in the event that (a) we default in the performance of our servicing obligations or (b) we declare bankruptcy or become insolvent.\nWe are also dependent on our servicing advance funding facility, PHH Servicer Advance Receivables Trust (\u201cPSART\u201d), which is a special purpose bankruptcy remote trust formed in 2014 for purposes of issuing non-recourse asset-backed notes secured by servicing advance receivables. We have received notice from the committed purchaser of PSART that the counterparty\u2019s current intention is to exit the mortgage financing business, and therefore they will not renew the revolving period of the facility upon expiration on March 31, 2015. After the revolving period, the facility will go into amortization, and thereafter we are required to repay the outstanding balance through advance collections or additional payments, on or before the maturity date of April 17, 2017. In February 2015, we received an extension of the revolving period through May 29, 2015, with a final maturity date of June 15, 2017. We are exploring alternatives for funding advances upon expiration of the revolving period of the facility. Our ability to maintain liquidity through issuing asset-backed notes secured by servicing advance receivables is dependent on many factors, including but not limited to: (i) market demand for ABS, specifically ABS collateralized by mortgage receivables; (ii) our ability to service in accordance with applicable guidelines and the quality of our servicing, both of which will impact noteholders\u2019 willingness to commit to financing for an additional term; and (iii) our ability to negotiate terms acceptable to us.\nCertain of our debt arrangements require us to comply with specific financial covenants and other affirmative and restrictive covenants. An uncured default of one or more of these covenants could result in a cross-default between and amongst our various debt arrangements, including our unsecured term debt. Consequently, an uncured default under any of our debt arrangements that is not waived by our lenders and that results in an acceleration of amounts payable to our lenders or the termination of credit facilities would materially and adversely impact our liquidity, could force us to sell assets at below market prices to repay our indebtedness, and could force us to seek relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nIf any of our facilities are terminated or are not renewed, we may be unable to find replacement financing on commercially favorable terms, if at all, which could adversely impact our operations and prevent us from executing our business plan and related risk management strategies, originating new mortgage loans or fulfilling commitments made in the ordinary course of business. These factors could reduce revenues attributable to our business activities or require us to sell assets at below market prices, either of which would have a material adverse effect on our overall business and consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Most of our mortgage warehouse facilities mature within one year and generally, these facilities require us to maintain a specified amount of available liquidity from other facilities. As such, our liquidity profile and compliance with debt covenants depends on our ability to renew multiple facilities within a short time frame and our failure to do so could materially adversely impact our overall business and financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be limited in our ability to obtain or renew financing on economically viable terms or at all, due to our senior unsecured long-term debt ratings being below investment grade and due to a lack of history of operating as a stand-alone mortgage business.\nOur senior unsecured long-term debt ratings are below investment grade and, as a result, our access to the public debt markets may be severely limited in comparison to the ability of investment grade issuers to access such markets. In addition, our historical results of operations have included the operations of the Fleet Management Services segment, which has represented a less significant portion of our Net income or loss, yet was a consistent, source of income and cash flows for our business. After the completion of the sale, our access to the public debt markets, and our ability to obtain unsecured revolving credit borrowing capacity, may be more limited than our historical experience, or we may be unable to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. We may be required to rely on alternative financing, such as bank lines and private debt placements, and may also be required to pledge otherwise unencumbered assets. Furthermore, our cost of financing could rise significantly, thereby negatively impacting our ability to finance our mortgage loans held for sale, mortgage servicing rights and servicing advance receivables. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur ratings were downgraded in July 2014 after the completion of the sale of the Fleet business and we may be subject to further actions: (i) if our business and financial results deteriorate significantly or do not show improvement over an acceptable period of time; (ii) if we are unable to put in place sources of liquidity to fund our business satisfactory to the rating agencies; (iii) based upon regulatory reviews, investigations, proceedings or other claims and enforcement actions that result in material monetary exposures and/or other negative consequences, among other factors. We cannot predict the impact any further negative debt ratings actions may have on our cost of capital, ability to incur new indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness or ability to retain or secure customers.\nWe are highly dependent upon programs administered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae.\nOur ability to generate revenues in our Mortgage Production and Servicing segments is highly dependent on programs administered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae that facilitate the issuance of mortgage-backed securities in the secondary market. These entities play a powerful role in the residential mortgage industry, and we have significant business relationships with them, including:\nProduction. During 2014, 69% of our mortgage loan sales were sold to, or were sold pursuant to programs sponsored by, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. We also derive other material financial benefits from our relationships with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, including the assumption of credit risk by these entities on loans included in mortgage-backed securities in exchange for our payment of guarantee fees, the ability to avoid certain loan inventory finance costs through streamlined loan funding and sale procedures and the use of mortgage warehouse facilities with Fannie Mae pursuant to which, as of December 31, 2014, we had total capacity of $3.0 billion, made up of $500 million of committed and $2.5 billion uncommitted capacity.\nServicing. We service loans on behalf of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as loans that have been securitized pursuant to securitization programs sponsored by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. A majority of our mortgage servicing rights and loans serviced through subservicing agreements relate to these servicing activities. These entities establish the base service fee to compensate us for servicing loans as well as the assessment of fines and penalties that may be imposed upon us for failing to meet servicing standards.\nOur status as a Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae approved seller/servicer is subject to compliance with each entity\u2019s respective selling and servicing guidelines and failure to meet such guidelines could result in the unilateral termination of our status as an approved seller/servicer. Failure to maintain our relationship with each of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae would materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurther, changes in existing U.S. government-sponsored mortgage programs or servicing eligibility standards could require us to fundamentally change our business model in order to effectively compete in the market. Congress has held hearings and received reports outlining the long-term strategic plan for, and various options for long-term reform of the U.S. housing finance market, including changes designed to reduce government support for housing finance and the winding down of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae over a period of years. Legislation, if enacted, or further regulation which curtails Freddie Mac and/or Fannie Mae\u2019s activities and/or results in the wind down of these entities could impact the pricing of mortgage related assets in the secondary market, result in higher mortgage rates to borrowers, and have a resulting negative impact on mortgage origination volumes and margins across the mortgage industry, any one of which could have a negative impact on our Mortgage production business. There is currently uncertainty with respect to the extent, if any, of such reform, and the long-term or short-term impacts of such changes on the housing market, and the related impacts on our operations.\nThe private label originations of our Mortgage Production segment are substantially dependent upon a small number of client relationships, including those with Merrill Lynch Home Loans, a division of Bank of America, National Association, Morgan Stanley Private Bank, N.A. and HSBC Bank USA. The termination or non-renewal of our contractual agreements with certain of these clients would materially and adversely impact our mortgage loan originations and resulting Net revenues and Segment profit of our Mortgage Production segment, as well as our overall business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur private label business channel is substantially dependent upon a small number of client relationships, and accounts for 72% of our total closings for the year ended December 31, 2014. In particular, 24% of our total closings for the year ended December 31, 2014 were derived from Merrill Lynch Home Loans, a division of Bank of America, National Association, 21% from Morgan Stanley Private Bank, N.A. and 10% from HSBC Bank USA.\nOur agreement with Merrill Lynch Home Loans is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2015 and there can be no assurances that the agreement will be renewed on favorable terms, if at all. We are currently in discussions with Merrill Lynch Home Loans about the future structure of this relationship, including our involvement in their mortgage origination services. The non-renewal of this arrangement would negatively impact our mortgage loan originations volume, and would adversely impact our Net revenues and Segment profit of our Mortgage Production segment, as well as our overall business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurther, the loss or non-renewal of certain of our other private label client agreements, including Morgan Stanley which is scheduled to expire on October 31, 2016 and HSBC which is scheduled to expire on March 30, 2018, whether due to insolvency, their unwillingness or inability to perform their obligations under their respective contractual relationships with us, their termination of their respective contractual relationships with us due to our failure to fully satisfy our contractual obligations, or if we are not able to renew on commercially reasonable terms any of their respective contractual relationships with us, may materially and adversely impact our mortgage loan originations and resulting Net revenues and Segment profit of our Mortgage Production segment as well as our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Mortgage Production segment is substantially dependent upon our relationship with Realogy, and the termination or non-renewal of our contractual agreements with Realogy would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRelationship with Realogy. We are party to a Strategic Relationship Agreement dated as of January 31, 2005 between PHH Mortgage, PHH Home Loans, PHH Broker Partner, Realogy Services Venture Partner Inc. and Cendant Corporation (now known as Avis Budget Group, Inc.). Under the Strategic Relationship Agreement we are the exclusive recommended provider of mortgage loans to the independent sales associates affiliated with the real estate brokerage business owned and operated by Realogy\u2019s affiliates and certain customers of Realogy. Similarly, PHH Mortgage is party to a marketing agreement with Realogy\u2019s real estate brokerage franchises (Coldwell Banker Real Estate Corporation, Century 21 Real Estate LLC, ERA Franchise Systems, Inc., and Sotheby\u2019s International Affiliates, Inc.) which provides that we are the exclusive recommended provider of mortgage loans and related products to the independent sales associates of these franchises. PHH Home Loans is a joint venture that was formed for the purpose of originating and selling mortgage loans primarily sourced through Realogy\u2019s owned real estate brokerage business. The operations of PHH Home Loans are governed by the PHH Home Loans Operating Agreement.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, 24% of our mortgage loan originations were derived from Realogy Corporation\u2019s affiliates, of which 88% were originated by PHH Home Loans. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2014, PHH Home Loans originated residential mortgage loans of $7.0 billion and PHH Home Loans brokered or sold $3.3 billion of mortgage loans to PHH Mortgage under the terms of a loan purchase arrangement.\nContractual Agreements. Unless terminated earlier, our relationship with Realogy continues until January 31, 2055. However, under the PHH Home Loans Operating Agreement, beginning on February 1, 2015, Realogy has the right at any time to give us two years notice of their intent to terminate their interest in PHH Home Loans. In addition, the Strategic Relationship Agreement and the PHH Home Loans Operating Agreement outline certain terms and events that would give Realogy the right to terminate the PHH Home Loans joint venture for cause. These terms and events include, but are not limited to, if:\n\u00b7 we materially breach any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the Strategic Relationship Agreement, the Marketing Agreement, Trademark License agreements or certain other related agreements, including, without limitation to, our confidentiality agreements in the PHH Home Loans Operating Agreement and the Strategic Relationship Agreement, and our non-competition agreements in the Strategic Relationship Agreement that is not cured following any applicable notice or cure period;\n\u00b7 we become subject to any regulatory order or governmental proceeding that prevents or materially impairs PHH Home Loans\u2019 ability to originate mortgage loans for any period of time (which order or proceeding is not generally applicable to companies in the mortgage lending business) in a manner that adversely affects the value of one or more of the quarterly distributions to be paid by PHH Home Loans pursuant to the PHH Home Loans Operating Agreement;\n\u00b7 PHH Home Loans fails to make scheduled distributions pursuant to the PHH Home Loans Operating Agreement; or\n\u00b7 there is a change in control of us, PHH Broker Partner Corporation or any other affiliate of ours involving certain competitors or other specified parties.\nUpon a termination of the PHH Home Loans joint venture by Realogy or its affiliates (whether for cause or upon two years\u2019 notice without cause), Realogy will have the right either: (i) to require that we or certain of our affiliates purchase all of Realogy\u2019s interest in PHH Home Loans at the applicable purchase price set forth in the PHH Home Loans Operating Agreement; or (ii) to cause us to sell our interest in PHH Home Loans at the applicable sale price set forth in the PHH Home Loans Operating Agreement to an unaffiliated third party designated by certain of Realogy\u2019s affiliates. If we were required to purchase Realogy\u2019s interest in PHH Home Loans, such purchase could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity. Additionally, any termination of the PHH Home Loans joint venture will also result in a termination of the Strategic Relationship Agreement, including our exclusivity rights thereunder and our other agreements and arrangements with Realogy. Any such termination would likely result in the loss of most, if not all, of our mortgage loan originations and Net revenues derived from Realogy\u2019s affiliates, which would have a material adverse effect on our overall business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nCertain hedging strategies that we may use to manage risks associated with our assets, including mortgage loans held for sale, interest rate lock commitments, and mortgage servicing rights, may not be effective in mitigating those risks and could result in substantial losses that could exceed the losses that would have been incurred had we not used such hedging strategies.\nWe may employ various economic hedging strategies in an attempt to mitigate the interest rate and prepayment risk inherent in many of our assets, including our mortgage loans held for sale, interest rate lock commitments and our mortgage servicing rights. Our hedging activities may include entering into derivative instruments. We also seek to manage interest rate risk in our Mortgage Production and Mortgage Servicing segments partially without the use of financial derivatives by monitoring and seeking to maintain an appropriate balance between our loan production volume and the size of our capitalized portfolio associated with mortgage servicing rights, as the value of mortgage servicing rights and the income they provide tend to be counter-cyclical to the changes in production volumes and the gain or loss on loans that result from changes in interest rates. This approach requires our management to make assumptions with regards to future replenishment rates for our mortgage servicing rights, loan margins, the value of additions to our mortgage servicing rights and loan origination costs, and many factors can impact these estimates,\nincluding loan pricing margins and our ability to adjust staffing levels to meet changing consumer demand. Our decisions regarding the levels, if any, of our derivatives related to mortgage servicing rights could result in continued volatility in the results of operations for our Mortgage Servicing segment.\nOur hedging strategies, including our decisions whether to use derivative instruments to hedge our Mortgage servicing rights, may not be effective in mitigating the risks related to changes in interest rates and we may not have sufficient liquidity to exercise our strategies. Poorly designed strategies or improperly executed transactions could actually increase our risk and losses, and could result in losses in excess of what our losses would have been had we not used such hedging strategies. There have been periods, and it is likely that there will be periods in the future, during which we incur significant losses as a result of our hedging strategies. As stated earlier, the success of our interest rate risk management strategy and our replenishment strategies for our mortgage servicing rights are largely dependent on our ability to predict the earnings sensitivity of our loan servicing and loan production activities in various interest rate environments, as well as our ability to successfully manage any capacity constraints in our mortgage production business and our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity to exercise these strategies. Our hedging strategies also rely on assumptions and projections regarding our assets and general market factors. If these assumptions and projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes including, but not limited to, interest rates or prepayment speeds, we may incur losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nChanges in interest rates could materially and adversely affect our volume of mortgage loan originations or reduce the value of our mortgage servicing rights, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.\nChanges in and the level of interest rates are key drivers of our mortgage loan originations in our Mortgage Production segment and mortgage loan refinancing activity, in particular. The level of interest rates are significantly affected by monetary and related policies of the federal government, its agencies and government sponsored entities, which are particularly affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve Board that regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. The Federal Reserve Board\u2019s policies, including initiatives to stabilize the U.S. housing market and to stimulate overall economic growth, affect the size of the mortgage loan origination market, the pricing of our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in any of these policies are beyond our control, difficult to predict, particularly in the current economic environment, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.\nHistorically, rising interest rates have generally been associated with a lower volume of loan originations and lower pricing margins in our Mortgage Production segment due to a disincentive for borrowers to refinance at a higher interest rate, while falling interest rates have generally been associated with higher loan originations and higher pricing margins, due to an incentive for borrowers to refinance at a lower interest rate. Our ability to generate Gain on loans held for sale, net in our Mortgage Production segment is significantly dependent on our level of saleable mortgage loan originations. Accordingly, increases in interest rates could materially and adversely affect our mortgage loan origination volume, which could have a material and adverse effect on our Mortgage Production segment, as well as our overall business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows. In addition, changes in interest rates may require us to post additional collateral under certain of our financing arrangements and derivative agreements which could impact our liquidity.\nChanges in interest rates are also a key driver of the performance of our Mortgage Servicing segment as the values of our mortgage servicing rights are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates. Historically, the value of our mortgage servicing rights have increased when interest rates rise and have decreased when interest rates decline due to the effect those changes in interest rates have on prepayment estimates, with changes in fair value of our mortgage servicing rights being included in our consolidated results of operations. Our consolidated financial positions, results of operations and cash flows are susceptible to significant volatility due to changes in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights as interest rates change. As a result, substantial volatility in interest rates materially affects our Mortgage Servicing segment, as well as our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive and many of our competitors have access to greater financial resources, lower funding costs and greater access to liquidity, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of economic, legislative, regulatory or technological changes. Competition for mortgage loan originations comes primarily from commercial banks and savings institutions, as well as non-bank mortgage originators. Many of our competitors for mortgage loan originations that are commercial banks or savings institutions typically have access to greater financial resources, have lower funding costs, are less reliant than we are on the sale of mortgage loans into the secondary markets to maintain their liquidity, and may be able to participate in government programs that we are unable to participate in because we are not a state or federally chartered depository institution, all of which places us at a competitive disadvantage. Further, since we are not a state or federally chartered depository institution, we must comply with the licensing and regulatory requirements of states and other jurisdictions, we may incur increased compliance costs, and we are subject to increased compliance and regulatory risks than many of our competitors.\nOther advantages of our largest competitors include, but are not limited to, their ability to hold new mortgage loan originations in an investment portfolio and their access to lower rate bank deposits as a source of liquidity. Additionally, more restrictive loan underwriting standards and the widespread elimination of certain non-conforming mortgage products throughout the industry have resulted in a more homogenous product offering, which has increased competition across the industry for mortgage originations.\nOur financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates made by our management, including those used in determining the fair values of a substantial portion of our assets. If the assumptions or estimates are subsequently proven incorrect or inaccurate, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nPursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we utilize certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including but not limited to, when determining the fair values of certain assets and liabilities, reserves related to litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, and reserves related to mortgage representations and warranty claims. If the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience significant losses as the ultimate realization of value may be materially different than the amounts reflected in our consolidated statement of financial position as of any particular date.\nFor additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing our financial statements, see \u201cPart II-Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d in this Form 10K.\nFair Value. A substantial portion of our assets are recorded at fair value based upon significant estimates and assumptions with changes in fair value included in our consolidated results of operations. As of December 31, 2014, 45% of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including $1.0 billion of assets representing our Mortgage servicing rights which are valued using significant unobservable inputs and management\u2019s judgment of the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset. The determination of the fair value of our assets involves numerous estimates and assumptions made by our management. Such estimates and assumptions include, without limitation, estimates of future cash flows associated with our mortgage servicing rights based upon model inputs involving interest rates as well as the prepayment rates and delinquencies and foreclosure rates of the underlying serviced mortgage loans. The use of different estimates or assumptions in connection with the valuation of these assets could produce materially different fair values, or our fair value estimates may not be realized in an actual sale or settlement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nReserves and Contingencies. Reserves are established for pending or threatened litigation, claims or assessments when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. In light of the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation and other legal proceedings, it is not always possible to determine a reasonable estimate of the amount of a probable loss, and we may estimate a range of possible loss for consideration in these estimates. The estimates are based upon currently available information and involve significant judgment taking into account the varying stages and inherent uncertainties of such matters. Accordingly, our estimates may change from time to time and such changes may be material to our consolidated results of\noperations, and the ultimate settlement of such matters may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nRepresentations and Warranties. In connection with the sale of mortgage loans, we make various representations and warranties that, if breached, require us to repurchase the loans or indemnify the purchaser for actual losses incurred in respect of such loans. The estimation of our loan repurchase and indemnification liability requires subjective and complex judgments, and incorporates key assumptions that are impacted by both internal and external factors. Internal factors include, but are not limited to, the level of loan sales and origination volumes, and the quality of our underwriting procedures. External factors include, but are not limited to: (i) the political environment and oversight of the Agencies, and related changes in Agency programs and guidelines, (ii) borrower delinquency levels and default patterns, (iii) home price values and (iv) the overall economic condition of borrowers and the U.S. economy.\nFurther, a significant amount of our exposure to representation and warranty claims relates to loans that are subject to a new representation framework for conventional loans. The full impact of our future loss experience under the new framework remains uncertain, and we will continue to refine our loss estimates as we monitor our experience with file reviews and claims under the new framework.\nOur reliance on outsourcing arrangements for information technology services subjects us to significant business process and control risks due to the complexity of our information systems, any failures in our ability to manage or transition services under the arrangement, or if our outsourcing counterparties do not meet their obligations to us.\nWe entered into an arrangement to outsource our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) services to a third party as part of an effort to reduce costs and obtain operational benefits. Entering into an outsourcing arrangement for IT services subjects us to significant business process and control risks. If our outsource partner fails to perform their obligations under the terms of the agreement, or if our transition and management of this vendor is not successful, we are subject to operational risk from our IT environment. We are heavily dependent on the strength and capability of our technology systems which we use both to interface with our customers and to manage our internal financial and other systems. Our business model and our reputation as a service provider to our clients, as well as our internal controls over financial reporting, are highly dependent upon these systems and processes. In addition, our ability to run our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations is dependent on our technology infrastructure.\nAlthough we have service-level arrangements with our counterparties, we do not ultimately control their performance, which may make our operations vulnerable to their performance failures. Any failures in our technology systems, processes or the related internal and operational controls, or the failure of our outsourcing providers to perform as expected or as contractually required could result in the loss of client relationships, damage to our reputation, failures to comply with regulations, failure to prepare our financial statements in a timely and accurate manner, and increased costs, the result of any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nA failure in or breach of our technology infrastructure or information protection programs, or those of our outsource providers, could result in the inadvertent disclosure of the confidential personal information of our customers, as well as the confidential personal information of the customers of our clients. Any such failure or breach, including as a result of cyber-attacks against us or our outsource partners, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nOur business model and our reputation as a service provider to our clients are dependent upon our ability to safeguard the confidential personal information of our customers, as well as the confidential personal information of the customers of our clients. Although we have put in place, and require our outsource providers to follow, a comprehensive information security program that we monitor and update as needed, security breaches could occur through intentional or unintentional acts by individuals having authorized or unauthorized access to confidential information of our customers or the employees or customers of our clients which could potentially compromise confidential information processed and stored in or transmitted through our technology infrastructure. In addition, we have highly complex information systems, certain portions of which we are dependent upon third party outsource providers and other portions of which are self-developed and for which third party support is not generally available.\nA failure in or breach of the security of our information systems, or those of our outsource providers, or a cyber-attack against us or our outsource partners, could result in significant damage to our reputation or the reputation of our clients, could negatively impact our ability to attract or retain clients and could result in increased costs attributable to related litigation or regulatory actions, claims for indemnification, higher insurance premiums and remediation activities, the result of any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur existing Convertible note series, any future issuances of securities convertible into our Common stock and hedging activities may result in dilution of our stockholders or depress the trading price of our Common stock.\nThe voting power and ownership percentage of our stockholders will be diluted and the trading price of our Common stock could be substantially decreased if we issue any shares of our Common stock or securities convertible into our Common stock in the future, including the issuance of shares of Common stock upon conversion of any existing convertible notes or the issuance of shares of Common stock upon exercise or settlement of any outstanding share-based payment awards granted under our equity and incentive plans. In addition, the price of our Common stock could also be negatively affected by possible sales of our Common stock by investors who engage in hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our Common stock following the issuance of the convertible notes.\nWe did not enter into a hedge transaction associated with the issuance of our Convertible notes due 2017. Upon conversion of the Convertible notes due 2017, the principal amount is payable in cash and to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the converted notes we are required to pay or deliver (at our election) (i) cash; (ii) shares of our Common stock; or (iii) a combination of cash and shares of Common stock. The increase in, and any further increases in, the trading price of our Common stock since the issuance of those notes, will result in a required cash payment upon conversion of the notes or will result in a dilution of the voting power and ownership percentage of the Common stock held by our existing shareholders, either of which may negatively affect the trading price of our Common stock. As of December 31, 2014, the Convertible notes due 2017 are eligible for conversion, and if all such notes were converted as of such date, we would be required to settle the note principal plus a premium of $214 million cash, 8.932 million shares of our Common stock, or a combination thereof (at our election). A 10% increase in our stock price from the closing price of December 31, 2014, results in an increase in the required conversion premium of $46 million, or 0.930 million shares.\nWe also may issue shares of our Common stock or securities convertible into our Common stock in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy (including in connection with acquisitions, strategic collaborations or other transactions), to increase our capital, to adjust our ratio of debt to equity, to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options or for other reasons. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Common stock or securities convertible into our Common stock or the effect, if any, that such future issuances might have to dilute the voting interests of our stockholders or otherwise on the market price for our Common stock.\nOur share repurchase programs may affect the market for our common stock, including affecting our share price or increasing share price volatility.\nOn June 26, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized up to $450 million in share repurchases, including $200 million of accelerated share repurchases (\u201cASR\u201d) and up to $250 million in open market purchases over the twelve months following the completion of the ASR. The authorization requires that these programs expire no later than March 31, 2016. Repurchases of our common stock pursuant to these programs could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of share repurchase programs could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such programs. Our share repurchase programs will utilize cash that we will not be able to use in other ways to grow our business.\nIn the third quarter of 2014 we entered into an aggregate of $200 million of ASR programs and have retired approximately 6.963 million of our common shares under the programs to-date. The final settlement of shares repurchased from these programs will be determined at the completions of the programs, which is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2015. Our counterparty to the ASR programs may complete various market transactions for\nits\u2019 own account to fulfill the programs, including purchasing shares of our Common stock in the open market or entering into derivative transactions with respect to our Common stock, and such actions may affect our stock price and increase its\u2019 volatility.\nAlthough the Board of Directors has authorized an additional $250 million in share repurchases, we are not obligated to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, the trading price of our common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities. The repurchase program may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice.\nA change in control transaction or a fundamental change in our business may result in a number of significant cash outflows that could reduce the value of our business. Further, certain provisions of our debt arrangements and the provisions of certain other agreements could discourage third parties from seeking to acquire us, could prevent or delay a transaction resulting in a change of control.\nThe net proceeds realized by our shareholders as the result of any change in control transaction or a fundamental change, may be negatively impacted as a result of required payments under our corporate term debt certain tax impacts or the potential termination of certain client relationships (if consents or waivers are not obtained), among other consequences.\nThe terms of certain of our Senior note and Convertible note debt agreements and indentures contain provisions that require us to offer to repurchase, for cash, all or a portion of the outstanding notes upon a change of control or fundamental change, as defined in such indentures. Further, a change of control or fundamental change may constitute an event of default under certain of our debt agreements, including our mortgage warehouse facilities. In addition, in the event of a make-whole fundamental change (as defined by the indentures governing our Convertible notes due 2017), the conversion rate for the notes may, in some cases, be increased for a holder that elects to convert their notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change.\nWe may need to obtain consents or waivers from the GSEs, state licensing agencies and certain clients or counterparties, in connection with certain change in control transactions. Additionally, the value of our Mortgage business could be reduced from any lost relationships and/or loss of our approved status as a Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae approved seller/servicer in connection with certain change in control transactions. Our agreements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac require us to provide notice or obtain approvals or consents related to any change in control transaction. Our agreements with Realogy, including the PHH Home Loans Operating Agreement, state that Realogy may terminate PHH Home Loans if we effect a change in control transaction involving certain competitors or other third parties. In connection with such termination, we may be required to make a cash payment to Realogy in an amount equal to: (i) PHH Home Loans\u2019 trailing 12 months net income multiplied by the greater of (a) the number of years remaining in the first 12 years of the term of the agreement or (b) two years.\nIn addition, agreements with some of our financial institution clients governing our private-label relationships provide our clients with the right to terminate their relationship with us if we complete certain change in control transactions with certain third parties. The need to obtain waivers or consents from our clients in connection with a change in control transactions may discourage certain third parties from seeking to acquire us or could reduce the amount of consideration they would be willing to pay to our stockholders in an acquisition transaction, or could otherwise reduce the value of the business when separated.\nProvisions in our charter documents, the Maryland General Corporation Law, and New York insurance law may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party.\nOur charter and by-laws contain several provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions include, among other things, advance notice for raising business or making nominations at meetings and \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock. Blank check preferred stock enables our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to designate and issue additional series of preferred stock with such dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights, including the right to issue convertible securities with no limitations on conversion, as our board of directors may determine, including rights to dividends and proceeds in a liquidation that are senior to the Common stock.\nWe are also subject to certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law which could delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for their Common stock or may otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. These include, among other provisions:\n\u00a7 the \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d statute which prohibits transactions between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder and\n\u00a7 the \u201ccontrol share\u201d acquisition statute which provides that control shares of a Maryland corporation acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.\nOur by-laws contain a provision exempting any share of our capital stock from the control share acquisition statute to the fullest extent permitted by the Maryland General Corporation Law. However, our Board of Directors has the exclusive right to amend our by-laws and, subject to their fiduciary duties, and could at any time in the future amend the by-laws to remove this exemption provision.\nIn addition, we are registered as an insurance holding company in the state of New York as a result of our wholly owned subsidiary, Atrium Insurance Corporation. New York insurance law requires regulatory approval of a change in control of an insurer or an insurer\u2019s holding company. Accordingly, there can be no effective change in control of us unless the person seeking to acquire control has filed a statement containing specified information with the New York state insurance regulators and has obtained prior approval. The measure for a presumptive change of control pursuant to New York law is the acquisition of 10% or more of the voting stock or other ownership interest of an insurance company or its parent. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change in control of us, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable.", "PERMNO": 90531, "SIC": 6162, "TIC": "PHH"}
