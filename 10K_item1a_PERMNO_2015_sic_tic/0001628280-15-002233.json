RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected by known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. We have summarized below the significant, known material risks to our business. Additional risk factors not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Any of these risks, uncertainties and other factors could cause our future financial results to differ materially from recent financial results or from currently anticipated future financial results. The risk factors below should be considered together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201cForm 10-K\u201d) as well as other required filings by us to the SEC.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE\nOur indebtedness could limit our financing options, adversely affect our financial condition, and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had approximately $290.0 million of outstanding long-term debt, consisting primarily of $200.0 million of senior unsecured notes (the \u201cNotes\u201d) and approximately $90.0 million under our senior secured term loan (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d). As as a result, we currently have a relatively higher level of indebtedness than industry participants. The debt was the direct result of our LaBarge Acquisition.\nIn 2012, we began steps to reduce our debt by making approximately $25.0 million of voluntary principal prepayments on the Term Loan. In 2013, we paid an additional approximately $30.0 million of voluntary principal prepayments on our Term Loan. In 2014, we paid another approximately $42.6 million of additional voluntary principal prepayments. We believe that these prepayments will help facilitate our plans to refinance in 2015. Our ability to complete a debt refinancing in 2015 may be limited, as discussed below in this risk factor. We may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as selling assets; reducing or delaying scheduled expansions and/or capital investments; or seeking various forms of capital. Our ability to complete alternative financing plans may be affected by circumstances and economic events outside of our control. We cannot ensure that we would be able to refinance our debt or enter into alternative financing plans in adequate amounts on commercially reasonable terms, terms acceptable to us or at all, or that such plans guarantee that we would be able to meet our debt obligations.\nOur high level of debt could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nrequire a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors;\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of increased borrowing costs and higher interest rates as borrowings under our Credit Facilities bear interest at variable rates, which could further adversely impact our cash flows;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to plan for and react to changes in our business and the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nexpose us to risk of rating agency downgrades and unfavorable changes in the global credit markets;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt and maintain financial ratios as discussed below; and\n\u2022\nprevent us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase all Notes tendered to us upon the occurrence of certain changes of control, which failure to repurchase would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing the Notes.\nThe occurrence of any one of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to satisfy our obligations in respect of our outstanding debt.\nWe require a considerable amount of cash to service our indebtedness.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and working capital needs, will depend upon our ability to generate significant cash in the future. Our ability to generate cash is subject to economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that may be beyond our control.\nThe $200.0 million Notes bear interest of 9.75% per annum, payable semi-annually. At December 31, 2014, the outstanding balance on the Term Loan was approximately $90.0 million with an interest rate of 4.75%, consisting of a London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) interest rate floor of 1.00%, plus a margin of 3.75%, with interest paid quarterly. In 2013, we successfully repriced our Term Loan by 0.75%, resulting in the current lower rate. Should interest rates increase above the interest rate floor of 1.00%, our debt service cost will increase. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWhile we expect to meet all of our financial obligations, we cannot ensure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. In conjunction with the issuance of the Term Loan in 2011, we obtained a $60.0 million Revolving Credit Facility (\u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d), (collectively the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d). We cannot ensure that future borrowings will be available under the Revolving Credit Facility, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or fund our other liquidity needs, if at all.\nWe require a considerable amount of cash to fund our anticipated voluntary principal prepayments on our Term Loan.\nOur ability to continue to reduce our Term Loan through voluntary principal prepayments will be a contributing factor to our ability to refinance our debt in 2015. Our ability to make such prepayments will depend upon our ability to generate significant cash in the future. We cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund any such prepayments.\nThe covenants in the credit agreement to our Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Notes impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility and may limit our ability to make payments on the Notes.\nIn the event that a certain minimum amount is borrowed and outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility, for so long as any such amount is outstanding, we will be required to comply with a leverage covenant, as defined in the credit agreement. Furthermore, our consolidated earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d), as defined by the credit agreement to our Credit Facilities, as of the end of any fiscal quarter on a trailing four-quarter basis, is not permitted to be less than $50.0 million. The leverage covenant decreases over the term of the Revolving Credit Facility, which will require us to generate either increasing cash flows or increasing EBITDA in the future. For example, in October 2013, we completed an amendment to the credit agreement to our Credit Facilities which partially mitigated the impact of the leverage covenant by increasing the leverage ratio by 0.75 for all future periods. We believe the voluntary prepayments on the Term Loan will help reduce our leverage, as defined in the credit agreement.\nAt December 31, 2014, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility which would have required us to comply with the leverage covenant. However, we would have been in compliance with such leverage covenant. At December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with the EBITDA covenant. There is no assurance that we will continue to be in compliance with the leverage covenant or the EBITDA covenant in future periods.\nOur credit agreement to the Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability, among other things, to incur additional indebtedness, to create liens, to make certain payments, investments and capital expenditures, to pay dividends, to engage in transactions with affiliates, to sell certain assets or enter into mergers.\nThese covenants could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs. Furthermore, they may restrict our ability to expand, pursue our business strategies and otherwise conduct our business. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by circumstances and events beyond our control, such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations, and we cannot ensure that we will be able to comply with such covenants. These restrictions also limit our ability to obtain future financings to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of the Notes and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nA breach of any covenant in credit agreement to the Credit Facilities or the agreements and indentures governing any other indebtedness that we may have outstanding from time to time, including the indenture governing the Notes, would result in a default under that agreement or indenture after any applicable grace periods. A default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the debt outstanding under the agreement and in a default with respect to, and an acceleration of, the debt outstanding under other debt agreements. If that occurs, we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow\nsufficient funds to refinance such debt. A default could permit our lenders to foreclose on any of our assets securing such debt. Even if new financing were available at that time, it may not be on terms or amounts that are acceptable to us or terms as favorable as our current agreements. If our debt is in default for any reason, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to make the change of control offer required by the indenture governing the Notes.\nWe may be unable to purchase the Notes upon a change of control, as defined in the indenture governing the Notes. Upon a change of control, we will be required to offer to purchase all of the Notes then outstanding for cash at 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the date of purchase on the Notes. If a change of control were to occur, we may not have sufficient funds to pay the change of control purchase price and we may be required to secure third-party financing to do so. However, we may not be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms, on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nA change of control under the indenture governing the Notes may also result in an event of default under our Credit Facilities which may cause the acceleration of indebtedness outstanding thereunder, in which case, proceeds of collateral pledged to secure borrowings thereunder would be used to repay such borrowings before we repay the Notes. In addition, our future indebtedness may also contain restrictions on our ability to repurchase the Notes upon certain events, including transactions that could constitute a change of control under the indenture governing the Notes. Our failure to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing the Notes and would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe typical trading volume of our common stock may affect an investor\u2019s ability to sell significant stock holdings in the future without negatively impacting stock price.\nThe level of trading activity may vary daily and typically represents only a small percentage of outstanding shares. As a result, a stockholder who sells a significant amount of shares in a short period of time could negatively affect our share price.\nOur amount of debt may require us to raise additional capital to fund operations.\nWe may sell additional shares of common stock or other equity securities to raise capital in the future, which could dilute the value of an investor\u2019s holdings.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nOur end-use markets are cyclical.\nWe sell our products into aerospace, defense, and industrial end-use markets, which are cyclical and have experienced periodic declines. Our sales are, therefore, unpredictable and tend to fluctuate based on a number of factors, including global economic conditions, geopolitical developments and conditions, and other developments affecting our end-use markets and the customers served. Consequently, results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the operating results that may be experienced in any future period.\nWe depend upon a selected base of industries and customers, which subjects us to unique risks which may adversely affect us.\nWe currently generate a majority of our revenue from customers in the aerospace and defense industry. Our business depends, in part, on the level of new military and commercial aircraft orders. As a result, we have significant sales to certain customers. Sales to the Boeing Company comprise the majority of our commercial aerospace end-use market. A significant portion of our net sales in our military and space end-use markets are made under subcontracts with OEMs, under their prime contracts with the U. S. Government. We had significant sales to Raytheon Company in 2014 in our defense technologies end-use market.\nOur customers may experience delays in the launch of new products, labor strikes, diminished liquidity or credit unavailability, weak demand for their products, or other difficulties in their business. In addition, sequestration is causing additional uncertainty in the placement of orders.\nOur sales to our top ten customers, which represented approximately 59% of our total 2014 net revenues, were diversified over a number of different military and space, commercial aerospace, natural resources, industrial, medical and other products. Any significant change in production rates by these customers would have a material effect on our results of operations and cash flows. There is no assurance that our current significant customers will continue to buy products from us at current levels, and that we will retain any or all of our existing customers, or that we will be able to form new relationships with customers upon the loss of one or more of our existing customers. This risk may be further complicated by pricing pressures, intense\ncompetition prevalent in our industry and other factors. A significant reduction in sales to any of our major customers, the loss of a major customer, or a default on a major customer on accounts receivable could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nIn addition, we generally make sales under purchase orders and contracts that are subject to cancellation, modification or rescheduling. Changes in the economic environment and the financial condition of the industries we serve could result in customer cancellation of contractual orders or requests for rescheduling. Some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to schedule and performance, and failure to deliver in accordance with such provisions could result in cancellations, modifications, rescheduling and/or penalties, in some cases at the customers\u2019 convenience and without prior notice. While we have normally recovered our direct and indirect costs, such cancellations, modifications, or rescheduling that cannot be replaced in a timely fashion, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nA significant portion of our business depends upon U.S. Government defense spending.\nWe derive a significant portion of our business from customers whose principal sales are to the U.S. Government and from direct sales by us to the U.S. Government. Accordingly, the success of our business depends upon government spending generally or for specific departments or agencies in particular. Such spending, among other factors, is subject to the uncertainties of governmental appropriations and national defense policies and priorities, constraints of the budgetary process, timing and potential changes in these policies and priorities, and the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations.\nThese and other factors could cause the government and government agencies, or prime contractors that use us as a subcontractor, to reduce their purchases under existing contracts, to exercise their rights to terminate contracts at-will or to abstain from exercising options to renew contracts, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, certain U.S. Government programs in which we participate may extend for several years; however, these programs are typically funded annually. Changes in the government\u2019s strategy and priorities may affect our existing programs and future opportunities. Our government contracts and related orders with the U.S. Government are subject to cancellation, or delay, if appropriations for subsequent performance periods are not made. The termination of funding for existing or new U.S. Government programs, or delays in payment, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Although we are not yet able to determine how sequestration will impact specific programs and contracts related to us, we expect the reduced U.S. Department of Defense (\u201cU.S. DoD\u201d) budgeted spending that began in fiscal 2014 will continue to result in lower or delayed awards on some of our programs. Reductions, cancellations or delays impacting existing contracts or programs could have a material effect on our financial results.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.\nThe accuracy and appropriateness of certain costs and expenses used to substantiate our direct and indirect costs for the U.S. Government contracts are subject to extensive regulation and audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency, an arm of the U.S. DoD. Such audits and reviews could result in adjustments to our contract costs and profitability. However, we cannot ensure the outcome of any future audits and adjustments may be required to reduce net sales or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. If any audit or review were to uncover inaccurate costs or improper activities, we could be subject to penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from conducting future business with the U.S. Government. Any such outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nContracts with some of our customers, including Federal government contracts, contain provisions which give our customers a variety of rights that are unfavorable to us and the OEMs to whom we provide products and services, including the ability to terminate a contract at any time for convenience.\nContracts with some of our customers, including Federal government contracts, contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that provide rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts. These provisions may allow our customers to:\n\u2022\nterminate existing contracts, in whole or in part, for convenience, as well as for default, or if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;\n\u2022\nsuspend or debar us from doing business with the federal government or with a governmental agency;\n\u2022\nprohibit future procurement awards with a particular agency as a result of a finding of an organizational conflict of interest based upon prior related work performed for the agency that would give a contractor an unfair advantage over competing contractors;\n\u2022\nclaim rights in products and systems produced by us; and\n\u2022\ncontrol or prohibit the export of the products and related services we offer.\nIf the U.S. Government terminates a contract for convenience, the counterparty with whom we have contracted on a subcontract may terminate its contract with us. As a result of any such termination, whether on a direct government contract or subcontract, we may recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the U.S. Government terminates a direct contract with us for default, we may not even recover those amounts and instead may be liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in procuring undelivered items and services from another source. Contracts with foreign governments generally contain similar provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the customer.\nIn addition, the U.S. Government is typically required to open all programs to competitive bidding and, therefore, may not automatically renew any of its prime contracts. If one or more of our government prime or subcontracts is terminated or cancelled, our failure to replace sales generated from such contracts would result in lower sales and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther consolidation in the aerospace industry could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nThe aerospace and defense industry is experiencing significant consolidation, including our customers, competitors and suppliers. Consolidation among our customers may result in delays in the award of new contracts and losses of existing business. Consolidation among our competitors may result in larger competitors with greater resources and market share, which could adversely affect our ability to compete successfully. Consolidation among our suppliers may result in fewer sources of supply and increased cost to us.\nWe rely on our suppliers to meet the quality or delivery expectations of our customers.\nOur ability to deliver our products and services on schedule is dependent upon a variety of factors, including execution of internal performance plans, availability of raw materials, internal and supplier produced parts and structures, conversion of raw materials into parts and assemblies, and performance of suppliers and others.\nWe rely on numerous third-party suppliers for raw materials and a large proportion of the components used in our production process. Certain of these raw materials and components are available only from single sources or a limited number of suppliers, or similarly, customers\u2019 specifications may require us to obtain raw materials and/or components from a single source or certain suppliers. Many of our suppliers are small companies with limited financial resources and manufacturing capabilities. We do not currently have the ability to manufacture these components ourselves. These and other factors, including the loss of a critical supplier or raw materials and/or component shortages, could cause disruptions or cost inefficiencies in our operations compared to our competitors that have greater direct purchasing power, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe use estimates when bidding on fixed-price contracts. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe enter into contracts providing for a firm, fixed-price for the sale of some of our products regardless of the production costs incurred by us. In many cases, we make multi-year firm, fixed-price commitments to our customers, without assurance that our anticipated production costs will be achieved. Contract bidding and accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract net sales and costs, including estimating cost increases over time and efficiencies to be gained, and making assumptions for supplier sourcing and quality, manufacturing scheduling and technical issues over the life of the contract. Such assumptions can be particularly difficult to estimate for contracts with new customers. Our failure to accurately estimate these costs can result in reduced profits or incurred losses. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimates involved, it is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Therefore, any changes in our underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded a charge in the DAS segment for the estimated cost to complete of approximately $5.2 million, consisting of $3.9 million for the Embraer Legacy 450/500 aircraft contracts, and $1.3 million for the Boeing 777 wing tip contract. The charges resulted from difficulties in achieving previously anticipated cost reductions, including delays in transferring work to our lower-cost Guaymas, Mexico facility. The charge for the Embraer Legacy 450/500 contracts also reflects estimated cost overruns for customer driven changes on both the development and production phases of the contracts. See \u201cRevenue Recognition\u201d and \u201cProvision for\nEstimated Losses on Contracts\u201d in Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis-Critical Accounting Policies, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nAs we move up the value chain to become a Tier 2 supplier, enhanced design, product development, manufacturing, supply chain project management and other skills will be required.\nWe may encounter difficulties as we execute our growth strategy to move up the value chain to become a Tier 2 supplier of more complex, value-added assemblies. Difficulties we may encounter include, but are not limited to, the need for enhanced and expanded product design skills, enhanced ability to control and influence our suppliers, enhanced quality control systems and infrastructure, enhanced large-scale project management skills, and expanded industry certifications. Assuming incremental project design responsibilities would require us to assume additional risk in developing cost estimates and could expose us to increased risk of losses. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining the enhanced skills required to be a Tier 2 supplier or that our customers will outsource such functions to us.\nRisks associated with operating and conducting our business outside the United States could adversely impact us.\nWe have facilities in Thailand and Mexico and also derive a portion of our net sales from direct foreign sales. Further, our customers may derive portions of their sales to non-U.S. customers. As a result, we are subject to the risks of conducting and operating our business internationally, including:\n\u2022\npolitical instability;\n\u2022\neconomic and geopolitical developments and conditions;\n\u2022\ncompliance with a variety of international laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies conducting business abroad, including, but not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022\nimposition of taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes and other trade restrictions; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties repatriating funds or restrictions on cash transfers.\nWhile the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nGoodwill and/or other assets could be impaired in the future, which could result in substantial charges.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis during our fourth quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances occur which could indicate potential impairment. We also test intangible assets with indefinite life periods for potential impairment annually and on an interim basis if there are indicators of potential impairment. We evaluate amortizable intangible assets, fixed assets, and production cost of contracts for impairment if there are indicators of a potential impairment. In assessing the recoverability of goodwill, management is required to make certain critical estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include projected sales levels, including addition of new customers, programs or platforms and increased content on existing programs or platforms, improvements in manufacturing efficiency, and reductions in operating costs. Due to many variables inherent in the estimation of a business\u2019s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in estimates and assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis. If any of these or other estimates and assumptions are not realized in the future, or if market multiples decline, we may be required to record an impairment charge for goodwill in addition to the pre-tax impairment charge of approximately $54.3 million recorded in 2011. Impairment charges may be incurred against other intangible assets or long-term assets if asset utilization declines, customer demand declines or other circumstances indicate that the asset carrying value may not be recoverable. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded a pre-tax asset impairment charge of $7.0 million to production cost of contracts for the Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Boeing 777 wing tip contracts. Our production cost of contracts as of December 31, 2014 was approximately $11.7 million or 1.6% of total assets. Our goodwill and other intangible assets as of December 31, 2014 were approximately $312.7 million, or 42% of total assets. See \u201cGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\u201d and \u201cProduction Cost of Contracts\u201d in Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis-Critical Accounting Policies, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nOTHER RISKS\nOur operations are subject to numerous extensive, complex, costly and evolving laws, regulations and restrictions, and failure to comply with these laws, regulations and restrictions could subject us to penalties and sanctions that could harm our business.\nPrime contracts with various agencies of the U.S. Government, and subcontracts with other prime contractors, are subject to numerous laws and regulations which affect how we do business with our customers and may impose added costs on our\nbusiness. As a result, our contracts and operations are subject to numerous, extensive, complex, costly and evolving laws, regulation and restrictions, principally by the U.S. Government or their agencies. These laws, regulation and restrictions govern items including, but not limited to, the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts, disclosure of cost and pricing data, civil penalties for violations or false claims to the U.S. Government for payment, define reimbursable costs, establish ethical standards for the procurement process and control the import and export of defense articles and services.\nNoncompliance could expose us to liability for penalties, including termination of our U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts, disqualification from bidding on future U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts, suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting and various other fines and penalties. Noncompliance found by any one agency could result in fines, penalties, debarment or suspension from receiving additional contracts with all U.S. Government agencies. Given our dependence on U.S. Government business, suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nIn addition, the U.S. Government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new contract rules and regulations, at any time, including increased usage of fixed-price contracts and procurement reform. Such changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or subcontracts or renew contracts or subcontracts under which we currently perform when those contracts are put up for recompetition. Any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement and could adversely affect our future net sales.\nIn addition, our international operations subject us to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, repatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. Changes in regulations or political environments may affect our ability to conduct business in foreign markets including investment, procurement and repatriation of earnings. Failure by us or our sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in certain liabilities and could possibly result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nCustomer pricing pressures could reduce the demand and/or price for our products and services.\nAll the markets we serve are highly competitive and price sensitive. We compete worldwide with a number of domestic and international companies that have substantially greater manufacturing, purchasing, marketing and financial resources than we do. Many of our customers have the in-house capability to fulfill their manufacturing requirements. Our larger competitors may be able to vie more effectively for very large-scale contracts than we can by providing different or greater capabilities or benefits such as technical qualifications, past performance on large-scale contracts, geographic presence, price and availability of key professional personnel. If we are unable to successfully compete for new business, our net sales growth and operating margins may decline.\nSeveral of our major customers have completed extensive cost containment efforts and we expect continued pricing pressures in 2015 and beyond. Competitive pricing pressures may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Further, there can be no assurance that competition from existing or potential competitors in other segments of our business will not have a material adverse effect on our financial results. If we do not continue to compete effectively and win contracts, our future business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to meet our financial obligations may be materially compromised.\nOur products and processes are subject to risks of obsolescence as a result of changes in technology and evolving industry and regulatory standards.\nThe future success of our business depends in large part upon our and our customers\u2019 ability to maintain and enhance technological capabilities, develop and market manufacturing services that meet changing customer needs and successfully anticipate or respond to technological advances in manufacturing processes on a cost-effective and timely basis, while meeting evolving industry and regulatory standards. To address these risks, we invest in product design and development, and undertake capital expenditures. There can be no guarantee that our product design and development efforts will be successful, or that funds required to be invested in product design and development or incurred as capital expenditures will not increase materially in the future.\nEnvironmental liabilities could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to various U.S. and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the use, storage, transport, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals and materials used and emissions generated during our manufacturing process. We do not carry insurance for these potential environmental liabilities. Any failure by us to comply with present or future regulations could subject us to future liabilities or the suspension of production, which could have a material adverse\neffect on our financial results. Moreover, some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can impose joint and several liability retroactively regardless of fault or the legality of the activities giving rise to the contamination. Compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations may require extensive capital expenditures, increase our cost or impact our production capabilities. Even if such expenditures are made, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply. We have been directed to investigate and take corrective action for groundwater contamination at certain sites. Our ultimate liability for such matters will depend upon a number of factors. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nCyber security attacks, internal system or service failures may adversely impact our business and operations.\nAny system or service disruptions, including those caused by projects to improve our information technology systems, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide products and related services to our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could also be subject to systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, third-party service providers, intruders or hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks. Cyber security threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, unauthorized attempts to gain access to sensitive, confidential or otherwise protected information related to us or our products, customers or suppliers, or other acts that could lead to disruptions in our business. Any such failures could cause loss of data and interruptions or delays in our business, cause us to incur remediation costs, subject us to claims and damage our reputation. In addition, the failure or disruption of our communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not have the ability to renew facilities leases on terms favorable to us and relocation of operations presents risks due to business interruption.\nCertain of our manufacturing facilities and offices are leased and have lease terms that expire between 2015 and 2020. The majority of these leases provide renewal options at the fair market rental rate at the time of renewal, which, if renewed, could be significantly higher than our current rental rates. We may be unable to offset these cost increases by charging more for our products and services. Furthermore, continued economic conditions may continue to negatively impact and create greater pressure in the commercial real estate market, causing higher incidences of landlord default and/or lender foreclosure of properties, including properties occupied by us. While we maintain certain non-disturbance rights in most cases, it is not certain that such rights will in all cases be upheld and our continued right of occupancy in such instances is potentially jeopardized. An occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nAdditionally, if we choose to move any of our operations, those operations will be subject to additional relocation costs and associated risks of business interruption.\nThe occurrence of litigation in which we could be named as a defendant is unpredictable.\nFrom time to time, we and our subsidiaries are involved in various legal and other proceedings that are incidental to the conduct of our business. While we believe no current proceedings, if adversely determined, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, no assurances can be given. Any such claims may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nProduct liability claims in excess of insurance could adversely affect our financial results and financial condition.\nWe face potential liability for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of products designed or manufactured by us. Although we currently maintain product liability insurance (including aircraft product liability insurance), any material product liability not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDamage or destruction of our facilities caused by storms, earthquake or other causes could adversely affect our financial results and financial condition.\nWe have operations located in regions of the U.S. that may be exposed to damaging storms, earthquakes and other natural disasters. Although we maintain standard property casualty insurance covering our properties and may be able to recover costs associated with certain natural disasters through insurance, we do not carry any earthquake insurance because of the cost of such insurance. Many of our properties are located in Southern California, an area subject to earthquake activity. Our California facilities generated approximately $251.8 million in net sales during 2014. Even if covered by insurance, any significant damage or destruction of our facilities due to storms, earthquakes or other natural disasters could result in our inability to meet\ncustomer delivery schedules and may result in the loss of customers and significant additional costs to us. Thus, any significant damage or destruction of our properties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain key engineering, technical and managerial personnel, at both the executive and plant level. We face competition for management, engineering and technical personnel from other companies and organizations. The loss of members of our senior management group, or key engineering and technical personnel, could negatively impact our ability to grow and remain competitive in the future and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nLabor disruptions by our employees could adversely affect our business.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we employed approximately 3,150 people. Two of our operating units are parties to collective bargaining agreements, covering 159 full time hourly employees and 219 employees, and will expire July 1, 2015 and January 1, 2016, respectively. Although we have not experienced any material labor-related work stoppage and consider our relations with our employees to be good, labor stoppages may occur in the future. If the unionized workers were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements with the unions or if other employees were to become unionized, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, higher ongoing labor costs and possible loss of customer contracts, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, adversely impact the reliability of our financial reports, cause us to submit our financial reports in an untimely fashion, result in material misstatements in our financial statements and cause current and potential stockholders to lose confidence in our financial reporting, which in turn could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have concluded that there are material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as 1) the process to communicate, educate, and measure our employees\u2019 understanding of ethical standards and code of conduct across the company was not maintained, 2) the structure, authority, and responsibilities to ensure the objectives of internal control over financial reporting were adequately achieved was not maintained, 3) the design of our internal controls did not include a review of the accuracy of labor distribution to various departments and 4) the process to reconcile and review our income tax accounts was not adequate. These material weaknesses resulted in material misstatements of our historical financial statements, which necessitated a restatement of our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2013 and for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 and our unaudited quarterly financial information for the first three quarters in the year ended December 31, 2014 and for each of the quarters in the year ended December 31, 2013 to correct for errors in the contract forward loss reserve, cost of goods sold, deferred income taxes, goodwill, goodwill impairment, additional-paid-in-capital and income tax expense, as applicable, in each reporting period. Additionally, these material weaknesses could result in a material misstatement of account balances or disclosures that would result in a misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Thus, management has determined that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2014.\nUnder standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. The existence of this issue could adversely affect us, our reputation or investor perceptions of us. We have and will continue to take additional measures to remediate the underlying causes of the material weaknesses noted above. As we continue to evaluate and work to remediate the material weaknesses, we may determine to take additional measures to address the control deficiencies. Also, see Item 9A in Part II of this Form 10-K. We expect to incur additional costs remediating these material weaknesses.\nAlthough we plan to complete this remediation process as quickly as possible, we cannot at this time estimate how long it will take, and our measures may not prove to be successful in remediating these material weaknesses. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results. In addition, if we are unable to successfully remediate these material weaknesses and if we are unable to produce accurate and timely financial statements, our stock price may be adversely affected and we may be unable to maintain compliance with applicable stock exchange listing requirements and debt covenant requirements.\nThe restatement of our consolidated financial statements and possible related events, should they occur, may consume our time and resources and may have an adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nAs discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Form 10-K, we have restated in this Form 10-K our consolidated financial statements to correct errors in prior periods primarily related to (i) a long-term contract (\u201cContract\u201d) following the discovery of misconduct by employees in the recording of direct labor costs to the Contract from 2009 through the third quarter 2014 which resulted in the identification of a forward loss provision that should have been recorded in 2009 and the impact on subsequent periods of adjustments to the forward loss provision based on information available at the time; and (ii) the year end reconciliation of income taxes payable and deferred tax balances identified errors primarily in 2013, 2012, and 2011.\nAs with all corporate controls, we cannot be certain that the measures we have taken, and are taking, to remedy the errors since they were discovered will ensure that no errors occur in the future. Further, the restatement may affect investor confidence in the accuracy of our financial reporting and disclosures, may raise reputational issues for our business and may negatively impact our stock price.\nAlthough we have now completed the restatement, we cannot guarantee that we will not receive regulatory inquiries or be subject to litigation regarding our restated financial statements or related matters. Were any such future regulatory inquiries or litigation to occur, regardless of the outcome, such actions would likely consume internal resources and result in additional legal and consulting costs.\nEnacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations have increased our costs and may continue to increase our costs in the future.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), enacted in July 2010, expands federal regulation of corporate governance matters. While some provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are effective upon enactment, others will be implemented upon the SEC\u2019s adoption of related rules and regulations. The scope and timing of the adoption of such rules and regulations is uncertain and accordingly, the cost of compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act is also uncertain.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries that are believed to be benefiting armed groups (\u201cConflict Minerals\u201d). The provision does not prevent companies from using conflict minerals; however the SEC mandates due diligence, disclosure and reporting requirements for companies which manufacture products that include components containing such conflict minerals in a Form SD (\u201cForm SD\u201d). These due diligence, disclosure and initial reporting requirements applied to our activities in calendar year 2013 and our first annual filing was completed by the June 2, 2014 due date. These regulations and disclosures in our Form SDs could result in our customers\u2019 request to not use Conflict Minerals in our products they purchase from us. The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited and thus, decrease the availability and increase the prices of components free of such Conflict Minerals used in our products. In addition, the compliance process will be both time-consuming and costly. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through our due diligence procedures, which may harm our reputation with our customers and other stakeholders. In addition, we may be unable to satisfy customers who require that all components included in our products be conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur efforts to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act and other evolving laws, regulations and standards are likely to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities. Further, compliance with new and existing laws, rules, regulations and standards may make it more difficult and expensive for us to maintain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage.", "PERMNO": 63132, "SIC": 3728, "TIC": "DCO"}
