{"cik": "1282266", "company": "WINDSTREAM HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Chapter 11 Reorganization\nWe are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with Chapter 11 proceedings.\nOn February 25, 2019 (the \u201cPetition Date\u201d), Windstream Holdings and all of its subsidiaries, including Windstream Services (collectively, the \u201cDebtors\u201d), filed voluntary petitions for relief (the \u201cChapter 11 Cases\u201d) under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the \u201cBankruptcy Code\u201d) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the \u201cBankruptcy Court\u201d).\nThe Chapter 11 Cases are being jointly administered under the caption In re Windstream Holdings, Inc., et al., No 19-22312 (RDD). We will continue to operate our businesses as \u201cdebtors-in-possession\u201d under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.\nFor the duration of our Chapter 11 proceedings, our operations and our ability to develop and execute our business plan are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy, including the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, confirm and consummate a Chapter 11 plan or alternative restructuring transaction;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain court approval with respect to motions filed in Chapter 11 Cases from time to time;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain our relationships with our suppliers, service providers, customers, employees and other third parties;\n\u2022\nour ability to continue to invest in our business, which could hurt our competitiveness;\n\u2022\nour ability to enter into or maintain contracts that are critical to our operations at competitive rates and terms;\n\u2022\nour ability to execute our business plan;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain acceptable and appropriate financing;\n\u2022\nthe ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to terminate contracts and other agreements with us;\n\u2022\nthe ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to terminate or shorten the exclusivity period for us to propose and confirm a Chapter 11 plan, to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee, or to convert the Chapter 11 Cases to Chapter 7 cases; and\n\u2022\nthe actions and decisions of our creditors and other third parties who have interests in our Chapter 11 Cases that may be inconsistent with our plans.\nThese risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways, such as adversely impacting our relationships with our suppliers, service providers, customers, employees and other third parties, which in turn could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Also, we need the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court for transactions outside the ordinary course of business, which may limit our ability to respond timely to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities.\nBecause of the risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 proceedings, we cannot accurately predict or quantify the ultimate impact of events that will occur during our Chapter 11 proceedings that may be inconsistent with our plans.\nOperating under Chapter 11 may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nUnder Chapter 11, transactions outside the ordinary course of business will be subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit our ability to respond in a timely manner to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities. We must obtain Bankruptcy Court approval to, among other things:\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions with our vendors;\n\u2022\nbuy or sell assets outside the ordinary course of business;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\ngrant liens; and\n\u2022\nfinance our operations, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nAdverse publicity in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases or otherwise could negatively affect our businesses.\nAdverse publicity or news coverage relating to us, including, but not limited to, publicity or news coverage in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, may negatively impact our efforts to establish and promote name recognition and a positive image after emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases.\nThe Chapter 11 Cases limit the flexibility of our management team in running our business.\nWhile we operate our businesses as debtor-in-possession under supervision by the Bankruptcy Court, we are required to obtain the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and, in some cases, certain lenders prior to engaging in activities or transactions outside the ordinary course of business. Bankruptcy Court approval of non-ordinary course activities entails preparation and filing of appropriate motions with the Bankruptcy Court, negotiation with the creditors\u2019 committee and other parties-in-interest and one or more hearings. The creditors\u2019 committees and other parties-in interest may be heard at any Bankruptcy Court hearing and may raise objections with respect to these motions. This process may delay major transactions and limit our ability to respond quickly to opportunities and events in the marketplace. Furthermore, in the event the Bankruptcy Court does not approve a proposed activity or transaction, we would be prevented from engaging in activities and transactions that we believe are beneficial to us.\nOur senior management team and other key personnel may not be able to execute the business plans as currently developed, given the substantial attention required of such individuals by the Chapter 11 Cases.\nThe execution of our business plans depends on the efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel to execute our business plans. Such individuals may be required to devote significant efforts to the prosecution of the Chapter 11 Cases, thereby potentially impairing their abilities to execute our business plans. Accordingly, our business plans may not be implemented as anticipated, which may cause its financial results to materially deviate from the current projections.\nThe pursuit of the bankruptcy filing has consumed and will continue to consume a substantial portion of the time and attention of our management, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and we may face increased levels of employee attrition.\nLeading up to and following commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, our management was required to spend a significant amount of time and effort focusing on the filings. This diversion of attention may materially adversely affect the conduct of our business, and, as a result, our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if a Chapter 11 plan is not confirmed. During the continued pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, our employees are facing distraction and uncertainty and we may experience increased levels of employee attrition. We are highly dependent on the continuing efforts of our executive officers and other personnel as our executive officers have substantial experience and expertise in our industry and have made significant contributions to our business. Uncertainty as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel, and loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer expectations and could require the incurrence of substantial additional costs to recruit replacement personnel, thereby adversely affecting our business and results of operations. In addition, we could experience losses of customers who may be concerned about our long-term viability.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, our financial results may be volatile and may not reflect historical trends.\nDuring the Chapter 11 Cases, we expect our financial results to be volatile as restructuring activities and expenses, contract terminations and rejections, and claims assessments significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance is likely not indicative of our financial performance after the date of the bankruptcy filing. In addition, if we emerge from Chapter 11, the amounts reported in subsequent consolidated financial statements may materially change relative to historical consolidated financial statements, including as a result of revisions to our operating plans pursuant to a plan of reorganization. We also may be required to adopt fresh start accounting upon emergence, in which case our assets and liabilities will be recorded at fair value as of the fresh start reporting date, which may differ materially from the recorded values of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our financial results after the application of fresh start accounting also may be different from historical trends.\nWe may be unable to comply with restrictions or with budget, liquidity or other covenants imposed by the agreements governing the DIP financing and our other financing arrangements. Such non-compliance could result in an event of default under the terms of the DIP financing that, if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe agreements governing our debtor-in-possession (the \u201cDIP\u201d) financing impose a number of restrictions on us. Specifically, the terms of the credit agreement governing the DIP financing impose certain obligations including, among other things, affirmative covenants requiring us to provide financial information, budgets and other information to the agent under the DIP financing, and negative covenants restricting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, dispose of assets, pay dividends or take certain other actions, in each case except as permitted in by the terms of the DIP financing. Our ability to borrow under the DIP financing is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent. Covenants of the DIP facility include general affirmative covenants, as well as negative covenants such as prohibiting us from incurring or permitting debt, investments, liens or dispositions unless specifically permitted. Failure to comply with these covenants would result in an event of default under the DIP facilities and permit the lenders thereunder to accelerate the loans and otherwise exercise remedies under the loan documentation for the DIP facilities. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control and our failure to comply or obtain a waiver in the event we cannot comply with a covenant could result in an event of default under the agreements governing the DIP financing and our other financing arrangements.\nWe may not be able to obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization.\nTo emerge successfully from Bankruptcy Court protection as a viable entity, we must meet certain statutory requirements with respect to adequacy of disclosure related to the plan of reorganization, solicit and obtain the requisite acceptances of such a plan and fulfill other statutory conditions for confirmation of such a plan, which have not occurred to date. The confirmation process is subject to unanticipated potential delays, including a delay in the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s commencement of the confirmation hearing regarding our plan of reorganization.\nWe may not receive the requisite acceptances of constituencies in the Chapter 11 proceedings to confirm our plan of reorganization. Even if the requisite acceptances of our plan of reorganization are received, the Bankruptcy Court may not confirm such a plan. The precise requirements and evidentiary showing for confirming a plan, notwithstanding its rejection by one or more impaired classes of claims or equity interests, depends upon a number of factors, including, without limitation, the status and seniority of the claims or equity interests in the rejecting class (i.e., unsecured claims or secured claims, subordinated or senior claims).\nIf a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is not confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it is unclear whether we would be able to reorganize our business and what, if anything, holders of claims against us would ultimately receive with respect to their claims.\nEven if a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is consummated, we will continue to face risks.\nEven if a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is consummated, we will continue to face a number of risks, including certain risks that are beyond our control, such as further deterioration or other changes in economic conditions, changes in our industry and potential revaluing of our assets due to the Chapter 11 Cases. Some of these concerns and effects typically become more acute when a case under the Bankruptcy Code continues for a protracted period without indication of how or when the case may be completed. As a result of these risks and others, there is no guarantee that any plan of reorganization will achieve our stated goals.\nFurthermore, we cannot predict the ultimate amount of all settlement terms for the Debtors\u2019 liabilities that will be subject to a plan of reorganization. Even if our debts are reduced or discharged through a plan of reorganization, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing or other various means to fund our business after the completion of the Chapter 11 process. Adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms. Even once a plan of reorganization is implemented, our operating results may be adversely affected by the possible reluctance of customers to do business with a company that recently emerged from bankruptcy proceedings.\nOperating under Bankruptcy Court protection for a long period of time may harm our business.\nOur future results are dependent upon the successful confirmation and implementation of a plan of reorganization. A long period of operations under Bankruptcy Court protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nIf the proceedings related to the Bankruptcy Filings continue for a longer period than anticipated, customers and suppliers may lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our business successfully and will seek to establish alternative commercial relationships.\nFurthermore, so long as the Chapter 11 proceedings continue, we will be required to incur substantial costs for professional fees and other expenses associated with the administration of the Chapter 11 proceedings. If we require additional debtor-in-possession financing and are unable to obtain it on favorable terms or at all, our chances of successfully reorganizing our business may be seriously jeopardized, the likelihood that we instead will be required to liquidate our assets may be enhanced, and, as a result, any securities in us could become further devalued or become worthless. Furthermore, we cannot predict the ultimate amount of all settlement terms for the liabilities that will be subject to a plan of reorganization. Even once a plan of reorganization is approved and implemented, our operating results may be adversely affected by the possible reluctance of prospective lenders and other counterparties to do business with a company that recently emerged from Chapter 11 proceedings.\nThird parties may propose competing Chapter 11 plans of reorganization and we may receive unsolicited offers for Windstream or our assets.\nChapter 11 gives us the exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization during the first 120 days after filing. That period can be extended for cause up to a total of 18 months from the Petition Date with approval of the Bankruptcy Court. While we intend to conclude our Chapter 11 Cases during this \u201cexclusivity period\u201d, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. There is also no assurance that a plan of reorganization we propose will be approved by the requisite creditors and the Bankruptcy Court. After the expiration of the exclusivity period, third parties can file one or more Chapter 11 plans of reorganization for the Debtors. An alternative plan of reorganization could contemplate Windstream continuing as a going concern, Windstream being broken up, Windstream or its assets being acquired by a third party, Windstream being merged with a competitor or some other proposal. We may not believe that such an alternative plan of reorganization is in our stakeholders\u2019 best interests or fully values the benefits to be achieved by our reorganization. If we cannot successfully obtain approval of our plan of reorganization during the exclusivity period, we may have limited ability to prevent an alternative plan of reorganization from being approved by the Bankruptcy Court.\nCompanies in Chapter 11 are often the target of unsolicited merger and acquisition offers, and there is no guarantee that we will emerge from Chapter 11 as a standalone company. An unsolicited proposal or alternative plan of reorganization could potentially delay our emergence from Chapter 11 and expose us to a number of other risks, including potential limitations on our ability to execute our business plan and strategic initiatives; difficulties in hiring, retaining and motivating key personnel; negative reactions among our employees, vendors, strategic partners and service providers; a failure to provide stakeholders full value for the benefits that could be achieved by Windstream post-emergence on a stand-alone basis; and unease and uncertainty among our customer base. In addition, any potential transaction proposed during Chapter 11, even if we decided such transaction was in our best interest, would be expressly subject to Bankruptcy Code requirements and Bankruptcy Court approval.\nIn certain specific instances, including, if we are not able to obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, if current financing is insufficient, or if exit financing is not available, a Chapter 11 case may be converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, and may result in significant smaller distributions to our creditors than under a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization.\nIn order to successfully emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, we must develop and obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization by the Bankruptcy Court. There can be no assurance that we will be able to confirm a plan of reorganization that will permit us to emerge from bankruptcy and continue operations. There can be no assurance that our access to liquidity, including funds available from our DIP financing and amounts of cash from future operations, will be sufficient to fund ongoing operations.\nIf the Bankruptcy Court finds, after much consideration, that it would be in the best interest of creditors and/or us, the Bankruptcy Court could convert our Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases to cases under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In such event, a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate our assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. We believe that liquidation under Chapter 7 would result in significantly smaller distributions being made to our creditors than those provided for in a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization because of (i) the likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a disorderly fashion over a short period of time rather than reorganizing or selling in a controlled manner our business as a going concern, (ii) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a Chapter 7 trustee, and (iii) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, that would be generated during the liquidation and from the rejection of leases and other executory contracts in connection with a cessation of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the Chapter 11 Cases, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to confirmation. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to the Petition Date, or before confirmation of the Chapter 11 plan of reorganization (i) would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the Chapter 11 plan of reorganization and/or (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the terms of the Chapter 11 plan of reorganization. Any claims not ultimately discharged through the Chapter 11 plan of reorganization could be asserted against the reorganized entities and may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations on a post-reorganization basis.\nOur cash flows may not provide sufficient liquidity during the Chapter 11 Cases. Our long-term liquidity requirements and the adequacy of our capital resources are difficult to predict at this time.\nOur ability to fund our operations and our capital expenditures require a significant amount of cash. Our principal sources of liquidity historically have been cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity under the senior secured revolving credit facility and issuances of other debt. If our cash flow from operations decreases, we may not have the ability to expend the capital necessary to improve or maintain our current operations, resulting in decreased revenues over time.\nWe face uncertainty regarding the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources and have extremely limited, if any, access to additional financing. In addition to the cash requirements necessary to fund ongoing operations, we have incurred significant professional fees and other costs in connection with preparation for the Chapter 11 proceedings and expect that we will continue to incur significant professional fees and costs throughout our Chapter 11 proceedings. In addition, we must comply with the covenants of our DIP financing in order to continue to access our borrowings thereunder. We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with the covenants of our DIP financing or that cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to continue to fund our operations and allow us to satisfy our obligations related to the Chapter 11 Cases until we are able to emerge from our Chapter 11 Cases.\nOur liquidity, including our ability to meet our ongoing operational obligations, is dependent upon, among other things: (i) our ability to comply with the terms and conditions of our DIP financing agreements, (ii) our ability to comply with the terms and conditions of any cash collateral order that may be entered by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, (iii) our ability to maintain adequate cash on hand, (iv) our ability to generate cash flow from operations, (v) our ability to develop, confirm and consummate a Chapter 11 plan or other alternative restructuring transaction and (vi) the cost, duration and outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nIf we have substantial indebtedness upon emergence from Chapter 11, it may adversely affect our financial health and operating flexibility.\nUpon emergence from Chapter 11, we may have substantial indebtedness that could have important consequences to us, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service debt;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates, particularly given our substantial indebtedness which bears interest at variable rates;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability or increasing the costs to refinance indebtedness.\nTrading in our securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. It is possible our common stock will be canceled and that holders of such common stock will not receive any distribution with respect to, or be able to recover any portion of, their investments.\nIt is too early to determine if our Chapter 11 plan of reorganization will allow for distributions with respect to our common stock. It is possible that our common stock will be canceled and extinguished upon the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and the holders thereof would not be entitled to receive, and would not receive or retain, any property or interest in property on account of such equity interests. In the event of a cancellation of our common stock, amounts invested by such holders in our outstanding common stock will not be recoverable. Consequently, our currently outstanding common stock would have no value. Trading prices for our common stock are very volatile and may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by the holders of such securities in the Chapter 11 Cases. Accordingly, we urge that extreme caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in our equity securities and any of our other securities.\nOur common stock was delisted from NASDAQ and is currently traded on the OTC Pink Sheets market maintained by the OTC Market Group, Inc., which involves additional risks compared to being listed on a national securities exchange.\nTrading in our common stock was suspended and removed from listing on NASDAQ on March 6, 2019. We will not be able to relist our common stock on a national securities exchange during our Chapter 11 process, although our common stock is now quoted on the OTC Pink Sheets market maintained by the OTC Market Group, Inc. under the trading symbol \u201cWINMQ.\u201d The lack of an active market may impair the ability of holders of our common stock to sell their shares at the time they wish to sell them or at a price that they consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair market value of the shares of our common stock. Furthermore, because of the limited market and generally low volume of trading in our common stock, the price of our common stock could be more likely to be affected by broad market fluctuations, general market conditions, fluctuations in our operating results, changes in the markets\u2019 perception of our business, and announcements made by us, our competitors, parties with whom we have business relationships or third parties with interests in the Chapter 11 Cases.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOn February 15, 2019, Judge Jesse Furman of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued findings of fact and conclusions of law in litigation relating to a noteholder\u2019s allegations that our spin-off of certain assets in 2015 into a publicly-traded real estate investment trust (\u201cSpin-Off\u201d) resulted in one or more defaults of certain covenants under one of our existing indentures.\nOn September 22, 2017, we received a purported notice of default under the indenture governing our 6.375 percent senior notes due 2023 (the \u201c2013 Indenture\u201d) from a purported holder of the senior notes, which alleged that we had breached certain covenants under the 2013 Indenture, primarily that the Spin-Off constituted a sale and leaseback transaction (as defined in the 2013 Indenture) which was not in compliance with the 2013 Indenture. On November 6, 2017, we received consents from holders representing a majority of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of 6.375 percent senior notes due 2023 to certain waivers and amendments to the 2013 Indenture relating to the defaults alleged in the notice of default in connection with certain exchange and consent transactions (the \u201c2017 Exchange and Consent Transactions\u201d). On December 7, 2017, the purported holder issued a notice of acceleration claiming that the principal amount, along with accrued interest, was due and payable immediately.\nOn February 15, 2019, Judge Jesse Furman of United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued certain findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the Spin-Off and the 2017 Exchange and Consent Transactions and found that the trustee under the Indenture and/or the noteholder are entitled to a judgment:\n\u2022\ndeclaring that, in effecting the Spin-Off, we failed to comply with the covenants set forth in Section 4.19 of the 2013 Indenture restricting certain sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\ndeclaring that our breaches of Section 4.19 constitute a \u201cDefault\u201d under 2013 Indenture;\n\u2022\ndeclaring that the 6.375 percent senior notes due 2023 issued in the 2017 Exchange and Consent Transactions do not constitute \u201cAdditional Notes\u201d under the 2013 Indenture;\n\u2022\ndeclaring that the notice of default with respect to the foregoing breaches was valid and effective;\n\u2022\ndeclaring that those breaches ripened into \u201cEvents of Default\u201d as defined in the 2013 Indenture on December 6, 2017;\n\u2022\ndeclaring that the notice of acceleration with respect to those \u201cEvents of Default\u201d was valid and effective, and all principal together with all accrued and unpaid interest on the notes became immediately due and payable as of that date;\n\u2022\nenjoining us from taking any further action to issue new notes in contravention of, or to otherwise violate, the 2013 Indenture;\n\u2022\nawarding to the noteholder a money judgment in an amount of $310,459,959.10, plus interest from and after July 23, 2018; and\n\u2022\ndismissing our counterclaims with prejudice.\nOn February 25, 2019, Windstream Holdings and all of its subsidiaries, including Windstream Services, filed the Chapter 11 Cases in the Bankruptcy Court. The filing of the Chapter 11 Cases also constitutes an event of default under our debt agreements. Due to the Chapter 11 Cases, however, the creditors\u2019 ability to exercise remedies under our debt agreements were stayed as of the date of the Chapter 11 petition filing. See \u201cRisks Related to Chapter 11 Reorganization\u201d.\nOur board of directors eliminated our quarterly common stock dividend commencing in the third quarter of 2017 as part of our revised capital allocation strategy. We have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. As a result, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nOn August 3, 2017, our board of directors elected to eliminate our quarterly common stock dividend commencing in the third quarter of 2017, and we do not currently expect to declare or pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any\ndecision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, restrictions imposed by any covenants in our then existing debt instruments or imposed by our then existing indebtedness, restrictions imposed by applicable law, general business conditions and other factors considered relevant by our board of directors. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell it for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nCompetition in our business markets could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe serve business customers in markets across the country, competing against other communications providers and cable television companies for business customers. Competition in our business markets could adversely affect growth in business revenues and ultimately have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to achieve a competitive cost structure during the Chapter 11 Cases. If we are unable to compete effectively, we may be forced to lower prices or increase our sales and marketing expenses. In addition, we may need to continue to make significant capital expenditures to keep up with technological advances and offer competitive services. For additional information, see the risk factor \u201cRapid changes in technology could affect our ability to compete for business customers.\u201d\nIn certain markets where we serve business customers, we purchase significant amounts of network capacity to provide service to our customers. We utilize these facilities owned by other companies competing directly with us for business customers. For additional information, see the risk factor \u201cIn certain operating territories, we are dependent on other carriers to provide facilities which we use to provide service to our customers.\u201d\nOur substantial debt could adversely affect our cash flow and impair our ability to raise additional capital on favorable terms.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $5,728.1 million long-term debt outstanding, all of which has been classified as current in our consolidated balance as of that date due to the adverse court ruling discussed above. The commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases described above also constituted an event of default obligations under our debt instruments, including the indentures governing our notes and our credit agreement. Any efforts to enforce payment obligations under our debt instruments are automatically stayed as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases and the holders\u2019 rights of enforcement are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.\nIn connection with filing the Chapter 11 Cases, we have obtained DIP financing. The agreements governing the DIP financing impose a number of restrictions on us. Specifically, the terms of the credit agreements governing the DIP financing impose certain obligations including, among other things, affirmative covenants requiring us to provide financial information, budgets and other information to the agent under the DIP financing, and negative covenants restricting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, dispose of assets, pay dividends or take certain other actions, in each case except as permitted in by the terms of the DIP financing. Our ability to borrow under the DIP financing is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent. Covenants of the DIP facility include general affirmative covenants, as well as negative covenants such as prohibiting us from incurring or permitting debt, investments, liens or dispositions unless specifically permitted. Failure to comply with these covenants would result in an event of default under the DIP facilities and permit the lenders thereunder to accelerate the loans and otherwise exercise remedies under the loan documentation for the DIP facilities. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control and our failure to comply or obtain a waiver in the event we cannot comply with a covenant could result in an event of default under the agreements governing the DIP financing and our other financing arrangements.\nIn addition, because the Chapter 11 Cases are ongoing and there can be no assurance as to the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as: refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments, or seeking to raise additional capital. Our inability to pay off our debt obligations and our inability to obtain alternative financing due to the Chapter 11 Cases could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Additionally, we must obtain Bankruptcy Court approval for these actions, which will place us at a competitive disadvantage and limit our flexibility to react to changes in our business or our industry. See \u201cRisks Related to Chapter 11 Reorganization\u201d.\nAs of March 14, 2019, Moody\u2019s Investors Service (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d) and Fitch Ratings (\u201cFitch\u201d) had granted the following rating on our DIP facility:\nAs a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, there can be no assurance that the rating agencies will continue to issue ratings or that our ratings will not be further downgraded.\nRapid changes in technology could affect our ability to compete for business customers.\nThe technology used to deliver communications services has changed rapidly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future. If we are unable to keep up with such changes and leverage next generation technology, we may not be able to offer competitive services to our business customers. This could adversely affect our ability to compete for business customers, which, in turn, would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nCyber security incidents could have a significant operational and financial impact.\nWe store customers\u2019 proprietary business information in our facilities through our colocation, managed services and cloud computing services and we maintain certain sensitive customer and employee information in our financial and operating systems. While we have implemented data security polices and other internal controls to safeguard and protect against misuse or loss of this information, if data were compromised through a cyber security incident, it could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We have implemented network and data security policies and other internal controls to safeguard and protect against malicious interference with our networks and information technology infrastructure and related systems and technology, as well as misappropriation of data and other malfeasance through our information security initiatives and processes, but we cannot completely eliminate the risk associated with these types of occurrences. As part of our information security processes that are regularly reviewed by management and monitored by the Audit Committee, we continue to adapt to new threats, but increasing incidents of unsuccessful and successful \u201ccyber attacks\u201d, such as computer hacking, dissemination of computer viruses and denial of service attacks, as well as misappropriation of data, pose growing risks of a significant effect on our results of operations and financial condition and we cannot fully predict the evolution of such threats.\nWe may be unable to fully realize expected benefits from our recent mergers with EarthLink and Broadview.\nWe expect to continue to achieve substantial operating and capital synergies and cost savings as a result of our mergers with EarthLink Holdings Corp. and Broadview Holdings, Inc. If we are unable to complete the successful integration of the businesses, we may face material adverse effects including, but not limited to:\n\u2022diversion of the attention of management and key personnel and potential disruption of our ongoing businesses;\n\u2022customer losses;\n\u2022adverse developments in vendor relationships;\n\u2022declines in our results of operations and financial condition; and\n\u2022a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nAdditionally, there can be no assurance that the integration will result in the realization of the full benefit of the anticipated synergies and cost savings or that these benefits will be realized within the expected time frames.\nIn certain operating territories and/or at certain locations, we are dependent on other carriers to provide facilities that we use to provide service to our customers.\nIn certain markets and/or at certain locations, especially where we provide services to businesses, we may purchase a significant portion of our network capacity from other carriers. These carriers may compete directly with us for customers. The prices for network services are contained in tariffs, interconnection agreements, and negotiated contracts. Terms, conditions and pricing for tariff network services may be changed, but they must be approved by the appropriate regulatory agency before they go into effect. For network service purchased pursuant to interconnection agreements, the rates, terms and conditions included therein are approved by state commissions while other network services, such as some high-capacity Ethernet services, may be obtained through commercial contracts subject to limited government oversight.\nThe availability and pricing of network services purchased via commercial agreements are subject to change without regulatory oversight. For interconnection agreement-based network services, if an agreement cannot be negotiated and we have to invoke binding arbitration by a state regulatory agency, that process is expensive, time consuming, and the results may not be favorable to us. In addition, rates for network services set forth above are susceptible to changes in the availability and pricing of the provider\u2019s facilities and services. In the event a provider becomes legally entitled to deny or limit access to capacity (or already is, as is the case with respect to certain services) or if state commissions allow the providers to increase rates for tariffed or interconnection agreement-based rates, we may not be able to effectively compete. In addition, some carriers may seek to impose monetary penalties if we cannot meet specific volume and term commitments that are part of pricing plans. Also, if the provider does not adequately maintain or timely install these facilities, despite legal obligations, our service to customers may be adversely affected. Finally, negative events associated with our Chapter 11 Cases could adversely affect our relationship with carriers. See \u201cRisks Related to Chapter 11 Reorganization\u201d. As a result of all these items, our competitive position, our operations, financial condition and operating results could be materially affected.\nDisruptions and congestion in our networks and infrastructure may cause us to lose customers and incur additional expenses.\nOur customers depend on reliable service over our network. Some of the risks to our network infrastructure include physical damage to lines, security breaches, capacity limitations, power surges or outages, software defects and disruptions beyond our control, such as natural disasters and acts of terrorism. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we will experience disruptions in our service due to factors such as cable damage, inclement weather and service failures of our third-party service providers. Additionally, we could face disruptions due to capacity limitations as a result of changes in our customers\u2019 high-speed Internet usage patterns, resulting in a significant increase in the utilization of our network.\nWe could experience more significant disruptions in the future. Disruptions may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers, either of which could cause us to lose customers or incur additional expenses or capital expenditures. Such results could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nContinuous increases in broadband usage may cause network capacity limitations, resulting in service disruptions or reduced capacity for customers.\nBroadband consumption continues to increase, and, as a result, we could be required to make significant capital expenditures to increase network capacity to avoid service disruptions or reduced capacity for customers.\nAlternatively, we may choose to implement reasonable network management practices to reduce the network capacity available to bandwidth-intensive activities during certain times in market areas experiencing congestion, and these actions could negatively affect customer experience and increase customer churn.\nWhile we believe demand for these services may drive customers to pay for faster Internet speeds offered as part of our premium services, we may not be able to recover the costs of the necessary network investments. This could result in an adverse impact to our results of operations and financial condition.\nA change in ownership may limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards.\nIf Windstream experiences an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (an \u201cOwnership Change\u201d), it could adversely impact Windstream\u2019s ability to utilize its existing net operating loss carryforwards. In general, an Ownership Change will occur when the percentage of Windstream\u2019s common stock beneficially owned by one or more \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d (as defined under IRC Section 382) increases by more than 50 percent at any time during the prior three years (calculated on a rolling basis). Under the rules of IRC Section 382, such beneficial ownership is calculated with reference to direct, indirect, and constructive ownership. The inability to utilize existing net operating loss carryforwards would significantly increase the amount of Windstream\u2019s annual cash taxes required to be paid and reduce the overall amount of cash available to be used in other areas of Windstream\u2019s business. An Ownership Change previously occurred on March 1, 2018, but did not have a material effect on Windstream\u2019s ability to utilize its tax attributes because of rules applicable at that time that would not be applicable to an Ownership Change that occurred today.\nIn September 2015, Windstream\u2019s board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan under which Windstream shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 28, 2015 received one preferred share purchase right for each share of common stock outstanding (the \u201cRights Plan\u201d) and Windstream entered into a 382 Rights Agreement with Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (the \u201cRights Agreement\u201d). The Rights Plan is also designed to protect Windstream\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards from the effect of an Ownership Change. Pursuant to the Rights Plan, if a shareholder (or group) acquires beneficial ownership of 4.9 percent or more of Windstream\u2019s common stock without prior approval or meeting certain exceptions, shareholders (other than the acquiring shareholder or group) would be entitled to purchase additional shares of Windstream at a significant discount, resulting in significant dilution in the economic interests and voting power of the acquiring shareholder or group in Windstream. The Rights Agreement was amended on November 5, 2016, to confirm that any EarthLink shareholder that became a 4.9 percent or greater shareholder of the combined company as a result of the merger is exempt and the ownership does not trigger implementation of the Rights Plan unless the shareholder acquires additional shares of common stock. The Rights Agreement was further amended on August 7, 2018 to extend its term to September 17, 2021.\nOn February 28, 2019, in connection with Windstream\u2019s Chapter 11 filings, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York entered an order approving certain notification and hearing procedures for transfers of, and declarations of worthlessness with respect to, beneficial ownership of common stock (the \u201cOrder\u201d). The Order is designed to protect Windstream\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards from the effect of a premature Ownership Change and to preserve Windstream\u2019s ability to rely on certain favorable rules that can apply to Ownership Changes occurring in connection with the implementation of a bankruptcy plan of reorganization. The Order requires \u201csubstantial shareholders\u201d and \u201c50-percent shareholders\u201d (each as defined therein) and certain persons that might become a substantial shareholder or 50-percent shareholder, to provide notice before making certain transfers of beneficial ownership of common stock or declaring its beneficial ownership of stock worthless for U.S. income tax purposes, respectively. After receiving notice, Windstream is permitted to object, whereupon such action remains ineffective pending final resolution. Any action taken in violation of such procedures is void ab initio.\nWe are required to pay rent under the master lease with Uniti, and our ability to do so could be adversely impaired by results of our operations, changes in our cash requirements and cash tax obligations, or overall financial position; conversely, payment of the rent could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and growth and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes.\nWe are required to pay a portion of our cash flow from operations to Uniti pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the master lease. During the Chapter 11 Cases, we expect our financial results to continue to be volatile as restructuring activities and expenses can significantly impact our consolidated financial statements and affect our ability to pay the rent owed to Uniti. Our obligation to pay rent could impair our ability to fund our own operations, raise capital, make acquisitions and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes may be adversely affected, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with the provisions of the master lease with Uniti could materially adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe currently lease a significant portion of our telecommunications network assets, including our fiber and copper networks and other real estate, under the master lease with Uniti. The filing of the Chapter 11 Cases resulted in an event of default under the master lease. Upon an event of default, remedies available to Uniti include terminating the master lease and requiring us to transfer the business operations we conduct at the leased assets so terminated (with limited exceptions) to a successor tenant for fair market value pursuant to a process set forth in the master lease, dispossessing us from the leased assets, and/or collecting monetary damages for the breach (including rent acceleration), electing to leave the master lease in place and sue for rent and any other monetary damages, and seeking any and all other rights and remedies available under law or in equity. The exercise of such remedies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Due to the Chapter 11 Cases, however, Uniti\u2019s ability to exercise remedies under master lease was stayed as of the date of the Chapter 11 petition filing. See \u201cRisks Related to Chapter 11 Reorganization\u201d.\nIf the spin-off, and certain related transactions, fails to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, we could be required to indemnify Uniti for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations that we entered into with Uniti.\nWe received a private letter ruling from the IRS (the \u201cIRS Ruling\u201d) to the effect that, on the basis of certain facts presented and representations and assumptions, the spin-off will qualify as tax-free under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. Although a private letter ruling generally is binding on the IRS, if the factual representations and assumptions made are untrue or incomplete in any material respect, we will not be able to rely on the IRS Ruling. In addition, the IRS Ruling does not address certain requirements for tax-free treatment of the spin-off under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code and our use of Uniti indebtedness and common stock to retire certain of our indebtedness (the \u201cdebt exchanges\u201d). Accordingly, the spin-off was conditioned upon the receipt of a tax opinion from our tax counsel with respect to the requirements on which the IRS did not rule, which concluded that such requirements also should be satisfied. Any change in currently applicable law, which may or may not be retroactive, or the failure of any factual representation or assumption to be true, correct and complete in all material respects, could adversely affect the conclusions reached in the tax opinion. In addition, the tax opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the IRS and/or the courts may not agree with the tax opinion. However, if the spin-off or the debt exchanges failed to qualify as tax free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may incur significant tax liabilities that could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile certain tax audits regarding the tax year 2015 have concluded, if the spin-off ultimately was determined to be taxable, then a shareholder that received shares of Uniti common stock in the spin-off would be treated as having received a distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares and could incur significant income tax liabilities. Such distribution would be taxable to such shareholder as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits (including earnings and profits resulting from the recognition of gain by us in the spin-off). Any amount that exceeded our earnings and profits would be treated first as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such shareholder\u2019s tax basis in its shares of our common stock with any remaining amount being taxed as a capital gain. In addition, if the spin-off were determined to be taxable, we would recognize taxable gain.\nUnder the terms of the tax matters agreement that we entered into with Uniti, Uniti is generally responsible for any taxes imposed on us that arise from the failure of the spin-off and the debt exchanges to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, within the meaning of Section 355 and Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, as applicable, to the extent such failure to qualify is attributable to certain actions, events or transactions relating to Uniti\u2019s stock, indebtedness, assets or business, or a breach of the relevant representations or any covenants made by Uniti in the tax matters agreement, the materials submitted to the IRS in connection with the request for the IRS Ruling or the representations provided in connection with the tax opinion. Uniti\u2019s indemnification obligations to us are not limited by any maximum amount and such amounts could be substantial. If Uniti were required to indemnify us, Uniti may be subject to substantial liabilities and there can be no assurance that Uniti will be able to satisfy such indemnification obligations.\nWe are subject to various forms of regulation from the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) and state regulatory commissions in the states in which we operate, which limit our pricing flexibility for regulated voice and high-speed Internet products, subject us to service quality, service reporting and other obligations and expose us to the reduction of revenue from changes to the universal service fund, the inter-carrier compensation system, or access to interconnection with competitors\u2019 facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had operating authority from each of the 48 states and the District of Columbia in which we conducted local service operations, and we are subject to various forms of regulation from the regulatory commissions in each of these areas as well as from the FCC. State regulatory commissions have jurisdiction over local and intrastate services including, to some extent, the rates that we charge and service quality standards. The FCC has primary jurisdiction over interstate services including the rates that we charge other telecommunications companies that use our network and other issues related to interstate service. In some circumstances, these regulations restrict our ability to adjust rates to reflect market conditions and may affect our ability to compete and respond to changing industry conditions.\nFuture revenues, costs, and capital investment in our wireline business could be adversely affected by material changes to or decisions regarding applicability of government requirements, including, but not limited to, changes in rules governing inter-carrier compensation, state and federal USF support, competition policies, and other pricing and requirements. Federal and state communications laws and regulations may be amended in the future, and other laws and regulations may affect our business. In addition, certain laws and regulations applicable to us and our competitors may be, and have been, challenged in the courts and could be changed at any time. We cannot predict future developments or changes to the regulatory environment or the impact such developments or changes would have.\nIn addition, these regulations could create significant compliance costs for us. Delays in obtaining certifications and regulatory approvals could cause us to incur substantial legal and administrative expenses, and conditions imposed in connection with such approvals could adversely affect the rates that we are able to charge our customers. Our business also may be affected by legislation and regulation imposing new or greater obligations related to, for example, assisting law enforcement, bolstering homeland and cyber-security, protecting intellectual property rights of third parties, minimizing environmental impacts, protecting customer privacy, or addressing other issues that affect our business.\nOur operations require substantial capital expenditures, and if funds for capital expenditures are not available when needed, this could affect our service to customers and our growth opportunities.\nWe require substantial capital to maintain our network, and our growth strategy will require significant capital investments for network enhancements and build-out. During 2018, we incurred $820.2 million in total capital expenditures, including $37.6 million in incremental spend related to acquisitions. We expect to be able to fund required capital expenditures from cash generated from operations and borrowings under our DIP facilities. However, other risk factors described in this section, including relating the Chapter 11 Cases, could materially reduce cash available from operations or significantly increase our capital expenditure requirements. If this occurs, funds for capital expenditures may not be available when needed, which could affect our service to customers and our growth opportunities.\nDifficulties of operating while attempting to reorganize our businesses in bankruptcy may also make it more difficult to maintain our capital expenditures. As a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, we may experience collection issues with otherwise valid receivables of certain customers. Adverse resolution of these disagreements may impact our revenues and other costs of services, both prospectively and retroactively. It is too soon for us to predict with any certainty the ultimate impact of these disagreements. Many of our suppliers, vendors and service providers may require stricter terms and conditions, and we may not find these terms and conditions acceptable. In addition, we may continue to experience a loss of confidence by current and prospective suppliers, new and existing customers, landlords, employees or other stakeholders, which could make it more difficult for us to make capital expenditures and have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe level of returns on our pension plan investments and changes to the actuarial assumptions used to value our pension obligations could have a material effect on our earnings and result in material funding requirements to meet our pension obligations.\nOur pension plan invests in marketable securities, including marketable debt and equity securities denominated in foreign currencies, which are exposed to changes in the financial markets. During 2018, the fair market value of these investments decreased from $841.4 million to $740.9 million primarily due to investment losses of $41.1 million and routine benefit payments of $77.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by employer contributions of $18.5 million. Returns generated on plan assets have historically funded a large portion of the benefits paid under our pension plan.\nFunding requirements may increase as a result of a decline in the market value of plan assets, a decline in the interest rates used to calculate the present value of future plan obligations or government regulations that increase minimum funding requirements of the pension liability. We estimate that the long term rate of return on plan assets will be 7.0 percent, but returns below this estimate could significantly increase our contribution requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flows from operations. Also, reductions in discount rates and extensions of participant mortality rates directly increase our pension liability and expose us to greater funding obligations in the future. Our earnings reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) may also be adversely affected due to our method of accounting for pension costs, whereby we immediately recognize gains and losses resulting from the return on plan assets as well as other changes in actuarial assumptions impacting our discount rate and mortality estimates.\nCompetition in our consumer service areas could reduce our market share and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face intense competitive pressures in our consumer service areas. If we continue to lose consumer households as we have historically, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. During 2018, our consumer households declined 1.6 percent.\nSources of competition include, but are not limited to, wireless companies, cable television companies and other communications carriers. Many of our competitors, especially wireless and cable television companies, have advantages over us, including substantially larger operational and financial resources, larger and more diverse networks, less stringent regulation and superior brand recognition. For additional discussion regarding competition, see \u201cCompetition\u201d in Item 1.\nCable television companies have aggressively expanded in our consumer markets, offering voice and high-speed Internet services in addition to video services. Some of our customers have chosen to move to cable television providers for their voice, high-speed Internet and television bundles. Cable television companies are subject to less stringent regulations than our consumer operations. For more information, refer to the risk factor, \u201cOur competitors, especially cable television companies, in our consumer markets are subject to less stringent industry regulations.\u201d\nWireless competition has contributed to a reduction in our voice lines and generally has caused pricing pressure in the industry. Some customers have chosen to stop using traditional wireline phone service and instead rely solely on wireless service. We anticipate that this trend toward solely using wireless services will continue, particularly if wireless prices continue to decline and the quality of wireless services improves.\nCompetition in our consumer markets could affect our revenues and profitability in several ways, including accelerated consumer household loss, reductions by customers in usage-based services or shifts to less profitable services and a need to lower our prices or increase marketing expenses to stay competitive.\nIf we are prohibited from participating in government programs, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are the recipient of a material amount of end user revenue and government funding under various government programs and also serve as a government contractor for services for various state, local and federal agencies. Our failure to comply with the complex government regulations and statutes applicable to the programs, or the terms of one or more of our government contracts, could result in our being suspended or disbarred from future government programs for a significant period of time or result in harm to our reputation with the government and possible restriction from future government activities. While we have implemented compliance programs and internal controls that are reasonably designed to prevent misconduct and non-compliance relating to the government programs and contracting, we cannot eliminate the risk that our employees, partners or subcontractors may independently engage in such activities.\nIf we are suspended or debarred from government programs, or if our government contracts are terminated for any reason, we could suffer a significant reduction in expected revenue which could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results.\nNew technologies may affect our ability to compete in our consumer markets.\nWireless companies are aggressively developing networks using next-generation data technologies, which are capable of delivering high-speed Internet service via wireless technology to a larger geographic footprint. If these technologies continue to expand in availability and reliability, they could become a cost effective alternative to our high-speed Internet services. In addition, cable operators may be able to take advantage of certain technology to deploy faster broadband speeds more rapidly than Windstream.\nThese and other new and evolving technologies could result in greater competition for our voice and high-speed Internet services. If we cannot develop new services and products to keep pace with technological advances, or if such services and products are not widely embraced by our customers, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nCompetitors, especially cable television companies, in our consumer markets are subject to less stringent industry regulations, which could result in voice line and revenues losses in the future.\nCable television companies are generally subject to less stringent regulations than our consumer operations. Cable voice offerings and others are subject to fewer service quality and reporting requirements than our consumer operations, and their rates are generally not subject to regulation, unlike our consumer voice services. Our consumer areas also may be subject to \u201ccarrier of last resort\u201d obligations, which generally obligate us to provide basic voice services to any person within our service area regardless of the profitability of the customer. Our competitors in these areas are not subject to such requirements.\nBecause of these regulatory disparities, we have less flexibility in our consumer markets than our competitors. This could result in accelerated voice line and revenue losses in the future.\nIn 2018, we received approximately 5 percent of our revenues from state and federal USF, and any material adverse regulatory developments with respect to these funds could adversely affect our financial and operating condition.\nWe receive state and federal USF revenues to support the high cost of providing affordable telecommunications services in rural markets. Such support payments constituted approximately 5 percent of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. Pending regulatory proceedings to reform state and federal USF programs and our implementation of those reforms could, depending on the outcome, materially reduce our USF revenues and increase our expenses.\nThe FCC implemented the Connect America Fund, which was adopted in 2011 and includes a short-term (\u201cCAF Phase I\u201d) and a longer-term (\u201cCAF Phase II\u201d) framework. Windstream elected to participate in both programs. Currently, Windstream receives immaterial amounts of CAF Phase I funding in one state that is subject to being phased out at an undetermined future date. Furthermore, Windstream receives funds under the CAF Phase II program that is scheduled to end in 2021. If the CAF Phase II program is not extended by the FCC, or if a new similar program is not implemented beyond 2021 in which Windstream can participate, our financial and operating condition could be materially impaired.\nAdditionally, to obtain the available funding, which is greater than the amount Windstream received from the legacy federal universal service program, Windstream has committed to offer broadband to a certain number of locations at specified speeds in particular portions of its service areas. This will require substantial capital investment and large-scale construction by Windstream in rural and hard-to-serve geography. Costs of Phase II could exceed estimates by a material amount. The scale and scope of the network buildout to meet the obligations is challenging and complex. If Windstream is not able to fulfill its commitments, it would be required to return some funding and may be subject to additional penalties.\nWe are required to make contributions to state and federal USF programs each year. Most state and federal regulations allow us to recover these contributions by including a surcharge on our customers\u2019 bills. If state and/or federal regulations change, and we become ineligible to receive support, such support is reduced, or we become unable to recover the amounts we contribute to the state and federal USF programs from our customers, our results of operations and financial condition would be directly and adversely affected.\nWe have written off a portion of our goodwill and may be required to write off additional goodwill in the future, which may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our goodwill comprised 27.0 percent of our assets. Each year, and more frequently on an interim basis if appropriate, we are required by Accounting Standards Codification Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, to assess whether the amount of goodwill assigned to each of our reporting units is impaired. Significant judgments are required to estimate the fair value of reporting units including estimating future cash flows, near-term and long-term revenue growth, and determining appropriate discount rates, among other assumptions. Future impairment reviews could result in additional impairment charges. Any such impairment charges could materially adversely affect our financial results for the periods in which they are recorded. Additional impairment charges will likely result due to changes from various factors or circumstances, including adoption of new accounting standards, deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, deterioration in our performance or future projections as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases or otherwise, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Financial Supplement to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may need to defend ourselves against lawsuits or claims that we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.\nFrom time to time, we receive notices from third parties, or we are named in lawsuits filed by third parties, claiming we have infringed or are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. We may receive similar notices or be involved in similar lawsuits in the future. In certain situations, we may have the ability to seek indemnification from our vendors regarding these lawsuits or claims. If we cannot enforce our indemnification rights or if our vendors lack the financial means to indemnify us, these claims may require us to expend significant time and money defending our alleged use of the affected technology, may require us to enter into licensing agreements requiring one-time or periodic royalty payments that we would not otherwise have to pay or may require us to pay damages. If we are required to take one or more of these actions, it may result in an adverse impact to our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, in responding to these claims, we may be required to stop selling or redesign one or more of our products or services, which could adversely affect the way we conduct our business.\nWeak economic conditions may decrease demand for our services.\nWe could be affected by economic conditions and downturns in the economy, especially in regards to our business customers. Downturns in the economy in the markets we serve could cause our existing customers to reduce their purchases of our services and make it difficult for us to obtain new customers.\nOur relationships with other communications companies are material to our operations and their financial difficulties may adversely affect us.\nWe originate and terminate calls for long-distance and other voice carriers over our network in exchange for access charges. These access charges represent a significant portion of our revenues. Additionally, we are making significant capital investments to deploy fiber-to-the-tower and other network services in return for long-term revenue generating contracts. If these carriers go bankrupt or experience substantial financial difficulties and we are unable to timely collect payments from them, it may have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nKey suppliers may experience financial difficulties that may affect our operations.\nWindstream purchases a significant amount of equipment from key suppliers to maintain, upgrade and enhance our network facilities and operations. Should these suppliers experience financial difficulties, their issues could adversely affect our business through increased prices to source purchases through alternative vendors or unanticipated delays in the delivery of equipment and services purchased.\nAdverse developments in our relationship with our employees could adversely affect our business, our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had 1,340 employees, or approximately 11 percent of all of our employees, covered by collective bargaining agreements. Our relationship with these unions generally has been satisfactory.\nWe are currently party to 23 collective bargaining agreements and one National Pension Agreement with several unions, which expire at various times. Of our existing collective bargaining agreements, eight agreements covering approximately 500 employees are due to expire in 2019. In addition, the national pension agreement covers approximately 350 employees. This agreement expired in 2010 but has been extended indefinitely, subject to the right of Windstream or the unions to terminate the agreement with 30 days\u2019 notice. Historically, we have succeeded in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements without work stoppages; however, no assurances can be given that we will succeed in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements to replace the expiring ones without work stoppages. Increases in organizational activity or any future work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our business, our results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 91391, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "WINMQ"}
