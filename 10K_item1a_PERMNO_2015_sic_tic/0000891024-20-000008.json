RISK FACTORS\nThe risks described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and/or the trading price of our common stock. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations. You should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties. The order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority.\nThe dental and animal health supply markets are highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete successfully.\nOur competitors include national, regional and local full-service distributors, mail-order distributors and Internet-based businesses. Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do, or operate through different sales and distribution models that could allow them to compete more successfully. For example, many of our suppliers are manufacturers, some of whom compete with us by selling directly to customers. Internet-based businesses also sell direct to consumers, and may offer the same product at a lower cost.\nMost of our products are available from multiple sources, and our customers tend to have relationships with several different distributors who can fulfill their orders. If any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor such as technological advances or newer low-cost business models with the ability to operate at higher gross margins, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected. Increased competition from any supplier of dental or animal health products could adversely impact our financial results. Additional competitive pressure could arise from, among other things, limited demand growth or a significant number of additional competitive products or services being introduced into a particular market, the emergence of new competitors, the unavailability of products, price reductions by competitors, and the ability of competitors to capitalize on their economies of scale. Manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to end-users and thereby eliminate or reduce the role of distributors. These suppliers could sell their products at lower prices and maintain a higher gross margin on the product sales than we can. In addition, our ability to deliver market growth is challenged by an animal health product mix that is weighted toward lower growth, lower margin parts of the value chain. For example, our current product mix may hamper our ability to tap into specialty areas with strong procedural growth.\nIndustry consolidation has also adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our margins and product availability. There has been increasing consolidation among manufacturers as well as distributors, which could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by competitors, or as competitors with lower cost business models are able to operate with lower prices and gross profit on products. In addition, in recent years there has also been a trend towards consolidation in the industries that buy our products and services, including the consolidation of dental practices into larger clinics and dental service organizations, the consolidation of veterinary practices as well as producers, and the formation of group purchasing organizations, provider networks and buying groups designed to leverage volume discounts. We also face pricing pressure from branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. These competitive pressures could adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nWe may be unable to anticipate and effectively respond to competitive change, and our failure to compete effectively may limit and/or reduce our revenue, profitability and cash flow.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response thereto have adversely affected our results of operations and our financial condition, and the full impact of the pandemic will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nGlobal health concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic have been weighing on the macroeconomic environment, and the pandemic has significantly increased unemployment and economic uncertainty. Authorities have implemented numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and business shutdowns. These measures negatively impacted consumer spending and business spending habits, and they also adversely impacted and may further impact our financial results and the financial results of our customers, suppliers and business partners.\nIn particular, in March 2020, based upon the recommendations of the American Dental Association, the American Veterinary Medical Association and such organizations\u2019 state-level counterparts, various dental and veterinary offices announced that they were performing only emergency or limited procedures, and rescheduled wellness exams and other elective procedures. In addition, many states and countries imposed restrictions on business operations to protect public health. As of June 2020, these measures have been lifted in some areas that we serve, sometimes subject to social distancing and capacity restrictions. However, future closures may be mandated or recommended by health authorities in some states, cities, or counties depending on the progress of the pandemic. In addition, even if dental and veterinary offices are open for business in their area, some consumers may continue to delay elective visits. In addition, the pandemic has also negatively impacted consumer spending and business spending habits due to increased unemployment and economic uncertainty, all of which may become heightened concerns upon a second wave of infection or future developments.\nOther actual and potential impacts on us from the COVID-19 pandemic include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022Interruptions in the operations of industries in which our products are used, including production animal processing. We have experienced significant disruption and economic impact from closures of dental and veterinary offices, as discussed above. In addition, the interruption in meatpacking operations that occurred due to the pandemic factored into the full goodwill impairment of the animal health business in fiscal 2020.\n\u2022Limited supply of the personal protective equipment (PPE) necessary for dental practice. Supply chain disruptions for PPE and an increased demand for these products has resulted, and may continue to result, in backorders of PPE and a potential scarcity in raw materials to make PPE. Prices for PPE have also increased, and we have had to prepay suppliers in order to obtain PPE for resale to our customers. We may not be able to supply our customers with the quantity of PPE products they demand. Conversely, PPE demand could decrease suddenly upon an oversupply relative to demand, depending upon the course of the pandemic, which could impact our margins.\n\u2022Actual and potential delays in customer payments, defaults on our customer credit arrangements; or other failures by third parties such as suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors to meet their obligations to our company due to their economic circumstances. We have experienced delayed or deferred payments from customers as they, in turn, have been affected by the pandemic. This impacts our cash flow. There is no assurance when, or if, our customers will be able to resume pre-pandemic payment processes or we will be able to collect all deferred payments.\n\u2022Risks of remote work. Most of our corporate employees shifted abruptly to working remotely under stay-at-home orders imposed in March 2020. While such orders are beginning to lift, often subject to social distancing and capacity restrictions, there is no assurance that they will not be re-imposed or recommended in the future depending on the progression of the pandemic. Remote work arrangements could strain our business continuity plans, introduce operational risk, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks, and impair our ability to efficiently operate our business. In addition, our rapid transition to remote work arrangements for corporate employees could have exposed us to continuing cybersecurity risk.\n\u2022Adapting business practices. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices, particularly with respect to our liquidity position and near-term cost structure (including through incremental borrowings on our revolving credit facility to increase cash, reduction of non-critical capital expenditures,\nexecutive, board, and other senior-level employee compensation reductions, employee furloughs, discretionary spending deferrals and the deferral of payroll taxes under the CARES Act).\n\u2022Potential impact on our ability to meet obligations under credit facilities. The pandemic could impact our ability to meet our obligations under our amended credit agreement and other outstanding debt, which may require us to seek covenant relief for a limited period of time. Although there can be no assurance that such relief would be available, if such relief is available, our lenders may, in exchange, increase the cost of borrowing, apply more stringent covenants, restrict merger and acquisition activity, and require other terms and conditions that may limit our business and financing activities.\n\u2022Disruptions in the financial markets, which could affect our stock price, our ability to meet covenants under our credit agreement and other outstanding debt, or our ability to secure future debt at acceptable rates.\n\u2022Personnel resources. Mitigating the effects of COVID-19 has required, and will likely continue to require for the duration of the pandemic, a large investment of time and resources across our company, and may delay certain strategic and other plans which could materially adversely affect our business. Furthermore, we could be impacted by reduced availability of members of management or employees due to quarantine, illness or death.\n\u2022Reputational risk associated with response to COVID-19. If we do not respond appropriately to the COVID-19 pandemic, or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate, we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brands, which could materially adversely affect our business.\n\u2022Interruptions in manufacturing or distribution of our products. Outbreaks in the communities in which we operate could affect our ability to operate our manufacturing or distribution activities, and our suppliers could experience similar interruptions.\nThe full extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak within the U.S., Canada and the U.K., its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after COVID-19 has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. There are no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of COVID-19, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of COVID-19, or a similar health epidemic or pandemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our dental and animal health businesses, our operations or the global economy as a whole. However, the effects could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nOther events affecting general economic conditions could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur operating results and financial condition could also be materially affected by generally weak economic conditions in the U.S. or global economy, or an uncertain economic outlook, influenced by many other events and uncertainties including, among other things:\n\u2022changes to laws and policies governing foreign trade;\n\u2022greater restrictions on imports and exports;\n\u2022changes in laws and policies governing health care or data privacy;\n\u2022tariffs and sanctions;\n\u2022changes to laws and policies governing foreign trade (including, without limitation, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, and other international trade agreements);\n\u2022election results;\n\u2022sovereign debt levels;\n\u2022the inability of political institutions to effectively resolve actual or perceived economic, currency or budgetary crises or issues;\n\u2022consumer confidence;\n\u2022unemployment levels (and a corresponding increase in uninsured and underinsured population);\n\u2022changes in regulatory requirements and tax regulations;\n\u2022increases in interest rates;\n\u2022availability of capital;\n\u2022increases in fuel and energy costs;\n\u2022the effect of inflation on our ability to procure products and our ability to increase prices over time;\n\u2022changes in tax rates and the availability of certain tax deductions;\n\u2022increases in healthcare costs;\n\u2022the threat or outbreak of war, terrorism or public unrest, including but not limited to civil unrest in areas in which we have operations; and\n\u2022changes in laws and policies in countries where we do business.\nChanges in government, government debt and/or budget crises may lead to reductions in government spending in certain countries and/or higher income or corporate taxes, which could depress spending overall. In addition, recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending may cause customers to reduce, modify, delay, or cancel purchasing our products and services as we have experienced in the wake of COVID-19, and a prolonged period of economic instability could further reduce their ability to make payments. Furthermore, such conditions could cause our suppliers to reduce their production, decrease their number of product offerings, or change their terms of sale to us. Increasing commodity prices may also increase our cost of operations, either directly through increased energy costs or indirectly through what we are charged by our suppliers. Recessionary economic conditions could also cause changes in our product mix as our customers prioritize established, low-margin products rather than innovative, high-margin products, which could reduce our profit margin.\nBreaches of information systems security could damage our reputation, disrupt operations, increase costs and/or decrease revenues.\nWe collect and store confidential information from customers so that they may, among other things, purchase products or services, use our software or practice management systems, enroll in promotional programs, register on our websites, engage in data conversion or otherwise communicate or interact with us. We also acquire and retain information about suppliers, employees and others in the normal course of business. We may be unable to protect sensitive data and/or the integrity of our information security. In addition, compliance with evolving privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant additional expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. We could be subject to liability for failure to comply with these laws and standards, failure to protect information, or failure to respond appropriately to an incident or misuse of information, including use of information for unauthorized marketing purposes.\nOur credit agreement contains restrictive covenants and additional limits and our other debt instruments contain cross-default provisions, which limit our business and financing activities.\nThe pandemic could impact our ability to meet our obligations under our credit agreement and other outstanding debt, which may require us to seek covenant relief for a limited period of time. Although there can be no assurance that such relief would be available, if such relief is available, our lenders may, in exchange, increase the cost of borrowing, apply more stringent covenants, restrict merger and acquisition activity, and require other terms and conditions that may limit our business and financing activities.\nMore generally, the covenants under our existing credit agreement impose restrictions on our business and financing activities, subject to certain exceptions or the consent of our lenders, including, among other things, limits on our ability to incur additional debt, create liens, enter into merger, acquisition and divestiture transactions, pay dividends and engage in transactions with affiliates. The credit agreement contains certain customary affirmative covenants, including a requirement that we maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio, and customary events of default. The terms of agreements governing debt that we may incur in the future may also contain similar covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be adversely affected by events beyond our control, including economic, financial and industry conditions. A breach of the credit agreement covenants may result in an event of default, which could allow our lenders to terminate the commitments under the credit agreement, declare all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement (if any), together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable, and exercise other rights and remedies, and, through cross-default provisions, would entitle our other lenders to accelerate their loans. If this occurs, we may not be able to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all, or otherwise repay the accelerated indebtedness.\nWe are dependent on our relationships with our sales representatives, service technicians and our customers.\nThe inability to attract or retain qualified employees, particularly sales representatives and service technicians who relate directly with our customers, or our inability to build or maintain relationships with customers in the dental and animal health markets, may have an adverse effect on our business. Due to the specialized nature of many of our products and services, generally only highly qualified and trained personnel have the necessary skills to market such products and provide such services. These individuals develop relationships with our customers that could be damaged if these employees are not retained. We face intense competition for the hiring of these professionals, and many professionals in the field that may otherwise be attractive candidates for us to hire may be bound by non-competition agreements with our competitors. Any failure on our part to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified professionals would damage our business.\nWe may be unable to realize the long-term strategic benefits of our acquisition of Animal Health International, Inc.\nIn June 2015, we acquired Animal Health International, Inc. Achieving the targeted benefits of the acquisition will depend in part upon whether we can efficiently and effectively integrate Animal Health International, Inc.\u2019s businesses. The necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities and addressing differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration. We and Animal Health International, Inc. operate numerous systems, including those involving management information, purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, billing, and regulatory compliance. Moreover, the integration of our respective operations requires the dedication of significant management resources, which is likely to distract management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations. We may not be able to achieve the targeted long-term strategic benefits of the Animal Health International, Inc. acquisition. An inability to realize the full extent of, or any of, the anticipated benefits of the Animal Health International, Inc. acquisition, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDisruption to our distribution capabilities, including service issues with our third-party shippers, could materially adversely affect our results.\nWeather, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, pandemic, strikes, civil unrest, geopolitical events or other reasons could impair our ability to distribute our products and conduct our business. If we are unable to manage effectively such events if they occur, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Similarly, increases in service costs or service issues with our third-party shippers, including strikes or other service interruptions, could cause our operating expenses to rise and materially adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis. We ship almost all of our orders through third-party delivery services, and often times bear the cost of shipment. Our ability to provide same-day shipping and next-day delivery is an integral component of our business strategy and any significant increase in shipping rates or service interruptions could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business development efforts may suffer if we fail to provide our sales force and customers with the latest customer relationship and order management tools.\nDue to generational and other trends in the dental and animal health industries, our customer base is increasingly comfortable with and reliant upon the latest technologies to manage their businesses. As part of our commitment to providing superior customer service, we offer our customers computerized order entry, customer support for digital and proprietary products, including the Patterson Technology Center, customer-loyalty program reports and services, and access to articles and manufacturers\u2019 product information. We also provide real-time customer and sales information to our sales force, managers and vendors via the Internet to enable them to compete in the digital marketplace. Our business development efforts may suffer if we fail to keep pace with rapidly changing technologies and customer expectations.\nWe are dependent on our suppliers because we generally do not manufacture the products we sell.\nInterruptions in supply could adversely affect our operating results. If a supplier is unable to deliver product in a timely and efficient manner, whether due to financial difficulties, natural disasters, pandemics or other reasons, we could experience lost sales. We generally do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers that commit them to producing products for us and there is considerable concentration within our animal health and dental businesses\nwith a few key suppliers. In addition, because we generally do not control the actual production of the products we sell, we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control, including the failure to comply with applicable government requirements. The failure of manufacturers of products regulated by the FDA or other governmental agencies to meet these requirements, could result in product recall, cessation of sales or other market disruptions. An extended interruption in the supply of our products would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, a portion of our products is sourced, directly or indirectly, from countries outside the U.S. including China. Political or financial instability, increased tariffs, restrictions on trade, currency exchange rates, labor unrest, pandemics or other events could slow distribution activities, affect foreign trade beyond our control and adversely affect our results of operations.\nMaterial changes in our purchasing relationship with suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to sustain our gross profits depends, in part, on the structure of our relationship with our suppliers. Such relationships are subject to change from time to time, such as changing from a \u201cbuy/sell\u201d to an agency relationship, or from an agency to a \u201cbuy/sell\u201d relationship, either of which could adversely affect our revenues and operating income. Suppliers may also choose to change the method in which products are taken to market, including the possibility of creating or expanding a direct sales force or otherwise reducing their reliance on third-party distribution channels. For example, a supplier may change our relationship from a complete distribution provider, including logistics and sales support, to only a logistics provider, or to only a sales support provider, or it may decide to entirely terminate its business relationship with us. A reduction in our role as a value-added service provider would result in reduced margins on product sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSales of private label products entail additional risks, including the risk that such sales could adversely affect our relationships with suppliers.\nWe offer certain private label products that are available exclusively from us. The sale of such products subjects us to the risks generally encountered by entities that source, market and sell private label products, including but not limited to potential product liability risks, mandatory or voluntary product recalls, potential supply chain and distribution chain disruptions, and potential intellectual property infringement risks. Any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, an increase in the sales of our private label products may negatively affect our sales of products owned by our suppliers which, consequently, could adversely impact certain of our supplier relationships. Our ability to locate qualified, economically stable suppliers who satisfy our requirements, and to acquire sufficient products in a timely and effective manner, is critical to ensuring, among other things, that customer confidence is not diminished. As a distribution company, any failure to develop sourcing relationships with a broad and deep supplier base could adversely affect our financial performance and erode customer loyalty.\nPatterson\u2019s continued success is substantially dependent on positive perceptions of Patterson\u2019s reputation.\nOne of the reasons why customers choose to do business with Patterson and why employees choose Patterson as a place of employment is the reputation that Patterson has built over many years. To be successful in the future, Patterson must continue to preserve, grow and leverage the value of Patterson\u2019s brand. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities. Even an isolated incident, or the aggregate effect of individually insignificant incidents, can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, and as a result, could tarnish Patterson\u2019s brand and lead to adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks inherent in acquiring other businesses could offset the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions and we may face difficulty in efficiently and effectively integrating acquired businesses.\nAs a part of our business strategy, we have acquired businesses in the ordinary course and may continue acquiring businesses in the future, consistent with our obligations under our amended credit agreement. These acquisitions\ncan involve a number of risks and challenges, any of which could cause significant operating inefficiencies and adversely affect our growth and profitability, and may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect. Such risks and challenges include underperformance relative to our expectations and the price paid for the acquisition; unanticipated demands on our management and operational resources; difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and systems; retention of customers of the combined businesses; assumption of contingent liabilities; acquisition-related earnings charges; and acquisition-related cybersecurity risks.\nAs we operate through two strategic business units, we consolidate the distribution, information technology, human resources, financial and other administrative functions of those business units jointly to meet their needs while addressing distinctions in the individual markets of those segments. We may not be able to do so effectively and efficiently.\nOur ability to continue to make acquisitions will depend upon our success in identifying suitable targets, which requires substantial judgment in assessing their values, strengths, weaknesses, liabilities and potential profitability, as well as the availability of suitable candidates at acceptable prices, whether restrictions are imposed by anti-trust or other regulations, and compliance with the terms and conditions of our amended credit agreement.\nOur acquired technology or developed technology may not be successful in maintaining existing customers or gaining new customers, or the technology may fail to produce its intended results.\nThe process of acquiring or developing new technology products and solutions is inherently complex and uncertain. It requires accurate anticipation of customers\u2019 changing needs and emerging technological trends. We must make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in products or services that achieve customer acceptance and generate the revenue required to provide desired returns. If we fail to accurately anticipate and meet our customers\u2019 needs through the development of new products and technologies and service offerings or if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if our new products are not widely accepted or if our current or future products fail to meet applicable regulatory requirements, we could lose customers to our competitors and that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if technology investments do not achieve the intended results, we may write-off the investments, and we face the risk of claims from system users that the systems failed to produce the intended result or negatively affected the operation of our customers\u2019 businesses. Any such claims, even those without merit, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend, cause us to lose customers and the associated revenue, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, or require us to pay damages.\nWe are subject to a variety of litigation that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to a variety of litigation incidental to our business, including product liability claims, intellectual property claims, employment claims, commercial disputes, governmental inquiries and investigations, and other matters arising out of the ordinary course of our business, including antitrust and securities litigation. From time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of products. Additionally, purchasers of private-label products may seek recourse directly from us, rather than the ultimate product manufacturer, for product-related claims. Another potential risk we face in the distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit or tainted products infiltrating the supply chain. In addition, some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials. The improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us to liability. In addition, our reputation could be adversely affected by negative publicity surrounding such events regardless of whether or not claims against us are successful. Defending against such claims may divert our management\u2019s attention, may be expensive, and may require that we pay damage awards or settlements, pay fines or penalties, or become subject to equitable remedies (including but not limited to the revocation of or non-renewal of licenses) that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor example, as further disclosed under \u201cLitigation\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our subsidiary Animal Health International was recently the subject of an investigation by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Virginia, which resulted in Animal Health International pleading guilty to a strict-liability misdemeanor offense in connection with its failure to comply with federal law relating to the sales of prescription animal health products, and a total criminal fine and forfeiture of $52.8 million. In addition, Animal Health International and Patterson entered into a non-prosecution agreement for other non-compliant licensing, dispensing, distribution and related sales processes disclosed during the investigation and committed to undertake additional compliance program enhancements and\nprovide compliance certifications through fiscal 2023. We also may be subject to other fines or penalties, equitable remedies (including but not limited to the suspension, revocation or non-renewal of licenses) and litigation.\nA successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by insurance or indemnification agreements, or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation. Furthermore, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.\nChanges in consumer preferences away from food animal products could adversely affect our business.\nThe demand for food animal products is heavily dependent upon consumer demand for beef, dairy, poultry and swine. The food industry in general is subject to changing consumer trends, demands and preferences. Trends within the food industry change often and our failure to anticipate, identify or react to changes in these trends could lead to, among other things, reduced demand and price reductions for our animal health products, and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, even if we do anticipate and identify these trends, we may be unable to react effectively. For example, changes in consumer diets may negatively affect consumer demand for beef, dairy, poultry and/or swine, and therefore reduce the demand for our production animal health products which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, pandemic outbreaks and other factors can cause interruptions in animal processing, which increases costs to producers and may change their production of animals in the future. Pork shortages caused by closed processing plants due to COVID-19 also may have affected consumer behavior.\nFrom time to time, we also experience changes in customer and product mix that affect gross margin. Changes in customer and product mix result primarily from business acquisitions, changes in customer demand, customer acquisitions, selling and marketing activities and competition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain historical gross margins in the future.\nRegulatory restrictions and bans on the use of antibiotics and growth promotants in food animals, as well as changing market demand, could adversely affect our business.\nThere has been consumer concern and consumer activism with respect to additives (including, without limitation, antibiotics and growth promotants) used in the production of animal products, including growing consumer sentiment for proteins and dairy products produced without the use of antibiotics or other products intended to increase animal production. Negative press resulting from media or consumer advocacy groups, industry litigation, trade restrictions which could cause the loss of export markets, or other factors could adversely affect the public\u2019s perception of the industry as a whole, or lead to reluctance by consumers to buy protein or other products. Concern over the impact of growth promotants on animal welfare could result in the removal from the market of products in that category, adversely impacting our sales. In addition, consumer concern that the use of antibiotics and growth promotants in animal feed may lead to increased antibiotic resistance of human pathogens have resulted in increased regulation and changing market demand. Under the FDA\u2019s guidance and the related rule known as the Veterinary Feed Directive, the use of shared-class antibiotics in the water or feed of food-producing animals requires written authorization by a licensed veterinarian. The impact of changes in regulations and market preferences regarding the use of antibiotics in food animals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If there is an increased public perception that consumption of food derived from animals that utilize additives we distribute poses a risk to human health, there may be a further decline in the production of those food products and, in turn, our sales of those products. In addition, antibiotic resistance concerns may result in additional restrictions or bans, expanded regulations or public pressure to further reduce the use of antibiotics in food animals, or increased demand for antibiotic-free protein, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be directly and indirectly affected by the cyclicality of the livestock market, including the effect of poor or unusual weather conditions, that could reduce demand for the production animal products we distribute.\nPoor or unusual weather conditions can significantly affect the purchasing decisions of our production animal customers. The timing and quantity of rainfall are two of the most important factors in agricultural production. Drought can affect the availability and price of feed for livestock. Faced with a reduction in readily available feed or an increase in costs for such feed, our customers may decide to reduce herd size, which would ultimately decrease\nthe demand for the products we distribute, including micro feed ingredients, animal health products, dairy sanitation solutions, as well as the development and implementation of systems for feed, health, information and production animal management.\nThe outbreak of an infectious disease within either the production animal or companion animal population could have a significant adverse effect on our business and our results of operations.\nAn outbreak of disease affecting animals, such as foot-and-mouth disease, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, Newcastle disease, avian flu or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly referred to as \u201cmad cow disease,\u201d could result in the widespread destruction of affected animals and consequently result in a reduction in demand for animal health products. In addition, outbreaks of these or other diseases or concerns of such diseases could create adverse publicity that may have a material adverse effect on consumer demand for meat, dairy and poultry products, and, as a result, on our customers\u2019 demand for the products we distribute. It could also harm export markets for such products and lead to increased government regulation. The outbreak of a disease among the companion animal population which could cause a reduction in the demand for companion animals could also adversely affect our business.\nPressure from animal rights groups may subject us to additional costs to conform our practices to comply with developing standards or subject us to marketing costs to defend challenges to our current practices.\nThe utilization of animals in research and development and product commercialization is subject to increasing focus by animal rights activists. The activities of animal rights groups and other organizations that have protested animal based research and development programs or boycotted the products resulting from such programs could cause an interruption in our supply chain. The occurrence of material operational problems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse changes in supplier rebates could negatively affect our business.\nThe terms on which we purchase or sell products from many suppliers of animal health products may entitle us to receive a rebate based on the attainment of certain growth goals. Suppliers may reduce or eliminate rebates offered under their programs, or increase the growth goals or other conditions we must meet to earn rebates to levels that we cannot achieve. Increased competition either from generic or equivalent branded products could result in us failing to earn rebates that are conditioned upon achievement of growth goals. Additionally, factors outside of our control, such as customer preferences, consolidation of suppliers or supply issues, can have a material impact on our ability to achieve the growth goals established by our suppliers, which may reduce the amount of rebates we receive. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe experience fluctuations in quarterly financial results. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur business is subject to quarterly fluctuations. Quarterly results may be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022timing and amount of sales and marketing expenditures;\n\u2022timing of pricing changes offered by our suppliers;\n\u2022timing of the introduction of new products and services by our suppliers;\n\u2022changes in or availability of supplier contracts or rebate programs;\n\u2022supplier rebates based upon attaining certain growth goals;\n\u2022changes in the way suppliers introduce or deliver products to market;\n\u2022costs of developing new applications and services;\n\u2022our ability to correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;\n\u2022uncertainties regarding potential significant breaches of data security or disruptions of our information technology systems;\n\u2022regulatory actions, or government regulation generally;\n\u2022loss of sales representatives;\n\u2022costs related to acquisitions and/or integrations of technologies or businesses;\n\u2022costs associated with our self-insured insurance programs;\n\u2022general market and economic conditions, as discussed above, including pandemic or civil unrest as well as those specific to the supply and distribution industry and related industries;\n\u2022our success in establishing or maintaining business relationships;\n\u2022difficulties of manufacturers in developing and manufacturing products;\n\u2022product demand and availability, or product recalls by manufacturers;\n\u2022exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury;\n\u2022increases in shipping costs or service issues with our third-party shippers;\n\u2022fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies;\n\u2022goodwill impairment;\n\u2022changes in interest rates;\n\u2022restructuring costs;\n\u2022the adoption or repeal of legislation;\n\u2022changes in accounting principles; and\n\u2022litigation or regulatory judgments, fines, forfeitures, penalties, equitable remedies, expenses or settlements.\nAny change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly financial results to fluctuate. If our financial results do not meet market expectations, our stock price may decline.\nThe market price for our common stock may be highly volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock may be highly volatile. A variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022the publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022changes in our industry and competitors;\n\u2022changes in government, legislation and regulation;\n\u2022our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and prospects;\n\u2022stock repurchases;\n\u2022activism by any single large shareholder or combination of shareholders;\n\u2022any future issuances of our common stock, which may include primary offerings for cash, stock splits, issuances in connection with business acquisitions, issuances of restricted stock/units and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time;\n\u2022general market and economic conditions, including those discussed above; and\n\u2022the other factors discussed above that may impact our quarterly results.\nIn addition, the Nasdaq Stock Market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on Nasdaq. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action or derivative litigation has often been instituted against companies. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe formation of group purchasing organizations (\u201cGPOs\u201d), provider networks and buying groups may place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe formation of GPOs, provider networks and buying groups may shift purchasing decisions to entities or persons with whom we do not have a historical relationship. This may threaten our ability to compete effectively, which could in turn negatively impact our financial results. As a full-service distributor with business service capabilities, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete with price-oriented distribution models that more readily enable the pricing typically demanded by GPOs, provider networks and buying groups.\nIncreases in over-the-counter sales of companion animal products, or sales of companion animal products from non-veterinarian sources, could adversely affect our business.\nCompanion animal health products are becoming increasingly available to consumers at competitive prices from sources other than veterinarians, including human health product pharmacies, Internet pharmacies and big-box retailers, and consumers are increasingly seeking such alternatives sources of supply for their companion animal health products. Companion animal owners also could decrease their reliance on, and visits to, veterinarians as they rely more on online animal-health information and retailers that now offer basic veterinary services. Because we market our companion animal prescription products primarily through the veterinarian channel, any decrease in visits to and reliance on veterinarians could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, companion animal owners may substitute human health products for animal-health products if they deem human health products to be acceptable, lower-cost alternatives.\nOur international operations are subject to inherent risks that could adversely affect our operating results.\nThere are a number of risks inherent in foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, complex regulatory requirements, staffing and management complexities, import and export costs, other economic factors and political considerations, all of which are subject to unanticipated changes.\nOur foreign operations also expose us to foreign currency fluctuations. Because our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies will have an impact on our income. Currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we generally do not hedge translation exposure with respect to foreign operations.\nChange and uncertainty in the health care industry, including continued implementation of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the \u201cHealth Care Reform Law\u201d), could materially adversely affect our business.\nLaws and regulations affecting the health care industry in the U.S. have changed dramatically in recent years, and we expect that future and pending legislation, rulemaking, and court decisions on legal challenges to the Health Care Reform Law will further change the landscape. Foreign government authorities may also adopt reforms of their health systems. We cannot predict what further reform proposals, if any, will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us. The continued uncertain status of the Health Care Reform Law affects our ability to plan.\nRecently, there has been increased scrutiny on drug pricing and concurrent efforts to control or reduce drug costs by Congress, the President, and various states, including that several bills have been introduced on a federal level. Such legislation, if enacted, could have the potential to impose additional costs on our business.\nReporting and disclosure obligations under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act provisions of the Health Care Reform Law increase the cost of our regulatory compliance.\nThe Physician Payment Sunshine Act imposes annual reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers and distributors with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to covered recipients (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals), and for such manufacturers and distributors and for group purchasing organizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity. Under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with covered recipients such as physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals. We may also be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and some of these state laws, as well as the federal law, can be ambiguous. We are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers. Our compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on us.\nFailure to comply with existing and future U.S. and foreign laws and regulatory requirements, including those governing the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances, could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.\nOur business is subject to requirements under various local, state, federal and international laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and human cells, tissue and cellular and tissue-based products, also known as HCT/P products, and animal feed and supplements. Among other things, such laws, and the regulations promulgated thereunder:\n\u2022regulate the storage and distribution, labeling, packaging, handling, reporting, record keeping, introduction, manufacturing and marketing of drugs, HCT/P products and medical devices;\n\u2022subject us to inspection by the FDA and the DEA;\n\u2022regulate the storage, transportation and disposal of certain of our products that are considered hazardous materials;\n\u2022regulate the distribution and storage of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances;\n\u2022require us to advertise and promote our drugs and devices in accordance with applicable FDA requirements;\n\u2022require registration with the FDA and the DEA and various state agencies;\n\u2022require record keeping and documentation of transactions involving drug products;\n\u2022require us to design and operate a system to identify and report suspicious orders of controlled substances to the DEA;\n\u2022require us to manage returns of products that have been recalled and subject us to inspection of our recall procedures and activities; and\n\u2022impose reporting requirements if a pharmaceutical, HCT/P product or medical device causes serious illness, injury or death.\nBy way of example, we are required to hold valid DEA and state-level registrations and licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the Controlled Substances Act and its accompanying regulations governing the storage, sale, marketing and handling of controlled substances. Applicable federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations also may require us to meet various standards relating to, among other things, licensure or registration, sales and marketing practices, product integrity and supply tracking to the manufacturer of the product, personnel, privacy and security of health or other personal information, installation, maintenance and repair of equipment, and the importation and exportation of products. Our business is also subject to requirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations abroad.\nThe failure to comply with any of these regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations, could materially adversely affect our business. Allegations by a governmental body that we have not complied with these and future laws could have a material adverse effect on our business. If it is determined that we have not complied with these laws, we are potentially subject to penalties including warning letters, civil and criminal fines and penalties, mandatory recall of product, seizure of product and injunction, consent decrees, and suspension or limitation of product sale and distribution. If we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance, we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including fines and the loss of licenses. Non-compliance with government requirements could adversely affect our ability to participate in federal and state government health care programs, and damage our reputation.\nFor example, as further disclosed under \u201cLitigation\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our subsidiary Animal Health International was recently the subject of an investigation by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Virginia, which resulted in Animal Health International pleading guilty to a strict-liability misdemeanor offense in connection with its failure to comply with federal law relating to the sales of prescription animal health products, and a total criminal fine and forfeiture of $52.8 million. In addition, Animal Health International and Patterson entered into a non-prosecution agreement for other non-compliant licensing, dispensing, distribution and related sales processes disclosed during the investigation and committed to undertake additional compliance program enhancements and provide compliance certifications through fiscal 2023. This matter may continue to divert management's attention and cause us to suffer reputational harm. We also may be subject to other fines or penalties, equitable remedies (including but not limited to the suspension, revocation or non-renewal of licenses) and litigation. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPublic concern over the abuse of opioid medications in the U.S., including increased legal and regulatory action, could negatively affect our business.\nCertain governmental and regulatory agencies, as well as state and local jurisdictions, are focused on the abuse of opioid medications in the U.S. Federal, state and local governmental and regulatory agencies are conducting investigations of pharmaceutical manufacturers and other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors regarding the distribution of opioid medications.\nFor example, as disclosed in our prior periodic reports, two of our subsidiaries were added as co-defendants in civil litigation brought by private claimants against various manufacturers, distributors and retail pharmacies throughout\nthe U.S., which claimed that defendants \u201cbreached their legal duties under federal law to monitor, detect, investigate, refuse and report suspicious orders of prescription opiates,\u201d captioned In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation, MDL No. 2804, pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The subsidiaries, Patterson Logistics Services Inc. and Patterson Veterinary Supply, Inc., were voluntarily dismissed from this action without prejudice in January 2020. We may face similar civil claims or governmental investigations in the future.\nManaging legal proceedings and responding to government investigations is costly and involves a significant diversion of management attention. Such proceedings are unpredictable and may develop over lengthy periods of time. An adverse resolution of the pending litigation or any future lawsuits or investigations may involve substantial monetary penalties and could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud or other laws and regulations, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to federal and state (and similar foreign) health care fraud and abuse, referral and reimbursement laws and regulations. Some of these laws, referred to as \u201cfalse claims laws,\u201d prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payers and programs. Other laws, referred to as \u201canti-kickback laws,\u201d prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing, of items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs. Health care fraud measures may implicate, for example, our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, our pricing and incentive programs for physician and dental practices, and our practice management products that offer billing-related functionality.\nFailure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Also, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses. Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private regulators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs. In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities, increasing the risk of noncompliance.\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the confidentiality of sensitive personal information or standards in electronic health records or transmissions, we could be required to make significant changes to our products, or incur substantial fines, penalties or other liabilities.\nThe FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software and digital health products intended for use in health care settings, and has developed and continues to develop policies on regulating clinical decision support tools and other types of software as medical devices. Certain of our software and related products support practice management, and it is possible that the FDA or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is subject to regulation as a medical device, which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products.\nOur practice management products include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health, clinical, financial and other sensitive information of individuals. These information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and malicious attack, which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns, and could involve claims against us by private parties and/or governmental agencies. For example, we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information, such as HIPAA. HIPAA requires, among other things, the implementation of various recordkeeping, operational, notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information, limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to breach of contract claims, substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation. Also, evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information, or could require us to incur\nsignificant additional costs to re-design our products in a timely manner to reflect these legal requirements, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOther health information standards, such as regulations under HIPAA, establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic transactions, such as transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers. Certain of our electronic practice management products must meet these requirements. Failure to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims, substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.\nWe also sell products and services that health care providers use to store and manage patient medical or dental records. These customers, and we are subject to laws, regulations and industry standards, such as HIPAA and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which require the protection of the privacy and security of those records, and our products may be used as part of these customers\u2019 comprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws. Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products or services to comply with applicable legal or contractual data privacy or security requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation.\nFinally, we are also subject to non-healthcare-specific requirements of the countries and states in which we operate which govern the handling, storage, use and protection of personal information, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which is a state statute intended to enhance privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California, and the pan-European General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR.\nBoth in the U.S. and abroad, these laws and regulations continue to evolve and remain subject to significant change. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain. If we fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we could be required to make significant changes to our products or services, or incur substantial fines, penalties, or other liabilities. For example, if legislation or regulations are adopted, interpreted or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent with our current business practices and that require changes to these practices, the design of the products and services we distribute or privacy practices, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The costs of compliance with, and the other burdens imposed by, new or existing laws or regulatory actions may prevent us from selling the products or services we distribute, or increase the costs of doing so, and may affect our decision to distribute such products or services. In addition, a determination by a court or government agency that any of our practices do not meet these standards could result in liability or negative publicity, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks generally associated with our information systems and cyber-security attacks could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely on information systems (\u201cIS\u201d) in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and store customer, product, supplier, and employee data to, among other things:\n\u2022facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items through numerous fulfillment centers;\n\u2022receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;\n\u2022accurately bill and collect from thousands of customers;\n\u2022process payments to suppliers; and\n\u2022provide products and services that maintain certain of our customers\u2019 electronic medical or dental records (including protected health information of their human patients).\nAs the breadth and complexity of our IS continue to grow, we will increasingly be exposed to the risks inherent in the development, integration and ongoing operation of evolving information systems (including third-party systems we rely on), including:\n\u2022disruption, impairment or failure of data centers, telecommunications facilities or other key infrastructure platforms;\n\u2022security breaches of, cyberattacks on and other failures or malfunctions in our critical application systems or their associated hardware; and\n\u2022excessive costs, excessive delays or other deficiencies in systems development and deployment.\nOur IS are vulnerable to natural disasters, power losses, computer viruses, telecommunication failures and other problems. In addition, information security risks have generally increased in recent years. Increased IS security threats and more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats, pose a potential risk to the security of our IS, customers and other business partners, as well as the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data, customers and other business partners. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, as cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber threats might defeat the measures that we or our vendors take to anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate such threats. Certain techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, introduce malicious software, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. These data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information could compromise intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. Cyber-attacks could also cause us to incur significant remediation costs, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. A cyber-security attack that bypasses our IS security causing an IS security breach may lead to a material disruption of our IS and/or the loss of business information, which could adversely affect our business. These risks may include, among others, the following:\n\u2022future results could be adversely affected due to the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property;\n\u2022operational or business delays resulting from the disruption or damage of IS and subsequent clean-up and mitigation activities, including our ability to process orders, maintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable and disburse funds;\n\u2022negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our customers, suppliers or industry peers; and\n\u2022lawsuits for, or regulatory proceedings relating to, a breach of personal financial and health information belonging to our customers and their patients.\nThe materialization of any of these risks may impede the processing of data and the day-to-day management of our business and could result in the corruption, loss or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary, confidential or other data. Disaster recovery plans, where in place, might not adequately protect us in the event of a system failure. Despite any precautions we take, damage from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins and similar events at our various computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to our servers.\nWe also increasingly rely upon server- and Internet-based technologies to run our business and to store our data as well as our customers\u2019 data. The use of such technologies may carry additional cyber-security risks relative to those posed by legacy technologies. Our Internet-based services also depend on our ability and the ability of our customers access the Internet. In the event of any difficulties, outages or delays by Internet service providers, we may be impeded from providing such services, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation.\nOur results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected if our IS are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events, are subject to cyber-security attacks, or fail for any extended period of time. If our business continuity plans do not provide effective alternative processes on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct our operations, which may adversely affect our business. We may need to expend additional resources in the future to continue to protect against, or to address problems caused by, any business interruptions or data security breaches.\nThe products we sell are subject to market and technological obsolescence; our software products may contain undetected errors or bugs when released.\nSome of the products we distribute are subject to technological obsolescence outside of our control, since we do not manufacture the majority of the products we sell. If our customers discontinue purchasing a given product, we might\nhave to record expense related to the diminution in value of inventories we have in stock, and depending on the magnitude, that expense could adversely impact our operating results.\nFurthermore, we cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software, software enhancements, or e-services, or that such software, software enhancements and e-services will be released on time or accepted by the market. Our software and applicable e-services products, like software products generally, may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced, or as new versions are released. We cannot be sure that future problems with post-release software errors or bugs will not occur. Any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software, as well as our reputation. We do not have any patents on our software or e-services, and rely upon copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as contractual and common-law protections. We cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our software or e-services products.\nVolatility in the financial markets could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nVolatility and other disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect the cost and availability of credit to us, as well as the cost of, and ability to sell, finance contracts we receive from customers to outside financial institutions. Reduced access to capital for our customers limits the amount of investment that they can make in their businesses, and with limited investment by the customer, our revenue from equipment sales could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to make payments on our debt obligations depends on our performance.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on, or refinance, our debt obligations depends on our operational and financial performance, which is subject to general economic, financial market, competitive, regulatory and other conditions and the interest rate environment that are beyond our control. If our performance were to suffer, our access to the capital necessary to run our business may become limited.\nRecent significant changes to our executive leadership team and any future loss of members of such team, and the resulting management transitions might harm our future operating results.\nIn recent fiscal years, we have experienced significant changes in our senior leadership team. If we experience additional departures, they could be particularly disruptive in light of difficult market conditions, could significantly delay, prevent the achievement of, or make it more difficult for us to pursue and execute on our business objectives, and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. If we are unable to mitigate these or other similar risks, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur future success depends on our leadership development and succession planning.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to recruit skilled personnel and then train our personnel to support the long-term growth of our business. While our Board of Directors and management actively monitor our succession plans and processes, our business could suffer if we lose key personnel unexpectedly. In addition, competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel.\nWe may experience significant disruptions in our operations resulting from our enterprise resource planning system.\nWe depend on our information technology systems and our financial shared services for the efficient functioning of our business, including accounting, billing, data storage, purchasing and inventory management. In addition, we have implemented an enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system across certain significant operating locations to support our operations. The operation of this ERP system requires the investment of human and financial resources. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenses as we continue to enhance and develop our ERP system. As a result of our ERP system, we may encounter difficulties in operating our business, which could disrupt our operations, including our ability to timely ship and track customer orders, determine inventory requirements, manage our supply chain, manage customer billing and otherwise adequately service our customers, and lead to increased costs and other difficulties. If we experience significant disruptions resulting from our ERP\nsystem, such events may disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our entire operation and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.\nOur business could be negatively adversely affected as a result of shareholder activism.\nWe could face adverse consequences as a result of the actions of activist investors. Campaigns by shareholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short-term shareholder value through actions such as financial restructuring, increased debt, special dividends, stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company. Responding to shareholder activism or engaging in a process or proxy contest may be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our management team and our employees from executing our business plan, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn fiscal 2020, we recorded impairment charges that eliminated our Animal Health segment\u2019s goodwill, and we may be required in the future to record a significant charge to earnings if our Dental segment\u2019s goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired.\nOur balance sheet includes goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. We recorded a $269.0 million non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge in our Animal Health segment as part of management\u2019s annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests using the beginning of our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter as the valuation date. Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we tested our goodwill for impairment again in April 2020 and recorded an additional $406.1 million non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of our Animal Health reporting unit\u2019s goodwill, based on management\u2019s estimates of future cash flows, driven by reduced sales volumes, as well as reduced EBITDA multiples of comparable companies. As of April 25, 2020, our Animal Health reporting unit had no remaining goodwill as a result of the total goodwill impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 of $675.1 million. If future impairment of our Dental segment\u2019s goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets is determined, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the period of such determination under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nAudits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods, and tax legislation could materially adversely affect our financial results and tax liabilities.\nThe amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments, as well as foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could materially adversely affect our tax positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be materially adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives. In December 2017, the U.S. government enacted legislation referred to as the Tax Act, which significantly revises the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The legislation is unclear in certain respects and will require the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) to issue regulations and interpretations, and possibly technical corrections. While there can be no assurance as to the impact of any additional guidance by the IRS, or of any guidance that may be issued by the SEC or the Financial Accounting Standards Board relating to the Tax Act, we have completed our accounting for the law change based on management\u2019s current interpretation of the new legislation.\nIn addition, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, they can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.\nWe are exposed to the risk of changes in interest rates.\nOur balance sheet includes certain non-current assets that are sensitive to movements in short-term interest rates. The variable rates are comprised of both LIBOR and commercial paper rates plus a spread and reset on certain dates, as set forth in the respective agreements. In addition, our balance sheet includes fixed rate long-term debt, whose fair value could be adversely affected by movements in interest rates. We finance purchases by our customers using finance contracts that are issued at fixed interest rates, and sell these contracts under various\nfunding arrangements that are priced using variable interest rates. Sudden and dramatic changes in the interest rates within relevant markets could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, changes in the method of determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates on our current or future assets and debt and may otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur governing documents, other documents to which we are a party, and Minnesota law may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests.\nAnti-takeover provisions of our articles of incorporation, bylaws, and Minnesota law could diminish the opportunity for shareholders to participate in acquisition proposals at a price above the then current market price of our common stock. For example, while we have no present plans to issue any preferred stock, our Board of Directors, without further shareholder approval, may issue up to approximately 30 million shares of undesignated preferred stock and fix the powers, preferences, rights and limitations of such class or series, which could adversely affect the voting power of our common stock. Further, as a Minnesota corporation, we are subject to provisions of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, or MBCA, regarding \u201ccontrol share acquisitions\u201d and \u201cbusiness combinations.\u201d We may, in the future, consider adopting additional anti-takeover measures. The authority of our Board of Directors to issue undesignated preferred stock and the anti-takeover provisions of the MBCA, as well as any future anti-takeover measures adopted by us, may, in certain circumstances, delay, deter or prevent takeover attempts and other changes in control of our company not approved by our Board of Directors.\nIn addition, our Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan provides that awards issued under that plan are fully vested and all restrictions on the awards lapse in the event of a change in control, as defined in such plan. Additionally, our Capital Accumulation Plan provides that on an event of acceleration, as defined in the plan, the restrictions on shares of restricted stock lapse and such stock becomes fully vested. An event of acceleration occurs if (a) a person has acquired a beneficial ownership interest in 30% or more of the voting power of our company, (b) a tender offer is made to acquire 30% or more of our company, (c) a solicitation subject to Rule 14a-11 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 relating to the election or removal of 50% or more of our Board of Directors occurs, or (d) our shareholders approve a merger, consolidation, share exchange, division or sale of our company\u2019s assets. Furthermore, if the surviving or acquiring company in a change in control does not assume our company\u2019s outstanding incentive awards or provide for their equivalent substitutes, our Amended and Restated 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan provides for accelerated vesting of incentive awards following a change in control upon the termination of the employee\u2019s service and in certain other circumstances, provided such event occurs within two years of a change in control.", "PERMNO": 78034, "SIC": 5047, "TIC": "PDCO"}
