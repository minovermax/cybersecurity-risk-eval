Risk Factors\nLike other financial and bank holding companies, we are subject to a number of risks, many of which are outside of our control. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be harmed. These risks are not the only ones that we may face. Other risks of which we are not aware, including those which relate to the banking and financial services industry in general and us in particular, or those which we do not currently believe are material, may harm our future business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Readers should consider carefully the following important factors in evaluating us, our business and an investment in our securities.\nRisks Relating to the Market and Our Business\nContinued or worsening general business and economic conditions could materially and adversely affect us.\nIn recent years, the U.S. economy has faced a severe economic crisis including a major recession from which it is slowly recovering. Business activity across a wide range of industries and regions in the U.S. remains reduced and local governments and many businesses continue to experience financial difficulty. While reflecting some improvement, unemployment levels remain elevated nationwide. There can be no assurance that these conditions will continue to improve and these conditions could worsen. In addition, on-going federal budget negotiations, the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the level of U.S. debt may have a destabilizing effect on financial markets.\nOur financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where we operate in Montana, Wyoming and South Dakota and in the United States as a whole. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment, natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.\nOverall, during recent years, the business environment has been adverse for many households and businesses in the United States and worldwide. While economic conditions in Montana, Wyoming and South Dakota, the United States and worldwide have improved since the recession, there can be no assurance that this improvement will continue. Economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding continuing economic improvement may result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing and savings habits. Such conditions could adversely affect the credit quality of our loans and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur significant credit losses, particularly in light of recent and existing market conditions.\nWe take on credit risk by virtue of making loans and extending loan commitments and letters of credit. Our credit standards, procedures and policies may not prevent us from incurring substantial credit losses, particularly in light of market developments in recent years. Weakening economic conditions, increasing unemployment rates and/or deterioration of housing markets could exert pressure on our loan customers resulting in higher delinquencies, repossession and losses, which would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAdverse economic conditions affecting Montana, Wyoming and western South Dakota could harm our business.\nOur customers are located predominantly in Montana, Wyoming and western South Dakota. Because of the concentration of loans and deposits in these states, existing or future adverse economic conditions in Montana, Wyoming or western South Dakota could cause us to experience higher rates of loss and delinquency on our loans than if the loans were more geographically diversified. Adverse economic conditions, including inflation, recession and unemployment and other factors, such as regulatory or business developments, natural disasters, environmental contamination and other unfavorable conditions and events that affect these states, could reduce demand for credit or fee-based products and may delay or prevent borrowers from repaying their loans. Adverse conditions and other factors identified above could also negatively affect real estate and other collateral values, interest rate levels and the availability of credit to refinance loans at or prior to maturity. These results could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMuch of the economic improvement in our market areas is due to the oil and gas drilling and production in the Bakken Formation. Decreased market oil prices have compressed margins for oil producers as well as oilfield service providers, energy equipment manufacturers and transportation suppliers, among others. A prolonged period of low oil prices or other events that may result in a decline in drilling activity could have a negative impact on the economies of our market areas and on our customers, which could could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to lending risk.\nThere are inherent risks associated with our lending activities. These risks include, among other things, the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate as well as those across Montana, Wyoming, western South Dakota and the United States. Increases in interest rates and/or weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans. We are also subject to various laws and regulations that affect our lending activities. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment of significant civil money penalties against us.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had $2.4 billion of commercial loans, including $1.6 billion of commercial real estate loans, representing approximately 49% of our total loan portfolio. These loans are often larger and involve greater risks than other types of lending. Because payments on such loans are often dependent on the successful operation or development of the property or business involved, repayment of such loans is more sensitive than other types of loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the general economy. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrowers' ability to make repayment from their employment and other income and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial loans typically are made on the basis of the borrowers' ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the commercial venture. If the cash flow from business operations is reduced, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Due to the larger average size of each commercial loan as compared with other loans such as residential loans, as well as the collateral which is generally less readily-marketable, losses incurred on a small number of commercial loans could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, at December 31, 2014, we had $1.6 billion of agricultural, construction, residential and other real estate loans, representing approximately 32% of our total loan portfolio. Deterioration in economic conditions or in the real estate market could result in increased delinquencies and foreclosures and could have an adverse effect on the collateral value for many of these loans and on the repayment ability of many of our borrowers. Deterioration in economic conditions or in the real estate market could reduce the number of loans we make to businesses in the construction and real estate industry, which could negatively impact our interest income and results of operations. Similarly, the occurrence of a natural or manmade disaster in our market areas could impair the value of the collateral we hold for real estate secured loans. Any one or a combination of the factors identified above could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we experience loan losses in excess of estimated amounts, our earnings will be adversely affected.\nThe risk of credit losses on loans varies with, among other things, general economic conditions, the type of loan being made, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and, in the case of a collateralized loan, the value and marketability of the collateral for the loan. We maintain an allowance for loan losses based upon, among other things, historical experience, an evaluation of economic conditions and regular reviews of loan portfolio quality. Based upon such factors, our management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectability of our loan portfolio and provides an allowance for loan losses. These assumptions and judgments are complex and difficult to determine given the significant uncertainty surrounding future conditions in the general economy and banking industry. If management's assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect and the allowance for loan losses is inadequate, or if the banking authorities or regulations require us to increase the allowance for loan losses, our earnings, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be significantly and adversely affected.\nOur goodwill may become impaired, which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition and may limit our Bank's ability to pay dividends to us, thereby causing liquidity issues.\nThe excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets from acquisitions, or goodwill, is evaluated for impairment at least annually and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is likely impairment has occurred. In testing for impairment, the fair value of net assets is estimated based on analyses of our market value, discounted cash flows and peer values. Consequently, the determination of the fair value of goodwill is sensitive to market-based economics and other key assumptions. Variability in market conditions or in key assumptions could result in impairment of goodwill, which is recorded as a noncash adjustment to income. An impairment of goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2014, we had goodwill of $206 million, or 23% of our total stockholders' equity. Furthermore, an impairment of goodwill could cause our Bank to be unable to pay dividends to us. If our Bank is unable to pay dividends to us, our cash flow and liquidity would be reduced. See below \u201cOur Bank's ability to pay dividends to us is subject to regulatory limitations, which, to the extent we are not able to receive such dividends, may impair our ability to grow, pay dividends, cover operating expenses and meet debt service requirements.\u201d\nWe may be unable to manage our growth due to acquisitions, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nAcquisitions of other banks and financial institutions involve risks of changes in results of operations or cash flows, unforeseen liabilities relating to the acquired institution or arising out of the acquisition, asset quality problems of the acquired entity and other conditions not within our control, such as adverse employee relations, loss of customers because of change of identity, deterioration in local economic conditions and other risks affecting the acquired institution. In addition, the process of integrating acquired entities will divert significant management time and resources. We may not be able to integrate successfully or operate profitably any financial institutions we may acquire. We may experience disruption and incur unexpected expenses in integrating acquisitions. There can be no assurance that any such acquisitions will enhance our cash flows, business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects and such acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, particularly during periods in which the acquisitions are being integrated into our operations.\nWe may not continue to have access to low-cost funding sources.\nWe depend on checking and savings, negotiable order of withdrawal, or NOW, and money market deposit account balances and other forms of customer deposits as our primary source of funding. Such account and deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return trade-off. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, we could lose a relatively low cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income.\nChanges in interest rates could negatively impact our net interest income, may weaken demand for our products and services or harm our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also adversely affect (1) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (2) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, including mortgage servicing rights, (3) our ability to realize gains on the sale of assets and (4) the average duration of our mortgage-backed investment securities\nportfolio. An increase in interest rates may reduce customers' desire to borrow money from us as it increases their borrowing costs and may adversely affect the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans which may lead to an increase in non-performing assets and a reduction of income recognized, which could harm our results of operations and cash flows. Further, because many of our variable rate loans contain interest rate floors, as market interest rates begin to rise, the interest rates on these loans may not increase correspondingly. In contrast, decreasing interest rates have the effect of causing customers to refinance mortgage loans faster than anticipated. This causes the value of assets related to the servicing rights on mortgage loans sold to be lower than originally recognized. If this happens, we may need to write down our mortgage servicing rights assets faster, which would accelerate expense and lower our earnings. Any substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. If the current low interest rate environment continues for a prolonged period, our interest income could decrease, adversely impacting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are dependent upon the services of our management team and directors.\nOur future success and profitability is substantially dependent upon the management skills of our executive officers and directors, many of whom have held officer and director positions with us for many years. We do not currently have employment agreements or non-competition agreements with any of our key executives. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in retaining these key employees or finding and integrating suitable successors in the event of their loss or unavailability.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees to operate our business effectively.\nThere is substantial competition for qualified personnel in our markets. Although unemployment rates have been declining in Montana and Wyoming, and the surrounding region, it may still be difficult to attract and retain qualified employees at all management and staffing levels. Failure to attract and retain employees and maintain adequate staffing of qualified personnel could adversely impact our operations and our ability to execute our business strategy. Furthermore, relatively low unemployment rates in certain of our markets, compared with national unemployment rates, may lead to significant increases in salaries, wages and employee benefits expenses as we compete for qualified, skilled employees, which could negatively impact our results of operations and prospects.\nWe are subject to significant governmental regulation and new or changes in existing regulatory, tax and accounting rules and interpretations could significantly harm our business.\nThe financial services industry is extensively regulated. Federal and state banking regulations are designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers, not to benefit a financial company's stockholders. These regulations may impose significant limitations on operations. The significant federal and state banking regulations that affect us are described in this report under the heading \u201cRegulation and Supervision.\u201d These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, employment, monetary and other laws and regulations, rules, standards, policies and interpretations control the methods by which we conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance and govern financial reporting and disclosures. These laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies and interpretations are undergoing significant review and changes, particularly given the recent market developments in the banking and financial services industries and the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act in July 2010.\nOther changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or supervisory guidance, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, policies, or supervisory guidance, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by Federal or state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage. In this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, are pursuing aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers, and systems failures or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers. We outsource many of our major systems, such as certain data processing, loan servicing and deposit processing systems. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience disruptions if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or disruption could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to risks related to cyber-security.\nOur computer systems and network infrastructure could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities or identity theft. Financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means.\nIn addition, we provide our customers with the ability to bank remotely, including online, mobile and over the telephone. The secure transmission of confidential information over the internet and other remote channels is a critical element of remote banking. Our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other internal and external security breaches. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other possible liabilities.\nDespite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks, nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications.\nFurther, targeted social engineering attacks may be sophisticated and difficult to prevent and our employees, customers or other users of our systems may be fraudulently induced to disclose sensitive information, allowing cyber criminals to gain access to our data or data of our customers.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences, including significant disruption of operations, misappropriation of confidential information, or damage to our computers or systems or those of our customers and counterparties. A successful security breach could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, significant litigation exposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe resolution of pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular period.\nWe face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remains high. Legal liability against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause harm to our reputation, which in turn could adversely impact our business prospects.\nThe status of recent lender liability litigation is included in \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Commitments and Contingencies,\" included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report. Although we maintain litigation reserves related to this case, the ultimate resolution of the matter, if unfavorable, may be material to our results of operations for a particular reporting period.\nWe are subject to liquidity risks.\nLiquidity is the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. Our liquidity is used to make loans and to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers. Potential alternative sources of liquidity include federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements. We maintain a portfolio of investment securities that may be used as a secondary source of liquidity to the extent the securities are not pledged for collateral. Other potential sources of liquidity include the sale of loans, the utilization of available government and regulatory assistance programs, the ability to acquire national market, non-core deposits, the issuance of additional collateralized borrowings such as Federal Home Loan Bank, or FHLB, advances, the issuance of debt securities, issuance of equity securities and borrowings through the Federal Reserve's discount window. Without sufficient liquidity from these potential sources, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers.\nAdditionally, our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors specific to us, the financial services industry or the economy in general. Factors that could reduce our access to liquidity sources include a downturn in our local or national economies, difficult or illiquid credit markets or adverse regulatory actions against us. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may become liable for environmental remediation and other costs on repossessed properties, which could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. If hazardous or toxic substances are found on these properties, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property's value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur systems of internal operating controls may not be effective.\nWe establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide us with critical information used to manage our business. These systems are subject to various inherent limitations, including cost, judgments used in decision-making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error and the risk of fraud. Moreover, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. Because of these limitations, any system of internal operating controls may not be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management. From time to time, control deficiencies and losses from operational malfunctions or fraud have occurred and may occur in the future. Any future deficiencies, weaknesses or losses related to internal operating control systems could have an adverse effect on our business and, in turn, on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe face significant competition from other financial institutions and financial services providers.\nWe face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources, higher lending limits and larger branch networks. Such competitors primarily include national, regional and community banks within the various markets we serve. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Increased competition among financial services companies due to the recent consolidation of certain competing financial institutions and the conversion of certain investment banks to bank holding companies may adversely affect our ability to market our products and services. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic funds transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets;\n\u2022\nthe ability to expand our market position;\n\u2022\nthe scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;\n\u2022\nthe rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\ncustomer satisfaction with our level of service; and\n\u2022\nindustry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations rely on certain external vendors.\nWe are reliant upon certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations. In addition, we are subject to certain long-term vendor contracts that limit our flexibility and increase our dependence on third party vendors. Failure of certain external vendors to perform in accordance with contractual arrangements could be disruptive to our operations and limit our ability to provide certain products and services demanded by our customers, which could have material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties. For example, we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to increased credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client.\nWe may not effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to use technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur Bank's ability to pay dividends to us is subject to regulatory limitations, which, to the extent we are not able to receive such dividends, may impair our ability to grow, pay dividends, cover operating expenses and meet debt service requirements.\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank, our only bank subsidiary. Since we are a holding company with no significant assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries, we depend upon dividends from the Bank for a substantial part of our revenue. Accordingly, our ability to grow, pay dividends, cover operating expenses and meet debt service requirements depends primarily upon the receipt of dividends or other capital distributions from the Bank. The Bank's ability to pay dividends to us is subject to, among other things, its earnings, financial condition and need for funds, as well as federal and state governmental policies and regulations applicable to us and the Bank, which limit the amount that may be paid as dividends without prior approval. For example, in general, the Bank is limited to paying dividends that do not exceed the current year net profits together with retained earnings from the two preceding calendar years unless the prior consents of the Montana and federal banking regulators are obtained.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to claims and litigation pertaining to our fiduciary responsibilities.\nSome of the services we provide, such as trust and investment services, require us to act as fiduciaries for our customers and others. From time to time, third parties make claims and take legal action against us pertaining to the performance of our fiduciary responsibilities. If these claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, we may be exposed to significant financial liability and/or our reputation could be damaged. Either of these results may adversely impact demand for our products and services or otherwise have a harmful effect on our business and, in turn, on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur dividend policy may change.\nAlthough we have historically paid dividends to our stockholders, we have no obligation to continue doing so and may change our dividend policy at any time without notice to our stockholders. Holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such cash dividends as our board of directors, or Board, may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Furthermore, consistent with our strategic plans, growth initiatives, capital availability, projected liquidity needs and other factors, we have made and adopted and will continue to make and adopt, capital management decisions and policies that could adversely impact the amount of dividends paid to our stockholders.\nAn investment in our Class A common stock is not an insured deposit.\nOur Class A common stock is not a bank savings account or deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or any other public or private entity. As a result, holders of our common stock could lose some or all of their investment.\nOur Class A common stock share price could be volatile and could decline.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock is volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nprevailing market conditions;\n\u2022\nour historical performance and capital structure;\n\u2022\nestimates of our business potential and earnings prospects;\n\u2022\nan overall assessment of our management;\n\u2022\nour Class B shareholders may convert their shares into Class A common stock and liquidate their holdings; and\n\u2022\nthe consideration of these factors in relation to market valuation of companies in related businesses.\nAt times the stock markets, including the NASDAQ Stock Market, on which our Class A common stock is listed, may experience significant price and volume fluctuations. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock is likely to be similarly volatile and investors in our Class A common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources.\nHolders of the Class B common stock have voting control of our company and are able to determine virtually all matters submitted to stockholders, including potential change in control transactions.\nMembers of the Scott family control in excess of 79% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Due to their holdings of common stock, members of the Scott family are able to determine the outcome of virtually all matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our articles of incorporation (except when a class vote is required by law), any merger or consolidation requiring common stockholder approval and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Accordingly, such holders have the ability to prevent change in control transactions as long as they maintain voting control of the company.\nIn addition, because these holders will have the ability to elect all of our directors they will be able to control our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our common stock or other securities, the payments of dividends on our common stock and entering into extraordinary transactions, and their interests may not in all cases be aligned with your interests. Further, because of our dual class structure, members of the Scott family will continue to be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval even if they come to own less than 50% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock. The Scott family members have entered into a stockholder agreement giving family members a right of first refusal to purchase shares of Class B common stock that are intended to be sold or transferred, subject to certain exceptions, by other family members. This agreement may have the effect of continuing ownership of the Class B common stock and control within the Scott family. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate matters. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\n\u201cAnti-takeover\u201d provisions and the regulations to which we are subject also may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders.\nWe are a financial and bank holding company incorporated in the State of Montana. Anti-takeover provisions in Montana law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as regulatory approvals that would be required under federal law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our Class A common stock. These provisions could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and could reduce the amount that stockholders might receive if we are sold.\nOur articles of incorporation provide that our Board may issue up to 100,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, without stockholder approval and with such terms, conditions, rights, privileges and preferences as the Board may deem appropriate. In addition, our articles of incorporation provide for staggered terms for our Board and limitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders. In addition, certain provisions of Montana law may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our Class A common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of such Class A common stock.\nFurther, the acquisition of specified amounts of our common stock (in some cases, the acquisition or control of more than 5% of our voting stock) may require certain regulatory approvals, including the approval of the Federal Reserve and one or more of our state banking regulatory agencies. The filing of applications with these agencies and the accompanying review process can take several months. Additionally, as discussed above, the holders of the Class B common stock will have voting control of our company. This and the other factors described above may hinder or even prevent a change in control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nFuture equity issuances could result in dilution, which could cause our Class A common stock price to decline.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional Class A common stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, Class A common stock. We may issue additional Class A common stock in the future pursuant to current or future employee stock option plans or in connection with future acquisitions or financings. Should we choose to raise capital by selling shares of Class A common stock for any reason, the issuance would have a dilutive effect on the holders of our Class A common stock and could have a material negative effect on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules and may rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nAs a result of the combined voting power of the members of the Scott family described above, we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. As a controlled company, we may rely on exemptions from certain NASDAQ corporate governance standards that are available to controlled companies, including the requirements that:\n\u2022\na majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022\nthe compensation of officers be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors; and\n\u2022\ndirector nominees be selected, or recommended for the board of directors' selection, by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee comprised solely of independent directors with a written charter or board resolution addressing the nomination process.\nAs a result, in the future, our compensation and governance & nominating committees may not consist entirely of independent directors. As long as we choose to rely on these exemptions from NASDAQ Marketplace Rules in the future, you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NASDAQ corporate governance requirements.\nThe Class A common stock is equity and is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness.\nShares of our Class A common stock are equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, shares of our Class A common stock rank junior to all our indebtedness, including our subordinated term loans, the subordinated debentures held by trusts that have issued trust preferred securities and other non-equity claims on us with respect to assets available to satisfy claims on us. Additionally, holders of our Class A common stock are subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of any holders of Series A preferred stock then outstanding.\nIn the future, we may make additional offerings of debt or equity securities, including medium-term notes, trust preferred securities, senior or subordinated notes and preferred stock. Or, we may issue additional debt or equity securities as consideration for future mergers and acquisitions. Such additional debt and equity offerings may place restrictions on our ability to pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock, dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our Class A common stock. Furthermore, acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Holders of our Class A common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution.", "PERMNO": 93304, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FIBK"}
