Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all other information set forth in this report. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. They are not, however, the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe not to be material may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. This report also includes forward-looking statements that involve risks or uncertainties. Our results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks we face described below and elsewhere. See \u201cForward Looking Statements\u201d.\nComplying with numerous regulations pertaining to our business is an expensive and time-consuming process, and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties.\nThe clinical laboratory testing industry is highly regulated and there can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which we operate will not change significantly and adversely in the future. Areas of the regulatory environment that may affect our ability to conduct business include, without limitation:\nfederal and state laws applicable to billing and claims payment;\nfederal and state laboratory anti-mark-up laws;\nfederal and state anti-kickback laws;\nfederal and state false claims laws;\nfederal self-referral and financial inducement prohibition laws, commonly known as the Stark Law, and the state equivalents;\nfederal and state laws governing laboratory licensing and testing, including CLIA;\nfederal and state laws governing the development, use and distribution of diagnostic medical tests known as laboratory developed tests or \u201cLDTs\u201d;\nHIPAA, along with the revisions to HIPPA as a result of the HITECH Act, and analogous state laws;\nfederal, state and foreign regulation of privacy, security, electronic transactions and identity theft;\nfederal, state and local laws governing the handling, transportation and disposal of medical and hazardous waste;\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration rules and regulations;\nchanges to laws, regulations and rules as a result of the Health Care Reform Law; and\nchanges to other federal, state and local laws, regulations and rules, including tax laws.\nWe have adopted policies and procedures designed to comply with these laws. In the ordinary course of business, we conduct internal reviews of our compliance with these laws. The growth of our business and sales organization may increase the potential for violating these laws or our internal policies and procedures, despite our ongoing vigilance in maintaining and updating our compliance procedures. The risk of our being found in violation of these or other laws and regulations is further increased by the fact that many of them are extremely complex and in many instances, there are no significant regulatory or judicial interpretations of these laws and regulations. Any action brought against us for violation of these or other laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Any determination that we have violated these laws or regulations, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these laws or regulations, could harm our operating results and financial condition. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to any applicable penalty associated with the violation, including civil and criminal penalties, damages and fines, we could be required to refund payments received by us, and we could be required to curtail or cease our operations. In addition, a significant change in any of these laws or regulations may require us to change our business model in order to maintain compliance with these laws or regulations, which could harm our operating results and financial condition.\nOur business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or changing interpretations of, CLIA or state laboratory licensing laws to which we are subject.\nThe clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, are federal regulatory standards that apply to virtually all clinical laboratories (regardless of the location, size or type of laboratory), including those operated by physicians in their offices, by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally approved accreditation agency. CLIA does not preempt state law, which in some cases may be more stringent than federal law and require additional personnel qualifications, quality control, record maintenance and proficiency testing. The sanction for failure to comply with CLIA and state requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory\u2019s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. Several states have similar laws and we may be subject to similar penalties.\nWe cannot assure you that applicable statutes and regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect our business. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on us, which may be costly.\nFailure to comply with HIPAA, including regarding the use of new \u201cstandard transactions,\u201d may negatively impact our profitability and cash flows.\nPursuant to HIPAA, we must comply with comprehensive privacy and security standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information, as well as standards for electronic transactions, including specified transaction and code set rules. Under recent HITECH amendments to HIPAA, the law was expanded, including requirements to provide notification of certain identified data breaches, direct patient access to laboratory records, the extension of certain HIPAA privacy and security standards directly to business associates, and heightened penalties for noncompliance, and enforcement efforts.\nIn addition, the HIPAA transaction standards are complex, and subject to differences in interpretation by payors. For instance, some payors may interpret the standards to require us to provide certain types of information, including demographic information not usually provided to us by physicians. As a result of inconsistent application of transaction standards by payors or the our inability to obtain certain billing information not usually provided to us by physicians, we could face increased costs and complexity, a temporary disruption in receipts and ongoing reductions in the timeliness of reimbursement. In addition, new requirements for additional standard transactions, such as claims attachments, Version 5010 of the HIPAA Transaction Standards and the ICD-10-CM Code Set, could prove technically difficult, time-consuming or expensive to implement. We are working closely with our payors to establish acceptable protocols for claim submission and with our trade association and an industry coalition to present issues and problems as they arise to the appropriate regulators and standards setting organizations.\nFDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests (\u201cLDTs\u201d) may result in significant change, and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt.\nHigh complexity, CLIA-certified laboratories, such as ours, frequently develop testing procedures internally to provide diagnostic results to customers, which are offered as laboratory-developed tests. The FDA claims to have regulatory authority over these LDTs and has stated that it intends to issue guidance to the industry regarding its regulatory approach. In such discussions, the FDA has indicated that it would use a risk-based approach to regulation and would direct more resources to tests with wider distribution and with the highest risk of injury, but that it will be sensitive to the need to not adversely impact patient care or innovation. . In September 2014, the FDA announced its framework and timetable for implementing this guidance. Through the American Clinical Laboratory Association (\u201cACLA\u201d) the industry has announced its intention to oppose the guidance proposed by the FDA and has engaged the services of Professor Lawrence Tribe and former Solicitor General Paul Clemente to represent the interests of the industry in this matter. We cannot predict the ultimate timing or form of any such guidance or regulation and the potential impact on our existing tests, our tests in development [or the materials used to perform our tests].If adopted, such a regulatory approach by the FDA may lead to an increased regulatory burden, including additional costs and delays in introducing new tests. While the ultimate impact of the FDA\u2019s approach is unknown, it may be extensive and may result in significant change. Our failure to adapt to these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA failure to comply with any of federal or state laws applicable to our business, particularly laws related to the elimination of healthcare fraud, may adversely impact our business.\nFederal officials responsible for administering and enforcing the healthcare laws and regulations have made a priority of eliminating healthcare fraud. For example, the Health Care Reform Law includes significant new fraud and abuse measures, including required disclosures of financial arrangements with physician customers, lower thresholds for violations and increasing potential penalties for such violations. Federal funding available for combating health care fraud and abuse generally has increased. While we seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, many of the laws and regulations applicable to our business, particularly those relating to billing and reimbursement of tests and those relating to relationships with physicians, hospitals and patients, contain language that has not been interpreted\nby courts. We must rely on our interpretation of these laws and regulations based on the advice of our counsel and regulatory or law enforcement authorities may not agree with our interpretation of these laws and regulations and may seek to enforce legal remedies or penalties against us for violations. From time to time we may need to change our operations, particularly pricing or billing practices, in response to changing interpretations of these laws and regulations or regulatory or judicial determinations with respect to these laws and regulations. These occurrences, regardless of their outcome, could damage our reputation and harm important business relationships that we have with healthcare providers, payors and others. Furthermore, if a regulatory or judicial authority finds that we have not complied with applicable laws and regulations, we could be required to refund amounts that were billed and collected in violation of such laws and regulations. In addition, we may voluntarily refund amounts that were alleged to have been billed and collected in violation of applicable laws and regulations. In either case, we could suffer civil and criminal damages, fines and penalties, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could harm our operating results and financial condition. Moreover, regardless of the outcome, if we or physicians or other third parties with whom we do business are investigated by a regulatory or law enforcement authority we could incur substantial costs, including legal fees, and our management may be required to divert a substantial amount of time to an investigation.\nTo enhance compliance with applicable health care laws, and mitigate potential liability in the event of noncompliance, regulatory authorities, such as the United States Health and Human Services Department Office of Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d), have recommended the adoption and implementation of a comprehensive health care compliance program that generally contains the elements of an effective compliance and ethics program described in Section 8B2.1 of the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual, and for many years the OIG has made available a model compliance program targeted to the clinical laboratory industry. In addition, certain states, such as New York, requires that health care providers, such as clinical laboratories, that engage in substantial business under the state Medicaid program have a compliance program that generally adheres to the standards set forth in the Model Compliance Program. Also, under the Health Care Reform Law, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, will require suppliers, such as the Company, to adopt, as a condition of Medicare participation, compliance programs that meet a core set of requirements. While we have adopted U.S. healthcare compliance and ethics programs that generally incorporate the OIG\u2019s recommendations, and train our employees in such compliance, having such a program can be no assurance that we will avoid any compliance issues.\nFailure to maintain the security of patient-related information or compliance with security requirements could damage our reputation with customers, cause us to incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation.\nPursuant to HIPAA, and certain similar state laws, we must comply with comprehensive privacy and security standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information. Under the HITECH amendments to HIPAA, HIPAA was expanded to require certain data breach notification, to extend certain HIPAA privacy and security standards directly to business associates, to heighten penalties for noncompliance, and enhance enforcement efforts.\nIn March 2014 CareEvolve, the Company\u2019s wholly owned connectivity subsidiary, became aware that there had been a HIPAA breach with regard to one of its servers managed at an internet service provider site called XAND. CareEvolve immediately identified and resolved the breach issue, but in the meantime an Internet data googlebot, a data collection \u201crobot\u201d operated by Google, Inc. had briefly acquired data from a server and made it available to Internet searches. To the best of the Company\u2019s knowledge, there were no known disclosures of this Patient Health Information (\u201cPHI\u201d) to unauthorized parties and the Company took immediate steps to have the PHI removed from the Internet. The Company self-reported this incident to the appropriate government agency, the Office of Civil Rights (\u201cOCR\u201d) and is awaiting further discussions, investigation and action by OCR.\nWe receive certain personal and financial information about our clients and their patients. In addition, we depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. A compromise in our security systems that results in client or patient personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons or our failure to comply with security requirements for financial transactions could adversely affect our reputation with our clients and result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties, all of which may adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nFailure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration Act, the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act and the Comprehensive Medical Waste Management Act, could result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure, and have a material adverse effect upon our business.\nWe are subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials, as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers, including clinical laboratories, whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus. These requirements, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens. In addition, the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act requires, among other things, that we include in our safety programs the evaluation and use of engineering controls such as safety needles if found to be effective at reducing the risk of needlestick injuries in the workplace.\nWaste management is subject to federal and state regulations governing the transportation and disposal of medical waste including bodily fluids. Federal regulations require licensure of interstate transporters of medical waste. In New Jersey, we are subject to the Comprehensive Medical Waste Management Act (\u201cCMWMA\u201d), which requires us to register as a generator of special medical waste. All of our medical waste is disposed of by a licensed interstate hauler. The hauler provides a manifest of the disposition of the waste products as well as a certificate of incineration, which is retained by us. These records are audited by the State of New Jersey on a yearly basis. We are also subject to the Federal Hazardous materials transportation law, 49 U.S.C. 5101 et seq., and the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR), 49 CFR parts 171-180. The federal government has classified hazardous medical waste as hazardous materials for the purpose of regulation. These regulations preempt state regulation, which must be \u201csubstantively the same,\u201d \u201cthe non-federal requirement must conform \u201cin every significant respect to the federal requirement. Editorial and other similar de minimis changes are permitted,\u201d 49 CFR 107.202(d).\nFailure to comply with such federal, state and local laws and regulations could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements us, which may be costly.\nFailure to comply with complex federal and state laws and regulations related to submission of claims for clinical laboratory services could result in significant monetary damages and penalties and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations relating to the submission of claims for payment for clinical laboratory services, including those that relate to coverage of our services under Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental health care programs, the amounts that may be billed for our services and to whom claims for services may be submitted. These rules may also affect the Company in light of the practice management products that we market, to the extent that these products are considered to affect the manner in which our customers\u2019 submit their own claims for services. Submission of our claims is particularly complex because we provide both anatomic pathology services and clinical laboratory tests, which generally are paid using different reimbursement principles. The clinical laboratory tests are often paid under a clinical laboratory fee schedule, and the anatomic pathology services are often paid under a physician fee schedule.\nOur failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in our inability to receive payment for our services or result in attempts by third-party payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid, to recover payments from us that have already been made. Submission of claims in violation of certain statutory or regulatory requirements can result in penalties, including substantial civil money penalties for each item or service billed to Medicare in violation of the legal requirement, and exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid. Government authorities may also assert that violations of laws and regulations related to submission or causing the submission of claims violate the federal False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d) or other laws related to fraud and abuse, including submission of claims for services that were not medically necessary. Violations of the FCA could result in enormous economic liability. The FCA provides that all damages are trebled, and each false claim submitted is subject to a penalty of up to $11,000. For example, we could be subject to FCA liability if it was determined that the services we provided were not medically necessary and not reimbursable, particularly if it were asserted that we contributed to the physician\u2019s referrals of unnecessary services to us. It is also possible that the government could attempt to hold us liable under fraud and abuse laws for improper claims submitted by an entity for services that we performed if we were found to have knowingly participated in the arrangement that resulted in submission of the improper claims.\nChanges in regulation and policies, including increasing downward pressure on health care reimbursement, may adversely affect reimbursement for diagnostic services and could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nReimbursement levels for health care services are subject to continuous and often unexpected changes in policies, and we face a variety of efforts by government payors to reduce utilization and reimbursement for diagnostic testing services. Changes in governmental reimbursement may result from statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments, administrative rulings, competitive bidding initiatives, and other policy changes.\nThe U.S. Congress has considered, at least yearly in conjunction with budgetary legislation, changes to one or both of the Medicare fee schedules under which we receive reimbursement, which include the physician fee schedule for anatomical pathology services, and the clinical laboratory fee schedule for our clinical laboratory services. For example, currently there is no copayment or coinsurance required for clinical laboratory services, although there is for our physician services. However, Congress has periodically considered imposing a 20 percent coinsurance on laboratory services. If enacted, this would require us to attempt to collect this amount from patients, although in many cases the costs of collection would exceed the amount actually received.\nOur reimbursement for our pathology services is paid primarily under the physician fee schedule of Medicare and Medicaid and is therefore governed by a complex formula, referred to as the Sustainable Growth Rate, or SGR. As the use of this formula could result in a significant reduction in reimbursement for all physician services, Congress usually acts each year to prevent the full amount of such reductions from taking effect. In 2011, Congress acted to prevent reductions in for 2012, and 2013. In March 2014, Congress enacted the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (\u201cPAMA\u201d). Pursuant to this legislation, CLFS fees will be stable until 2017, during which time Congress has mandated CMS to perform a market study to make sure that CMS is being fees commensurate with those being paid by commercial payors. There is no certainty regarding the effects of PAMA or even whether PAMA will survive through completion. At this point in time, however, the CLFS should be relatively stable through the year 2016. The SGR has currently been postponed until March 2015 and Congress continues to work on both a short term and a long term fix to this annual problem. If Congress fails to take such action in the future, implementation of this formula could adversely affect our business.\nThe Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) pays laboratories on the basis of a fee schedule that is reviewed and re-calculated on an annual basis. CMS may change the fee schedule upward or downward on billing codes that we submit for reimbursement on a regular basis. Our revenue and business may be adversely affected if the reimbursement rates associated with such codes are reduced. Even when reimbursement rates are not reduced, policy changes add to our costs by increasing the complexity and volume of administrative requirements. Medicaid reimbursement, which varies by state, is also subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures. Recently, state budget pressures have caused states to consider several policy changes that may impact our financial condition and results of operations, such as delaying payments, reducing reimbursement, restricting coverage eligibility and service coverage, and imposing taxes on our services.\nHealthcare policy changes, including recently enacted legislation reforming the U.S. healthcare system, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Health Care Reform Law makes changes that are expected to significantly impact clinical laboratories, among others. Beginning in 2013, each medical device manufacturer is paying a sales tax in an amount equal to 2.3% of the price for which such manufacturer sells its medical devices that are listed with the FDA. Although the FDA has contended that LDTs are medical devices, none of our products are currently listed with the FDA. We cannot assure you that the tax will not be extended to services such as ours in the future. The Health Care Reform Law also mandates a reduction in payments for clinical laboratory services paid under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, of 1.75% through 2015 and a productivity adjustment to the CLFS.\nOther significant measures contained in the Health Care Reform Law include, for example, coordination and promotion of research on comparative clinical effectiveness of different technologies and procedures, initiatives to revise Medicare payment methodologies, such as bundling of payments across the continuum of care by providers and physicians, and initiatives to promote quality indicators in payment methodologies. The Health Care Reform Law also includes significant new fraud and abuse measures, including required disclosures of financial arrangements with physician customers, lower thresholds for violations and increasing potential penalties for such violations. In addition, the Health Care Reform Law establishes an Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, to reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending. The IPAB has broad discretion to propose policies to reduce expenditures, which may have a negative impact on payment rates for services. The IPAB proposals may impact payments for clinical laboratory services beginning in 2016. We are monitoring the impact of the Health Care Reform Law in order to enable us to determine the trends and changes that may be necessitated by the legislation that may\npotentially impact on our business over time.\nIn addition to the Health Care Reform Law, various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged from federal and state governments. For example, in February 2012, Congress passed the \u201cMiddle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012\u201d which in part reduced the potential future cost-based increases to the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule by 2%. Overall the expected total fee cut to the CLFS for 2013 was 2.95% not including a further reduction of 2% from implementation of the automatic expense reductions (sequester) under the Budget Control Act of 2011 which went into effect for dates of service on or after April 1, 2013. Reductions made by the Congressional sequester are applied to total claims payments made. While these reductions did not result in a rebasing of the negotiated or established Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement rates, rebasing could occur as a result of future legislation. In 2015, the total fee cut to the CLFS will be 0.25% .\nWe cannot be certain that these or future changes will not affect payment rates in the future. We also cannot predict whether future healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us. The taxes imposed by the new federal legislation, cost reduction measures and the expansion in government\u2019s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may result in decreased profits to us, lower reimbursements by payors for our products or reduced medical procedure volumes, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChange in the billing and/or reimbursement procedures by the federal government could affect our ability to be paid as we have in the past for services rendered.\nCMS has changed or discussed making changes to certain types of reimbursement which could affect our rate of reimbursement. Certain cases are comprised of both a technical component (TC) and a professional component (PC). In certain specified areas of testing, primarily in the area of anatomic pathology, CMS has determined that some providers have over-utilized these testing procedures and CMS has introduced changes in reimbursement policies to discourage over-utilization. While the Company does not currently over-utilize services for self-gain and does not perform any significant amounts revenue for the areas of testing currently being changed by CMS, we are always subject to review by CMS and cannot be certain that CMS won\u2019t interpret our practices differently than we do. In addition, CMS may extend this logic and approach to other areas of testing that might affect work performed by us.\nCMS has announced planned changes in the area of Molecular Diagnostics\u2019 reimbursement, primarily designed to improve transparency in billing. Molecular Diagnostics is a rapidly changing and evolving area of clinical testing. Whereas other areas of clinical testing are well vetted and established with specific codes for reimbursement, Molecular Diagnostics has moved at a faster pace than CMS can proceed. Clinical laboratories accordingly use a process called cross-walking to get reimbursed by CMS. Cross-walking requires that the clinical laboratory identify the individual processes used to process the patient\u2019s specimen and identify diagnostic results that are already reimbursed in established tests. CMS seeks to specifically identify the testing routine being done and reimburse providers universally for the test actually being performed. CMS has not established all of the molecular diagnostic tests that will be included in this revised schedule for reimbursement and it has not determined how much will be reimbursed to providers for these tests. We expect CMS to implement fair and reasonable reimbursement for such tests, but until such pricing decisions are disclosed we cannot be certain what CMS will finally implement.\nEffective July 1, 2012, CMS eliminated an exemption that had been in place since 1999, which allowed commercial laboratories to bill for certain diagnostic tests performed on in-patient and certain outreach recipients by commercial laboratories. From 1999 through July 1, 2012, commercial laboratories were allowed to bill CMS for such tests despite the fact that the recipient was a hospital patient as long as the hospital had been submitting such tests for diagnosis to commercial laboratories prior to 1999. Upon termination of the exemption, we were required to find out from the hospital submitting the test whether the recipient\u2019s bill for diagnostic testing will be reimbursed by the hospital or should be billed to CMS. We have systems in place to manage this change, but these systems are dependent upon our getting proper information from the hospital clients.\nThe Federal Government is faced with significant economic decisions in the coming years. Some solutions being offered in the government could substantially change the way laboratory testing is reimbursed by government entities. We cannot be certain what or how any such government changes may affect our business.\u201d\nHealthcare plans have taken steps to control the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services, including clinical test services.\nWe also face efforts by non-governmental third-party payors, including healthcare plans, to reduce utilization and reimbursement for clinical testing services.\nThe healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among healthcare insurance plans, resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers, including clinical testing providers. These healthcare plans, and independent physician associations, may demand that clinical testing providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capped payment arrangements. In addition, some healthcare plans have been willing to limit the PPO or POS laboratory network to only a single national laboratory to obtain improved fee-for-service pricing. There are also an increasing number of patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient cost-sharing.\nThe increased consolidation among healthcare plans also has increased the potential adverse impact of ceasing to be a contracted provider with any such insurer. The Health Care Reform Law includes provisions, such as the creation of healthcare exchanges, which may encourage healthcare insurance plans to increase exclusive contracting.\nWe expect continuing efforts to reduce reimbursements, to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services. These efforts, including future changes in third-party payor rules, practices and policies, or ceasing to be a contracted provider to a healthcare plan, may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIncreased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on our net revenues and profitability.\nOur industry is characterized by intense competition. Our major competitors in the New York metropolitan super-region, Quest Diagnostics and Laboratory Corporation of America, are large national laboratories that possess greater name recognition, larger customer bases, significantly greater financial resources and employ substantially more personnel than we do. Many of our competitors have long established\nrelationships with their customers and third-party payors. Despite a long established history of successfully competing in these markets, we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with such entities in the future.\nThe clinical laboratory business is intensely competitive both in terms of price and service. Pricing of laboratory testing services is often one of the most significant factors used by health care providers and third-party payors in selecting a laboratory. As a result of the clinical laboratory industry undergoing significant consolidation, larger clinical laboratory providers are able to increase cost efficiencies afforded by large-scale automated testing. This consolidation results in greater price competition. We may be unable to increase cost efficiencies sufficiently, if at all, and as a result, our net earnings and cash flows could be negatively impacted by such price competition. Additionally, we may also face changes in fee schedules, competitive bidding for laboratory services or other actions or pressures reducing payment schedules as a result of increased or additional competition.\nAdditional competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on our net revenues and profitability.\nA failure to obtain and retain new clients and business partners, a loss of existing clients or material contracts, or a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing clients, could impact our ability to successfully grow our business.\nTo offset efforts by payors to reduce the cost and utilization of clinical laboratory services, we need to obtain and retain new clients and business partners. In addition, a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing clients, without offsetting growth in our client base, could impact our ability to successfully grow our business and could have a material adverse impact on our net revenues and profitability. We compete primarily on the basis of the quality of testing, reporting and information systems, reputation in the medical community, the pricing of services and ability to employ qualified personnel. Our failure to successfully compete on any of these factors could result in the loss of clients and a reduction in our ability to expand our customer base.\nFailure to timely or accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business\nBilling for clinical testing services is extremely complicated and is subject to extensive and non-uniform rules and administrative requirements. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we bill various payors, such as patients, insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid, physicians, hospitals and employer groups. Changes in laws and regulations could increase the complexity and cost of our billing process. Additionally, auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further cost and complexity to the billing process. Further, our billing systems require significant technology investment and, as a result of marketplace demands, we need to continually invest in our billing systems.\nMissing or incorrect information on requisitions adds complexity to and slows the billing process, creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions, and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense. We believe that much of our bad debt expense in recent years is attributable to the lack of, or inaccurate, billing information. Failure to timely or correctly bill may lead to our not being reimbursed for our services or an increase in the aging of our accounts receivable, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with applicable laws relating to billing government healthcare programs could lead to various penalties, including: (1) exclusion from participation in CMS and other government programs; (2) asset forfeitures; (3) civil and criminal fines and penalties; and (4) the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows.\nThere have been times when our accounts receivable have increased at a greater rate than revenue growth and, therefore, have adversely affected our cash flows from operations. We have taken steps to implement systems and processing changes intended to improve billing procedures and related collection results. We believe that we have made progress by reorganizing our accounts receivable and billing functions and that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate. However, we cannot assure that our ongoing assessment of accounts receivable will not result in the need for additional provisions. Such additional provisions, if implemented, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur failure or the failure of third-party payors or physicians to comply with ICD-10-CM Code Set, and our failure to comply with other emerging electronic transaction standards could adversely impact our business.\nWe are within the assessment and inventory phase to adopt the ICD-10-CM Code Set issued by HHS on January 16, 2009. Compliance with the ICD-10-CM Code Set is currently required to be in place by October 1, 2015. The Company will continue its assessment of information systems, applications and processes for compliance with these requirements. Clinical laboratories are typically required to submit health care claims with diagnosis codes to third party payors. The diagnosis codes must be obtained from the ordering physician. Our failure or the failure of third party payors or physicians to transition within the required timeframe could have an adverse impact on reimbursement, days sales outstanding and cash collections.\nAlso, the failure of our IT systems to keep pace with technological advances may significantly reduce our revenues or increase our expenses. Public and private initiatives to create healthcare information technology (\u201cHCIT\u201d) standards and to mandate standardized clinical coding systems for the electronic exchange of clinical information, including test orders and test results, could require costly modifications to our existing HCIT systems. While we do not expect HCIT standards to be adopted or implemented without adequate time to comply, if we fail to adopt or delay in implementing HCIT standards, we could lose customers and business opportunities.\nFailure in our information technology systems could significantly increase testing turn-around time or billing processes and otherwise disrupt our operations.\nOur laboratory operations depend, in part, on the continued performance of our information technology systems. Our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptions. In addition, we are in the process of integrating the information technology systems of our recently acquired subsidiaries, and we may experience system failures or interruptions as a result of this process. Sustained system failures or interruption of our systems in one or more of our laboratory operations could disrupt our ability to process laboratory requisitions, perform testing, provide test results in a timely manner and/or bill the appropriate party. Breaches with respect to protected health information could result in violations of HIPAA and analogous state laws, and risk the imposition of significant fines and penalties. Failure of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business, profitability and financial condition.\nAdverse results in material litigation matters could have a material adverse effect upon our business.\nWe may become subject in the ordinary course of business to material legal action related to, among other things, professional liability and employee-related matters, as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and Medicare or Medicaid carriers requesting comment on allegations of billing irregularities that are brought to their attention through billing audits or third parties. Legal actions could result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to our reputation with clients, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business.\nIn December 2013, the Company instituted an action against Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield (New Jersey) (\u201cHBCBS\u201d) in which the Company identified a significant portion of business that the Company has billed to HBCBS has refused to pay the Company even though the Company believes it is entitled to payment. In the Spring 2014, HBCBS was denied a Motion for Summary Judgment it had made to dismiss the case and the case is currently in the discovery phase and is unlikely to be concluded any time soon. The Company continues to operate as an in-network provider in the HBCBS Preferred Provider network (\u201cPPO network\u201d) and has seen no disruption of service with HBCBS to date.\nIn October 2013, Myriad Genetics, Inc., sued GeneDx alleging that GeneDx has infringed certain patent rights of Myriad with regard to its inherited cancers testing program. There are six other companies being sued on the same basis, including Quest Diagnostics and Laboratory Corporation of America. The seven defendants began offering tests for the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 after a decision in June 2013 by the United States Supreme Court, in which the Court invalidated a portion of the claims included in the asserted patents. Myriad sought a Preliminary Injunction against one of the other defendants in the case and that Preliminary Injunction application was denied by the trial judge, and recently by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (\u201cFederal Circuit\u201d), which held invalid several additional claims of the asserted patents. GeneDx has in turn filed a series of Inter Partes Review petitions in the United States Patent and Trade Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) to invalidate several claims in 13 of the patents that Myriad alleges GeneDx has infringed.\nThese actions have been outside the course of ordinary legal business of the Company and have significantly increased legal fees for the Company during the pendency of these cases.\nWe may be unable to obtain, maintain or enforce our intellectual property rights and may be subject to intellectual property litigation that could adversely impact our business.\nWe may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate patent or other proprietary rights for our products and services or to successfully enforce our proprietary rights. In addition, we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others, which could force us to do one or more of the following:\ncease developing, performing or selling products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\nobtain and pay for licenses from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right;\nredesign or reengineer our tests;\nchange our business processes; or\npay substantial damages, court costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, including potentially increased damages for any infringement held to be willful.\nThe Company believes that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material to its business as a whole.\nIf patent regulations or standards are modified, such changes could have a negative impact on our business.\nAt present, other than patent rights obtained by license from third parties, the Company does not have title to any patent rights of its own. Should that change, there are a number of uncertainties to the procurement and maintenance of patent rights. For example, from time to time, the U.S. Supreme Court, other federal courts, the U.S. Congress, or the USPTO may change the standards of patentability and validity and any such changes could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, competitors may develop their own versions of our test(s) in countries where we did not apply for patents, including encouraging the use of their test(s) by physicians or patients in such countries.\nThere have been several cases involving \u201cgene patents\u201d and diagnostic claims that have been considered by the U.S. Supreme Court. On March 20, 2012, the Supreme Court issued a decision in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., a case involving patent claims directed to optimizing the amount of drug administered to a patient. According to that decision, Prometheus\u2019 claims failed to add enough inventive content to the underlying natural laws to allow the processes they describe to qualify as patent-eligible processes. In Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., the Court issued a decision on June 13, 2013, ruling that claims to \u201cisolated\u201d naturally-occurring DNA molecules, and the information they encode, are not patent eligible. The Court indicated, however, that DNA not a \u201cproduct of nature,\u201d e.g., a complementary DNA or cDNA not found in nature, may be patent eligible. This decision invalidated certain claims of Myriad\u2019s U.S. patents related to the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. And, recently the Supreme Court confirmed in a 2014 software case (Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank International) that the framework for analyzing the eligibility of patent claims, including those that encompass genes and genetic diagnostics, follows a two-step process that proceeds through a determination of whether a claim is directed to a law of nature, a natural phenomenon, or an abstract idea.\nWe cannot assure you that any patents that we might obtain in the future on our products and services or any licenses that we might obtain to the patent rights of third parties will not be negatively impacted by these decisions, rulings in other cases, or changes in guidance or procedures issued by the USPTO.\nWe may enter into license agreements with third parties to obtain patent rights that we deem to be necessary to the performance of our business, only to find that because of subsequent changes in the patent law or regulations, such licenses are later no longer necessary. We may then have to withdraw from or terminate any such licenses. Since termination of a license is a contractual matter, there are risks involved-including litigation risks-in such terminations.\nWe are facing, and may in the future face, intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming and costly to defend, and could result in our loss of significant rights and the assessment of treble damages.\nAs described above, Myriad Genetics has sued GeneDx alleging infringement of certain asserted patents by offering, among other things, OncoGeneDx, our comprehensive series of inherited cancers testing, including testing for the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 and colon cancer susceptibility gene MUTYH. We may from time to time receive additional notices of claims of infringement and misappropriation or misuse of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights, such as the one we received from Myriad Genetics. Some of these additional\nclaims may also lead to litigation. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in such actions, or that other actions alleging misappropriation or misuse by us of third-party trade secrets, infringement by us of third-party patents and trademarks, will not be asserted or prosecuted against us.\nWe may also initiate claims to defend our intellectual property or to seek relief on allegations that we use, sell, or offer to sell technology that incorporates third party intellectual property. Intellectual property litigation, regardless of outcome, is expensive and time-consuming, could divert management\u2019s attention from our business and have a material negative effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. If there is a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to do one or more of the following:\nCease developing, performing or selling products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; obtain and pay for licenses from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right that may not be available on acceptable or commercially practical terms, if at all; redesign or reengineer our tests to develop non-infringing technology; change our business processes; or pay substantial damages, court costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, including potentially treble damages for any infringement held to be willful.\nOur failure to develop non-infringing technologies or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis could harm our business.\nThe Company believes that no single technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or patent license held by the Company is material to its business as a whole.\nFailure to establish, and perform to, appropriate quality standards to assure that the highest level of quality is observed in the performance of our testing services and in the design, manufacture and marketing of our products could adversely affect the results of our operations and adversely impact our reputation.\nThe provision of clinical testing services, including anatomic pathology services, and related services, and the design, manufacture and marketing of diagnostic products involve certain inherent risks. The services that we provide and the products that we design, manufacture and market are intended to provide information for healthcare providers in providing patient care. Therefore, users of our services and products may have a greater sensitivity to errors than the users of services or products that are intended for other purposes.\nManufacturing or design defects, unanticipated use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of the products can lead to injury or other adverse events. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products (either voluntary or required by governmental authorities) and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of a product from the market. Any recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity that could reduce demand for our products. Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals.\nSimilarly, negligence in performing our services can lead to injury or other adverse events. We may be sued under physician liability or other liability law for acts or omissions by our pathologists, laboratory personnel and hospital employees who are under the supervision of our hospital-based pathologists. We are subject to the attendant risk of substantial damages awards and risk to our reputation.\nDiscontinuation or recalls of existing testing products, failure to develop, or acquire, licenses for new or improved testing technologies; or our clients using new technologies to perform their own tests could adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time, manufacturers discontinue or recall reagents, test kits or instruments used by us to perform laboratory testing. Such discontinuations or recalls could adversely affect our costs, testing volume and revenue.\nThe clinical laboratory industry is subject to changing technology and new product introductions. Our success in maintaining a leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies will depend, in part, on our ability to develop, acquire or license new and improved technologies on favorable terms and to obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement for these technologies. We may not be able to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and it cannot be certain that such arrangements will yield commercially successful diagnostic tests. If we are unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates, our research and development costs may increase as a result. In addition, if we are unable to license new or improved technologies to expand our esoteric testing operations, our testing methods may become outdated when compared with our competition and testing volume and revenue may be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, advances in technology may lead to the development of more cost-effective technologies such as point-of-care testing equipment that can be operated by physicians or other healthcare providers in their offices or by patients themselves without requiring the services of freestanding clinical laboratories. Development of such technology and its use by our clients could reduce the demand for our laboratory testing services and negatively impact our revenues.\nCurrently, most clinical laboratory testing is categorized as \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cmoderate\u201d complexity, and thereby is subject to extensive and costly regulation under CLIA. The cost of compliance with CLIA makes it impractical for most physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices, and other laws limit the ability of physicians to have ownership in a laboratory and to refer tests to such a laboratory. Manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing point-of-care laboratory equipment to physicians and by selling test kits approved for home or physician office use to both physicians and patients. Diagnostic tests approved for home use are automatically deemed to be \u201cwaived\u201d tests under CLIA and may be performed in physician office laboratories as well as by patients in their homes with minimal regulatory oversight. Other tests meeting certain FDA criteria also may be classified as \u201cwaived\u201d for CLIA purposes. The FDA has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories and has taken responsibility from the Centers for Disease Control for classifying the complexity of tests for CLIA purposes. Increased approval of \u201cwaived\u201d test kits could lead to increased testing by physicians in their offices or by patients at home, which could affect our market for laboratory testing services and negatively impact our revenues.\nClinicians or patients using our services may sue us, and our insurance may not sufficiently cover all claims brought against us, which will increase our expenses.\nThe development, marketing, sale and performance of healthcare services expose us to the risk of litigation, including professional negligence. Damages assessed in connection with, and the costs of defending, any legal action could be substantial. We may be faced with litigation claims that exceed our insurance coverage or are not covered under any of our insurance policies. In addition, litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business if it impacts our existing and potential customer relationships, creates adverse public relations, diverts management resources from the operation of the business, or hampers our ability to otherwise conduct our business.\nA failure to integrate newly acquired businesses and the costs related to such integration could have a material adverse impact on our net revenues and profitability.\nThe successful integration of any business that we may acquire entails numerous risks, including, among others:\nissues related to revenue recognition and/or cash collections;\nloss of key customers or employees;\ndifficulty in consolidating redundant facilities and infrastructure and in standardizing information and other systems;\nfailure to maintain quality of services that we and any such acquired companies have historically provided;\ncoordination of geographically separated facilities and workforces; and\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from our day-to-day business.\nWe cannot assure you that current or future acquisitions, if any, or any related integration efforts will be successful, or that our business will not be adversely affected by any future acquisitions. Even if we are able to successfully integrate the operations of companies or businesses that we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to realize the benefits that we expect to result from such integration, including projected cost savings.\nOur operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of extreme weather conditions, natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, health pandemics, hostilities or acts of terrorism and other criminal activities.\nOur operations were adversely impacted by the effects of Hurricane Sandy, and may be adversely impacted by other extreme weather conditions, natural disasters, health pandemics, hostilities or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities from time to time. Such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek clinical testing services or in our employees\u2019 ability to perform their job duties. In addition, such events may temporarily interrupt our ability to transport specimens, to receive materials from our suppliers or otherwise to provide our services. The occurrence of any such event and/or a disruption to our operations as a result may adversely impact our results of operations.\nAn inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.\nThe loss of key management personnel or the inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified employees at our clinical laboratories and research centers could adversely affect our business. Our success is dependent in part on the efforts of key members of our management team, including Marc D. Grodman, M.D., our founder, president and chief executive officer. Success in maintaining our leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain skilled research professionals. In addition, the success of our clinical laboratories also depends on employing and retaining qualified and experienced laboratory professionals, including specialists, who perform clinical laboratory testing services. In the future, if competition for the services of these professionals increases, we may not be able to continue to attract and retain individuals in its markets. Our net revenues and earnings could be adversely affected if a significant number of professionals terminate their relationship with us or become unable or unwilling to continue their employment.\nOur outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibility.\nAs of October 31, 2014, we had approximately $37,049 of debt outstanding. Our debt agreements contain various restrictive covenants. These restrictions could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must use a portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our debt.\nWe or our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to make principal and interest payments will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. If we incur additional debt, a greater portion of our cash flows may be needed to satisfy our debt service obligations and if we do not generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service requirements, we may need to seek additional financing. In that case, it may be more difficult, or we may be unable, to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us. As a result, we would be more vulnerable to general adverse economic, industry and capital markets conditions as well as the other risks associated with the indebtedness.\nPossible volatility in our stock price could negatively affect us and our stockholders.\nThe trading price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market has fluctuated significantly in the past. During the period from November 1, 2011 through October 31, 2014, the trading price of our common stock fluctuated from a high of $37.73 per share to a low of $12.03 per share. In the past, we have experienced a drop in stock price following an announcement of disappointing earnings or earnings guidance. Any such announcement in the future could lead to a similar drop in stock price. The price of our common stock could also be subject to wide fluctuations in the future as a result of a number of other factors, including the following:\nchanges in expectations as to future financial performance or buy/sell recommendations of securities analysts;\nour, or a competitor\u2019s, announcement of new products or services, or significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies; and adverse publicity.\nIn addition, the U.S. securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of companies in these markets. Broad market and industry factors may lead to volatility in the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Moreover, our stock has limited trading volume, and this illiquidity may increase the volatility of our stock price.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of an individual company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation often has been instituted against that company. The institution of similar litigation against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nCertain provisions of our charter, by-laws and New Jersey law may delay or prevent a change of control of our company.\nOur certificate of incorporation, as amended, requires the approval of 80% of our outstanding shares for any merger or consolidation unless the business combination has been approved or authorized by our board of directors. As a New Jersey corporation with a class of securities registered with the SEC, we are governed by certain provisions of the New Jersey Business Corporation Act that also restrict business combinations with shareholders owning 10% or more of our outstanding shares (or other \u201cinterested stockholders\u201d as the term is defined by the New Jersey Shareholders\u2019 Protection Act) for a period of five years after such interested shareholder achieves such status unless the business combination is approved by our board of directors prior to the shareholder becoming an interested shareholder. The New Jersey Shareholders\u2019 Protection Act also restricts business combinations with an interested shareholder after the five-year period unless the transaction receives the approval of two-thirds of the shares outstanding, exclusive of the shares held by the interested shareholder or the transaction satisfies certain fair price requirements. In addition, with certain limited exceptions, federal regulations prohibit a person or company or a group of persons deemed to be \u201cacting in concert\u201d from, directly or indirectly, acquiring more than 10% (5% if the acquirer is a bank holding company) of any class of our voting stock or obtaining the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of our directors or otherwise direct the management or policies of our company without prior notice or application to and the approval of the Federal Reserve.\nA significant deterioration in the economy could negatively impact testing volumes, cash collections and the availability of credit.\nOur operations are dependent upon ongoing demand for diagnostic testing services by patients, physicians, hospitals and others. A significant downturn in the economy could negatively impact the demand for diagnostic testing as well as the ability of patients and other payors to pay for services ordered. In addition, uncertainty in the credit markets could reduce the availability of credit and impact our ability to meet our financing needs in the future.", "PERMNO": 10659, "SIC": 8071, "TIC": "BRLI.1"}
