{"cik": "821995", "company": "COLUMBIA LABORATORIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe may fail to obtain new contracts, renew existing contracts and/or have contract cancellations with customers of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Molecular Profiles, which may adversely affect our business.\nThe majority of our customer contracts in the services business are short-term in duration. As a result, we must maintain a robust backlog of programs with existing and new customers to replace contracts as they are completed. In the event we are unable to replace these contracts in a timely manner or at all, our revenues may not be able to be sustained or may decline. In addition, certain of our long-term contracts may be cancelled or delayed by clients for any reason upon notice. Multiple cancellations, non-renewals, or renewals on less favorable terms to us related to significant contracts could materially impact our business. While we intend to seek to negotiate new or extended agreements, if new contracts cannot be completed or existing contracts cannot be extended on terms acceptable to us or at all, our business, results of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is dependent on the continued sale of CRINONE to Merck Serono.\nOur operating results are dependent on the product revenues from Merck Serono derived from the sale of CRINONE in countries outside the U.S. Revenues from sales to Merck Serono during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 constituted approximately 53%, 73% and 67% of our total revenues, respectively. We do not control the amount and timing of marketing resources that Merck Serono may or may not devote to our product. The failure of Merck Serono to effectively market our products and maintain licensure in marketed countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our supply agreement with Merck Serono expires on May 19, 2020.\nWe have made significant capital investments in the Molecular Profiles services business to meet growth expectations. If we are unable to utilize the facilities\u2019 expected capacity, our margins could be adversely affected.\nWe have made substantial investments in our Nottingham, U.K. facilities and equipment to support increased development and contract manufacturing activity. If new customer agreements are not executed or do not generate expected revenues, we may have excess fixed costs capacity that may require an impairment charge that will negatively affect our financial performance.\nChanges in regulatory approval policy or statutory or regulatory requirements, or in the regulatory environment, during the development period of any of our product candidates may result in delays in the approval, or rejection, of the application for approval of one or more of our product candidates. If we fail to obtain approval, or are delayed in obtaining approval, of our product candidates, our ability to generate revenue will be severely impaired.\nThe process of drug development and regulatory approval for product candidates takes many years, during which time the FDA\u2019s interpretations of the standards against which drugs are judged for approval may evolve or change. The FDA can also change its approval policies based upon changes in laws and regulations. In addition, the FDA can, based on its then current approval policies, any changes in those policies and its broad discretion in the approval process, weigh the benefits and the risks of every drug candidate. As a result of any of the foregoing, the FDA may decide that the data we submit in support of an application for approval of a drug candidate are insufficient for approval.\nIf we, or our current or future collaborators, do not obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals for one or more of our product candidates, we will be unable to commercialize those product candidates. Further, if we are delayed in obtaining or unable to obtain, any required approvals, or our contract manufacturers are unable to manufacture and supply product for sale, our collaborators may terminate, or be entitled to terminate, their agreements with us or reduce or eliminate their payments to us under these agreements or we may be required to pay termination payments under these agreements.\nOur product candidates that are under development are subject to extensive domestic and foreign regulation. The FDA regulates, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record keeping, labeling, storage, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products in the U.S. In order to market our products abroad, we must comply with extensive regulation by foreign governments. If we are unable to obtain and maintain FDA and foreign government approvals for our product candidates, we, alone or through our collaborators, will not be permitted to sell them. Failure to obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing that product candidate.\nIn the U.S., an NDA or supplement must be filed with respect to each indication for which marketing approval of a product is sought. Each NDA, in turn, requires the successful completion of preclinical, toxicology, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies, as well as clinical trials demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the product for that particular indication. We may not receive regulatory approval of any of the NDAs that we file with the FDA or any approval of applications we may seek in the future outside the U.S.\nWe and our contract manufacturers are required to comply with the applicable FDA current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Further, manufacturing facilities must be approved by the FDA before they can be used to manufacture our product candidates, and are subject to additional FDA inspection. Manufacturing facilities may also be subject to state regulations.\nWe, or our third-party manufacturers, may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or other FDA regulatory requirements, or applicable state regulations, or may not be able to successfully manufacture our products that could result in a delay or an inability to commercialize the products. If we or our partners wish or need to identify an alternative manufacturer, delays in obtaining FDA approval of the alternative manufacturing facility could cause an interruption in the supply of our products.\nLabeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and state regulatory agencies and, in some cases, the Federal Trade Commission. FDA enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of unapproved products as well as the marketing of approved products for unapproved, or off-label, uses. These regulations and the FDA\u2019s interpretation of them may limit our or our partners\u2019 ability to market products for which we gain approval. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in federal and state regulatory enforcement action. Further, we may not obtain the labeling claims we or our partners believe are necessary or desirable for the promotion of our product candidates.\nThe price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market prices and volume of securities of small specialty pharmaceutical companies, including ours, from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations. Historically, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range. Between 2012 and 2014, our common stock traded in a range from $4.49 to $23.20 per share. In 2014, our common stock traded in a range from $5.25 to $7.50 per share. It is likely that the price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate. In particular, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, including: the results of operations, our ability to develop additional products and services, and general market conditions. In addition, the occurrence of any of the risks described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d could have a material and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nA decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital and adversely impact our ability to continue operations.\nAny sudden or prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. Such reductions may force us to\nreallocate funds from other planned uses and may have a significant negative impact on our business plans and operations, including our ability to invest in growing our services, developing our own proprietary technologies and product candidates and continuing our current operations. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital in the future, and we are unable to generate funds from operations sufficient to meet our obligations, we will not have the resources to continue our normal operations.\nImpairment of our intangible assets could result in significant charges that would adversely impact our future operating results.\nWe have significant intangible assets, including goodwill and intangibles with useful lives ranging from 3 to 7 years, which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in various factors or conditions. The most significant intangible assets we have is goodwill as well as developed technology, customer relationships and trade names. We amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight-line or accelerated method, based on the useful life of the asset over which it is expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows. Amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 7 years. We assess the potential impairment of intangible assets on an annual basis, as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that could trigger an impairment of such assets include the following:\n\u2022\nSignificant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;\n\u2022\nSignificant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business;\n\u2022\nSignificant negative industry or economic trends;\n\u2022\nSignificant decline in our stock price for a sustained period;\n\u2022\nChanges in our organization or management reporting structure that could result in additional reporting units, which may require alternative methods of estimating fair values or greater disaggregation in our analysis by reporting unit; and\n\u2022\nA decline in our market capitalization below net book value.\nFuture adverse changes in these or other unforeseeable factors could result in an impairment charge that would impact our results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified.\nOur progesterone delivery patent for CRINONE expired in 2013 in the U.S. and expired in 2014 outside the U.S. and a generic product to CRINONE may become available.\nOur U.S. progesterone delivery patent for the current formulation of CRINONE expired in September 2013. These patent expirations could enable a generic bioadhesive progesterone vaginal gel product to enter the infertility marketplace. Actavis has developed a next generation progesterone product utilizing a new applicator. We have no assurance this development will prevent new competitors from entering the market. However due to the clinical and regulatory hurdles that a potential generic competitor would likely face, we believe the risk of generic entry is not high.\nUntil September 2014, we held patents on the delivery system for CRINONE in the following countries in which sales of CRINONE are material: Australia, Canada, Ireland, Italy, Russia, and the United Kingdom. In other large markets including Brazil, China, India, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and Vietnam there were no patents in place. Merck Serono holds marketing authorizations for CRINONE in over 60 countries outside the United States.\nWe face increased competition, which could adversely affect the operating results of our business\nOur services business competes directly with the in-house research departments of pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, as well as contract research companies, and research and academic institutions. We also experience significant competition from foreign companies operating under lower cost structures. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have. As new companies enter the market and as more advanced technologies become available, we currently expect to face increased competition. In the future, any one of our competitors may develop technological advances that render the services that we provide obsolete. While we plan to develop technologies, which will give us competitive advantages, our competitors plan to do the same. We may not be able to develop the technologies we need to successfully compete in the future, and our competitors may be able to develop such technologies before we do or provide those services at a lower cost. Consequently, we may not be able to successfully compete in the future.\nAny significant change in government regulation of the drug development process could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products is subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities, including the FDA, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (\u201cMHRA\u201d), the European Medicines Agency (\u201cEMA\u201d) and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries. Our business, as well as our customers\u2019 business, depends in part on strict government regulation of the drug development process. Legislation may be introduced and enacted to modify existing regulations or impose new regulations to be administered by the FDA, MHRA or the EMA governing the manufacture of drugs and the drug approval process. Any significant change in regulations governing the manufacture of clinical trial drugs or reduction in the scope of regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures could have a material adverse effect our business.\nWe face significant competition from pharmaceutical companies that may adversely impact our market share.\nOur marketing partners compete against established pharmaceutical companies that market products addressing similar needs. Further, the pharmaceutical development services that we offer are also offered by numerous larger companies that may have better technology, products and services that compete with our present and proposed product and service offerings. Some of these competitors may possess greater financial, research and technical resources than our company or our partners. Moreover, these companies may possess greater marketing capabilities than our company or our partners, including the resources to implement extensive advertising campaigns.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is subject to change as new drug delivery technologies are developed, new products enter the market, generic versions of existing drugs become available, and service and technology offerings evolve to reflect these and other medical research discoveries. We face significant competition in all areas of our business. The rapid pace of change in the pharmaceutical industry continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and start-ups, and can quickly render existing products and services less valuable. Customer requirements and physician and patient preferences continually change as new treatment options emerge, are more or less heavily promoted, and become less expensive. As a result, we may not gain, and may lose, market share.\nThe loss of our key executives could have a significant impact on us.\nOur success depends in large part upon the abilities and continued service of our executive officers and other key employees. Our employment agreements with our executive officers are terminable by either party on short notice. The loss of key employees may result in a significant loss in the knowledge and experience that we, as an organization, possess, and could cause significant delays in, or outright failure of, the management of our\nsupply chain, our pharmaceutical development, analytical and consulting services business and, or, our development of future products and product candidates. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified and talented senior management personnel, our business may suffer.\nOur products could demonstrate hormone replacement risks.\nIn the past, certain studies of female hormone replacement therapy products, such as estrogen, have reported an increase in health risks. Progesterone is a natural female hormone present at normal levels in most women throughout their lifetimes. However, some women require progesterone supplementation due to a natural or chemical-related progesterone deficiency. It is possible that data suggesting risks or problems may come to light in the future that could demonstrate a health risk associated with progesterone or progestin supplementation or CRINONE. It is also possible that future study results for hormone replacement therapy could be negative and could result in negative publicity about the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy. As a result, physicians and patients may not wish to prescribe or use progestins, including CRINONE.\nHealthcare insurers and other payors may not pay for our products or may impose limits on reimbursement.\nThe ability of our partners to commercialize our prescription products will depend, in part, on the extent to which reimbursement for our products is available from third-party payors, such as health maintenance organizations, health insurers and other public and private payors. If we or our partners succeed in bringing new prescription products to market or expand the approved label for existing products, we cannot be assured that third-party payors will pay for such products, or establish and maintain price levels sufficient for realization of an appropriate return on our investment in product development.\nGovernment health agencies, private health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors may use one or more tools including price controls, profit or reimbursement caps, and use of formularies, or lists of drugs for which coverage is provided under a healthcare benefit plan, to control the costs of prescription drugs. Each payor that maintains a drug formulary makes its own determination as to whether a new drug will be added to the formulary and whether particular drugs in a therapeutic class will have preferred status over other drugs in the same class. This determination often involves an assessment of the clinical appropriateness of the drug and, in some cases, the cost of the drug in comparison to alternative products. Our products marketed by our partners from which we derive sales revenues and royalties may not be added to payors\u2019 formularies, our products may not have preferred status to alternative therapies, and formulary decisions may not be conducted in a timely manner. Once reimbursement at an agreed level is approved by a payor organization, reimbursement may be lost entirely or be reduced compared to competitive products. As reimbursement is often approved for a period of time, this risk is greater at the end of the time period, if any, for which the reimbursement was approved. Our partners may also decide to enter into discount or formulary fee arrangements with payors, which could result in lower or discounted prices for CRINONE or future products.\nHealthcare law and policy changes, based on recently enacted legislation, may have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, PPACA, became law in the U.S. PPACA substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affects the pharmaceutical industry. Most notably, the PPACA increased Medicaid rebates, expanded Medicaid eligibility, extended Public Health Service eligibility, imposed annual reporting requirements on certain entities, including pharmaceutical companies, to disclose certain financial relationships with physicians and teaching hospitals, and established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, an entity charged with examining the relative health outcomes, clinical, effectiveness and appropriateness of difficult medical treatments. Many of these provisions could have the effect of reducing our revenue generated by Actavis\u2019 sales of CRINONE and any future commercial products we may develop. In addition, we anticipate that the PPACA, as well as other\nhealthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and an additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, which may harm our business. Insurers may also refuse to provide any coverage of uses of approved products for medical indications other than those for which the FDA has granted market approvals.\nWe are dependent on single-source third-party suppliers of raw materials for our products, the loss of whom could impair our ability to manufacture and sell our products.\nMedical grade, cross-linked polycarbophil, the polymer used in our BDS-based products is currently available from only one supplier, Lubrizol. We believe that Lubrizol will supply as much of the material as we require because our products rank among the highest value-added uses of the polymer. In the event that Lubrizol cannot or will not supply enough of the product to satisfy our needs, we will be required to seek alternative sources of polycarbophil. An alternative source of polycarbophil may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all, which would impair our ability to manufacture and sell our products. While we purchase polycarbophil from Lubrizol, Inc. from time to time, we do not have an agreement with them concerning future purchases. The Company\u2019s policy is to have in inventory at least a 12 month supply of polycarbophil.\nOnly one supplier of progesterone is approved by regulatory authorities outside the U.S. If this supplier is unable or unwilling to satisfy our needs, we will be required to seek alternative sources of supply. While alternative sources of progesterone exist, the time needed to obtain regulatory approvals for new suppliers may impair our ability to manufacture and sell our products.\nWe are dependent upon single-source third-party manufacturers, the loss of which could result in a loss of revenues.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture our products, including Fleet, which manufacturers CRINONE in bulk, Maropack, which fills CRINONE into applicators, and Central Pharma, which packages CRINONE in final containers. These third parties may not be able to satisfy our needs in the future, and we may not be able to find or obtain approval from regulatory authorities of alternate developers and manufacturers. Delays in the manufacture of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business. This reliance on third parties could have an adverse effect on our profit margins. Any interruption in the manufacture of our products would impair our ability to deliver our products to customers on a timely and competitive basis, and could result in the loss of revenues.\nWe may be exposed to product liability claims.\nWe could be exposed to future product liability claims by consumers. Although we presently maintain product liability insurance coverage at what we believe is a commercially reasonable level, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all possible liabilities. An award against us in an amount greater than our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nSteps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights might not be adequate; in which case, competitors may infringe on our rights or develop similar products. The U.S. and foreign patents upon which our original BDS was based have expired.\nOur success and competitive position are partially dependent on our ability to protect our proprietary position for our technology, products and product candidates. We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, third-party confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, and other methods to protect our proprietary rights. The steps we take to protect our proprietary rights, may not be adequate. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our patents, copyrights, trademarks, and similar proprietary rights. Moreover, we may not be able or willing, for financial, legal or other reasons, to enforce our rights.\nBio-Mimetics, Inc. (\u201cBio-Mimetics\u201d) originally held the patent upon which our original BDS was based until we purchased it from them. Bio-Mimetics\u2019 patent contained broad claims covering controlled release products, which include a bioadhesive. However, this U.S. patent and its corresponding foreign patents expired in November 2003 and 2004, respectively. Based upon the expiration of the original Bio-Mimetics patent, other parties will be permitted to make, use or sell products covered by the claims of the Bio-Mimetics patent, subject to other patents, including those which we hold. We have obtained numerous patents with claims covering improved methods of formulating and delivering therapeutic compounds using the BDS. The formulation patents relating to CRINONE expired in 2013 in the U.S. and in 2014 in the rest of the world. We cannot assure you that any remaining patents will enable us to prevent infringement, or that our competitors will not develop alternative methods of delivering compounds, potentially resulting in competitive products outside the protection that may be afforded by our patents. Other companies may independently develop or obtain patent or similar rights to equivalent or superior technologies or processes. Additionally, although we believe that our patented technology has been independently developed and does not infringe on the proprietary rights of others, we cannot assure you that our products do not and will not infringe on the proprietary rights of others. In the event of infringement, we may be required to modify our technology or products, obtain licenses or pay license fees. We may not be able to do so in a timely manner or upon acceptable terms and conditions. This may have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nThe standards that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. Limitations on patent protection in some countries outside the U.S., and the differences in what constitutes patentable subject matter in these countries, may limit the protection we seek outside of the U.S. For example, methods of treating humans are not patentable subject matter in many countries outside of the U.S. In addition, laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as would laws of the U.S. In determining whether or not to seek a patent or to license any patent in a particular foreign country, we weigh the relevant costs and benefits, and consider, among other things, the market potential of our product candidates in the jurisdiction and the scope and enforceability of patent protection afforded by the law of the jurisdiction.\nOur products are subject to government regulation, which could affect our partners\u2019 ability to sell products.\nNearly every aspect of the development, manufacture and commercialization of pharmaceutical products is subject to time-consuming and costly regulation by various governmental entities, including the FDA and MHRA, as well as regulatory agencies in those foreign countries in which our products are manufactured or distributed. The National Drug agencies may have the power to seize adulterated or misbranded products and unapproved new drugs, to require their recall from the market, to enjoin further manufacture or sale, and to publicize certain facts concerning a product.\nWe employ various quality control measures in our efforts to ensure that our products conform to their intended specifications and meet the standards required under applicable governmental regulations. Notwithstanding our efforts, our products or the ingredients we purchase from our suppliers for inclusion in our products may contain undetected defects or non-conformities with specifications. Such defects or non-conformities could compel us to recall the affected product, make changes to or restrict distribution of the product, or take other remedial actions. The occurrence of such events may harm our relations with or result in the loss of customers, injure our reputation, impair market acceptance of our products, harm our financial results, and, in certain circumstances, expose us to product liability or other claims.\nThe potential development of our pharmaceutical products is uncertain and subject to a number of significant risks.\nIn order to develop future pharmaceutical products, we must complete extensive human clinical trials and non-clinical trials that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product in order to apply for regulatory approval to market the product.\nThe process of developing product candidates involves a degree of risk and may take several years. Product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for several reasons, including:\n\u2022\nClinical trials may show our product candidates to be ineffective for the indications studied or to have harmful side effects;\n\u2022\nProduct candidates may fail to receive regulatory approvals required to bring the products to market;\n\u2022\nManufacturing costs or other factors may make our product candidates uneconomical;\n\u2022\nThe proprietary rights of others and their competing products and technologies may prevent our product candidates from being effectively commercialized; and\n\u2022\nOur inability to attract development and commercialization partners.\nSuccess in early clinical trials does not ensure that subsequent large-scale clinical trials will be successful. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals.\nThe length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by a regulatory authority varies significantly and may be difficult to predict. The speed with which we can complete clinical trials and applications for marketing approval will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nThe rate of patient enrollment which is a function of factors including the size of the patient population, competing clinical studies, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the study, and the nature of the study protocol;\n\u2022\nInstitutional Review Board, or IRB, approval of the study protocol and the informed consent form;\n\u2022\nPrior regulatory agency review and approval;\n\u2022\nAnalysis of data obtained from clinical activities, which are susceptible to varying interpretations and which interpretations could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nChanges in the policies of regulatory authorities for drug approval during the period of product development; and\n\u2022\nThe availability of skilled and experienced staff to conduct and monitor clinical studies and to prepare the appropriate regulatory applications.\n\u2022\nSufficient safety and efficacy results of any non-clinical trials conducted.\nIn addition, developing product candidates is very expensive. Factors affecting our product development expenses include:\n\u2022\nOur ability to raise any additional funds, if needed, to complete our trials;\n\u2022\nThe number and outcome of clinical trials conducted by us and/or our collaborators;\n\u2022\nThe number of products we may have in clinical development;\n\u2022\nIn-licensing or other partnership activities, including the timing and amount of related development funding, license fees or milestone payments; and\n\u2022\nFuture levels of our revenue.\nClinical trials are expensive and can take years to complete, and there is no guarantee that the clinical trials will demonstrate sufficient safety and/or efficacy of the products to meet FDA requirements, or those of foreign regulatory authorities.\nDelays or failures in obtaining regulatory approvals may delay or prevent marketing of the products that we develop.\nThe regulatory approval process typically is extremely expensive, takes many years, and the timing or likelihood of any approval cannot be accurately predicted. Delays in obtaining regulatory approval can be extremely costly in terms of lost sales opportunities and increased clinical trial costs. If we or our partners fail to obtain regulatory approval for our future product candidates or expanded indications for currently marketed products, we will be unable to receive income from the sale of such products and indications.\nAs part of the regulatory approval process, we must conduct clinical trials for each product candidate to demonstrate safety and efficacy. The number of clinical trials that will be required varies depending on the product candidate, the indication being evaluated, the trial results, and the regulations applicable to such particular product candidate.\nThe results of initial clinical trials of product candidates do not necessarily predict the results of later-stage clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through initial clinical trials. The data collected from the clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support FDA or other regulatory approval. In addition, the continuation of a particular study after review by an IRB or independent data safety monitoring board does not necessarily indicate that a product candidate will achieve the clinical endpoint.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies can delay, limit or deny approval for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nA product candidate may not be deemed to be safe or effective;\n\u2022\nThe manufacturing processes or facilities selected may not meet the applicable requirements; and\n\u2022\nChanges in their approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional clinical trials, other data or removal from the market.\nAny delay in, or failure to receive, approval for any of our product candidates could prevent us from growing our revenues.\nWe may observe adverse side effects of our future potential product candidates in clinical trials, which could delay or halt product development.\nOur future potential product candidates may demonstrate serious adverse side effects in clinical trials. These adverse side effects could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials of product candidates and could result in FDA or other regulatory authorities denying approval of product candidates for any or all targeted indications. An IRB or independent data safety monitoring board, the FDA, other regulatory authorities, or we ourselves or our customers may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time. Product candidates may prove not to be safe for human use. In such circumstances we may not be able to complete development and successful licensing of our own internal programs and our customers may not place additional contracts with us and may cancel existing contracts.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting.\nWe are required by the SEC to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. We are likewise required, on an annual basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses in our internal controls.\nAs described in Item 9a of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management recently identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, relating to our evaluation of revenue recognition for services transactions and contractual arrangements during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWe are actively engaged in developing a remediation plan designed to address the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Our plan includes additional staffing, enhancing policies and procedures relating to revenue recognition and other areas reflected in the material weakness, and implementing a series of incremental software solutions. These steps, however, may not be sufficient to remediate the material weakness, even if successfully implemented.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be successful in remediating this material weakness or that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Any failure to implement and document new and more precise monitoring controls or to implement organizational changes including skillset enhancements through resource changes or education to improve detection and communication of financial misstatements across all levels of the organization could result in additional material weaknesses, result in material misstatements in our financial statements and cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, which in turn could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nWe may be limited in our use of our net operating loss carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had certain net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $160 million that may be used to reduce our future U.S. federal income tax liabilities, if we become profitable on a federal income tax basis. If unused, these tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire between 2018 and 2034. Our ability to use these loss carryforwards to reduce our future U.S. federal income tax liabilities could also be lost if we were to experience more than a 50% change in ownership within the meaning of Section 382(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (\u201cCode\u201d), as amended. If we were to lose the benefits of these loss carryforwards, our future earnings and cash resources would be materially and adversely affected.\nOn January 22, 2015, our Board of Directors adopted an amendment and restatement of the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, dated as of November 29, 2010 (the \u201cRights Plan\u201d), between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as successor rights agent (as amended and restated, the \u201cAmended Rights Plan\u201d). We adopted the Rights Plan to preserve the value of our net operating loss carry forwards by reducing the likelihood that the Company would experience an ownership change by discouraging any person (together with such person\u2019s affiliates and associates), without the approval of the Board of Directors, (i) from acquiring 4.99% or more of the outstanding Voting Stock (as defined in the Rights Plan) and (ii) that currently beneficially owns 4.99% or more of the outstanding Voting Stock from acquiring more shares of Voting Stock, other than by exercise or conversion of currently existing warrants, convertible securities or other equity-linked securities. In general, the Amended Rights Plan leaves the Rights Plan unchanged in all material respects, other than increasing from 4.99% or more to 9.99% or more the percentage of outstanding shares of Voting Stock that a Person must Beneficially Own (as defined in the Amended Rights Plan) in order to qualify as an \u201cAcquiring Person\u201d for purposes of triggering the Rights (as defined in the Amended Rights Plan) under the Amended Rights Plan. The Amended Rights Plan expires on July 3, 2016.\nThere is no guarantee that the Rights Plan will prevent an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382(g) of the Internal Revenue Code and, therefore, no guarantee that the value of our net operating loss carryforwards will be preserved.\nSales of large amounts of our common stock may adversely affect our market price. The issuance of preferred stock or convertible debt may adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders.\nAs of February 27, 2015, we had 10,775,101 shares of common stock outstanding, of which 10,135,507 shares were freely tradable. As of that date, approximately 639,594 shares of our common stock were held by affiliates. We also have the following securities outstanding: series B convertible preferred stock, contingently redeemable series C convertible preferred stock, common stock warrants, treasury shares, and options. If all of these securities are exercised or converted, an additional 3.1 million shares of our common stock will be outstanding, all of which will be available for resale under the Securities Act. The exercise and conversion of these securities would likely dilute the book value per share of our common stock. In addition, the existence of these securities may adversely affect the terms on which we can obtain additional equity financing.\nIn March 2002, our Board of Directors authorized shares of series D junior participating preferred stock in connection with its adoption of a stockholder rights plan (as discussed above, this plan was amended and restated on November 29, 2010 and subsequently on January 28, 2015), under which we issued rights to purchase series D convertible preferred stock to holders of our common stock. Upon certain triggering events, such rights become exercisable to purchase shares of our common stock (or, in the discretion of our Board of Directors, series D convertible preferred stock) at a price substantially discounted from the then current market price of our common stock.\nUnder our certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 1.0 million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders. In addition, we may issue convertible debt without shareholder approval. The rights of the holders of our common stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock or convertible debt that may be issued in the future. While we have no present intention to authorize or issue any additional series of preferred stock or convertible debt, such preferred stock or convertible debt, if authorized and issued, may have other rights, including economic rights senior to our common stock, and, as a result, their issuance could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.\nOur corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable regulations.\nWe are a small company and we rely heavily on third parties to conduct many important functions. As a pharmaceutical development and services company, we are subject to a large body of legal and regulatory requirements. In addition, as a publicly traded company we are subject to significant regulations. We cannot assure you that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable laws and regulations. Failure to comply with all potentially applicable laws and regulations could lead to the imposition of fines, cause the value of our common stock to decline, impede our ability to raise capital or lead to the de-listing of our stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions could impede or discourage a third-party acquisition of the Company. This could prevent stockholders from receiving a premium over market price for their stock.\nWe are a Delaware corporation. Anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various obstacles to the ability of a third party to acquire control of our company, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our Board of Directors has adopted a stockholder rights plan (as discussed above, this plan was amended and restated on November 29, 2010 and subsequently on January 28, 2015) and has designated a series of preferred stock that could be used defensively if a takeover is threatened. Our incorporation under Delaware law, our stockholder rights plan, and our ability to issue additional series of preferred stock, could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving our company or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock. This could reduce the market\nvalue of our common stock if investors view these factors as preventing stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares.\nOur operations involve hazardous materials and are subject to environmental, health and safety controls and regulations.\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the use of hazardous materials, and we spend considerable time complying with such laws and regulations. Our business activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and although we take precautions to prevent accidental contamination or injury from these materials, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of using these materials. In the event of an accident or environmental discharge, we may be held liable for any resulting damages, which may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates.\nWith four international subsidiaries and third party manufacturers in Europe, economic and political developments in the European Union can have a significant impact on our business. All of our products are currently manufactured in Europe. We are exposed to currency fluctuations related to payment for the manufacture of our products in Euros, Pound Sterling, Swiss Francs, and other currencies and selling them in U.S. dollars and other currencies.\nWe could be negatively impacted by securities class action complaints.\nBetween February 1, 2012 and February 6, 2012, two putative securities class action complaints were filed against Columbia and certain of its officers and directors in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. These actions were filed under the captions Wright v. Columbia Laboratories, Inc., et al., and Shu v. Columbia Laboratories, Inc., et al. and asserted claims under sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated under the Exchange Act on behalf of an alleged class of purchasers of the common stock during the period from December 6, 2010 through January 20, 2012. Both actions were consolidated into a single proceeding entitled In re Columbia Laboratories, Inc., Securities Litigation, under which Actavis and three of its officers were added as defendants. The Consolidated Amended Complaint alleged that Columbia and two of its officers, one of whom is a director, omitted to state material facts that they were under a duty to disclose, and made materially false and misleading statements that related to the results of Columbia\u2019s PREGNANT study and the likelihood of approval by the FDA of a NDA to market progesterone vaginal gel 8% for the prevention of preterm birth in women with premature cervical shortening. According to the amended complaint, these alleged omissions and misleading statements had the effect of artificially inflating the market price of our common stock. The plaintiffs sought unspecified damages on behalf of the putative class and an award of costs and expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees. On June 11, 2013, the Court dismissed the amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, holding that the plaintiffs did not adequately plead facts supporting an inference of an intent to deceive investors. The Court permitted the plaintiffs to file a second amended complaint, which they did on July 11, 2013. Columbia moved to dismiss the second amended complaint, which the court did on October 21, 2013. The Court ruled that changes the plaintiffs made to their first amended complaint \u201cstill do not create a strong inference that the Defendants acted with an intent to deceive, manipulate or defraud.\u201d The Court ordered that if the plaintiffs sought to attempt to plead a cognizable action in a third amended complaint, they must do so within thirty days and specifically address why the attempt would not be futile. The plaintiffs chose not to file any further amendments and the case was dismissed with prejudice on December 2, 2013. On December 20, 2013, the plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The Court heard oral argument on December 9, 2014. On March 10, 2015, the Court affirmed the dismissal in a written opinion. By rule, the plaintiffs may request a rehearing. Columbia believes that the action is without merit, and intends to defend it vigorously. At this time, it is not possible to determine the likely outcome of, or to estimate the potential liability related to this action, and Columbia has not made any provision for losses in connection with it.", "PERMNO": 12149, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "JNP"}
