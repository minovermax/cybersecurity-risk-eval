{"cik": "1388319", "company": "U.S. Stem Cell, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-07-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risk factors required pursuant to Regulation S-K, Item 503(c) are not required for smaller reporting companies. Accordingly, the Company has determined to provide particular risk factors at this time. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations and financial condition. If any events described in the risk factors actually occur, our business, operating results, prospects and financial condition could be materially harmed. In connection with the forward looking statements that appear elsewhere in this annual report, you should also carefully review the cautionary statement referred to under \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements.\u201d\nSHOULD ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES MATERIALIZE, OR SHOULD THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS OF OUR BUSINESS PROVE INCORRECT, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED, BELIEVED, ESTIMATED, EXPECTED, INTENDED OR PLANNED.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Financing\nWe will need to secure additional financing in 2019 in order to continue to finance our operations. If we are unable to secure additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be forced to curtail or cease our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had a bank overdraft of $1,520 and a working capital deficit (current liabilities in excess of current assets) of $8,684,422. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the net loss was $3,835,337 and net cash used in operating activities was $1,210,994. As such, our existing cash resources are insufficient to finance even our immediate operations. Accordingly, we will need to secure additional sources of capital to develop our business and product candidates as planned. We are seeking substantial additional financing through public and/or private financing, which may include equity and/or debt financings, research grants and through other arrangements, including collaborative arrangements.\nAs part of such efforts, we may seek loans from certain of our executive officers, directors and/or current shareholders. We may also seek to satisfy some of our obligations to the guarantors of our loan with Seaside National Bank & Trust, or the Guarantors, through the issuance of various forms of securities or debt on negotiated terms. On January 3, 2018, the Company renewed the loan with Seaside National Bank and Trust extends the maturity date to May 18, 2020, all other terms and conditions remain unchanged. On May 18, 2020, the Seaside loan was turned into a Demand Note with no fixed maturity date but with a redocumentation requirement every four years. The new redocumentation deadline is May 2022. However, financing and/or alternative arrangements with the Guarantors may not be available when we need it, or may not be available on acceptable terms.\nIf we are unable to secure additional financing in the near term, we may be forced to:\n\u25cf\ncurtail or abandon our existing business plans;\n\u25cf\nreduce our headcount;\n\u25cf\ndefault on our debt obligations;\n\u25cf\nfile for bankruptcy;\n\u25cf\nseek to sell some or all of our assets; and/or\n\u25cf\nCease our operations.\nIf we are forced to take any of these steps, any investment in our common stock may be worthless.\nIf we raise additional capital and/or secure alternative arrangements, with the Guarantors or otherwise, by issuing equity, equity-related or convertible securities, the economic, voting and other rights of our existing shareholders may be diluted, and those newly issued securities may be issued at prices that are a significant discount to current and/or then prevailing market prices. In addition, any such newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of our common stock. If we obtain additional capital through collaborative arrangements, we may be required to relinquish greater rights to our technologies or product candidates than we might otherwise have or become subject to restrictive covenants that may affect our business.\nIndex\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm issued its report dated July 15th, 2021 in connection with the audit of our financial statements as of December 31, 2019, which included an explanatory paragraph describing the existence of conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, the notes to our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 included an explanatory paragraph describing the existence of conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. If we are not able to continue as a going concern, it is likely that holders of our common stock will lose all of their investment. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nWe are a development stage life sciences company with a limited operating history and a history of net losses and negative cash flows from operations. We may never be profitable, and if we incur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations for longer than expected, we may be unable to continue operations.\nWe are a development stage life sciences company and have a limited operating history, limited capital, limited sources of revenue, and have incurred losses since inception. Our operations to date have been limited to organizing our company, developing and engaging in clinical trials of our MyoCell\u2122 product candidate, expanding our pipeline of complementary product candidates through internal development and third party licenses, expanding and strengthening our intellectual property position through internal programs and third party licenses and recruiting management, research and clinical personnel. Consequently, it may be difficult to predict our future success or viability due to our lack of operating history. As of December 31, 2018, we have accumulated a deficit of approximately $133.6 million. Our MyoCell\u2122 product candidate has not received regulatory approval or generated any material revenues and is not expected to generate any material revenues until commercialization of MyoCell, if ever.\nOur ability to continue generating revenues from any of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to successfully complete clinical trials, obtain necessary regulatory approvals and implement our commercialization strategy. In addition, even if we are successful in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals and bringing one or more product candidates to market, we will be subject to the risk that the marketplace will not accept those products. We may, and anticipate that we will need to, transition from a company with a research and development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities and we may not succeed in such a transition.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our product development and commercialization efforts, we are unable to predict the extent of our future losses or when or if we will become profitable. Our failure to successfully commercialize our product candidates or to become and remain profitable could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings and continue our operations.\nRisks Related to Product Development\nAll of our product candidates are in an early stage of development and we may never succeed in developing and/or commercializing them. We depended heavily on the success of our MyoCell\u2122 product candidate. If we are unable to commercialize any of our other product candidates or experience significant delays in doing so, our business may fail.\n\u25cf\nWe have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in our MyoCell\u2122 product candidate and depended heavily on its success. MyoCell\u2122 was in the clinical testing stage of development, although we have suspended work under our clinical trials.\n\u25cf\nWe need to devote significant additional research and development, financial resources and personnel to develop commercially viable products, obtain regulatory approvals and establish a sales and marketing infrastructure.\n\u25cf\nWe are likely to encounter hurdles and unexpected issues as we proceed in the development of our other product candidates. There are many reasons that we may not succeed in our efforts to develop our product candidates, including the possibility that:\n\u25cf\nour product candidates will be deemed ineffective, unsafe or will not receive regulatory approvals;\nIndex\n\u25cf\nour product candidates will be too expensive to manufacture or market or will not achieve broad market acceptance\n\u25cf\nothers will hold proprietary rights that will prevent us from marketing our product candidates; or\n\u25cf\nour competitors will market products that are perceived as equivalent or superior.\nOur approach of using cell-based therapy for the treatment of heart damage is risky and unproven and no products using this approach have received regulatory approval in the United States or Europe.\nNo company, to our knowledge, has yet been successful in its efforts to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or Europe of a cell-based therapy product for the treatment of heart damage. Cell-based therapy products, in general, may be susceptible to various risks, including undesirable and unintended side effects, unintended immune system responses, inadequate therapeutic efficacy or other characteristics that may prevent or limit their approval by regulators or commercial use. Many companies in the industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, despite promising results in earlier trials.\nOne of our competitors exploring the use of skeletal myoblasts ceased enrolling new patients in its European Phase II clinical trial based on the determination of its monitoring committee that there was a low likelihood that the trial would result in the hypothesized improvement in heart function. Although our clinical research to date suggests that MyoCell\u2122 may improve the contractile function of the heart, we have not yet been able to demonstrate a mechanism of action and additional research is needed to precisely identify such mechanism.\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration injunction has curtailed our business.\nOn May 9, 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice filed an injunctive action, specifically United States of America v. U.S. Stem Clinic, LLC, U.S. Stem Cell, Inc., Kristin C. Comella, and Theodore Gradel. The Complaint was filed at the request of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and alleges that the respective defendants manufacture \u201cstromal vascular fraction\u201d (SVF) products from patient adipose (fat) tissue, which the companies then market as stem cell-based treatments without first obtaining what the government alleges are necessary FDA approvals. The Company retained counsel to defend in this action. On June 25, 2019, the federal court for the Southern District of Florida ruled in favor of the government, enjoining the Company and the other defendants from certain product sales and processes. The Company filed an appeal on August 23, 2019 and attended oral argument on January 13, 2021. On June 2, 2021, the Eleventh Circuit Court ruled to affirm lower courts\u2019 judgement. The Company did not challenge the district court\u2019s judgment upon any other ground. The Company is not able to predict the duration, scope, results, or consequences of the U.S. Department of Justice actions and final rulings and management is assessing its options on a going forward basis.\nHealthcare reform could substantially reduce our revenues, earnings and cash flows.\nWe cannot predict how employers, private payors or persons buying insurance might react to the changes brought on by broad U.S. healthcare reform legislation or what form many of these regulations will take before implementation. The healthcare reform legislation, enacted in 2010, introduced healthcare insurance exchanges which provide a marketplace for eligible individuals and small employers to purchase healthcare insurance. While patients have begun receiving insurance coverage through these exchanges, the business and regulatory environment for these exchanges continues to evolve as the exchanges mature. Additionally, there is uncertainty about how the applicable state and federal agencies will enforce regulations relating to the exchanges. There is also a considerable amount of uncertainty as to the prospective implementation of the federal healthcare reform legislation and what similar measures might be enacted at the state level. There have been multiple attempts through legislative action and legal challenges to repeal or amend the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as modified by the Health Reform Acts, including the case that was recently heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, King v. Burwell. Although the Supreme Court upheld the provision by the federal government of subsidies to individuals in federally facilitated healthcare exchanges in Burwell, which ultimately did not disrupt significantly the implementation of the healthcare reform legislation, we cannot predict whether other current or future efforts to repeal or amend these laws will be successful, nor can we predict the impact that such a repeal or amendment would have on our business and operations, or on our revenues and earnings. In addition, in the last year, the executive branch and Congress have taken actions to weaken or modify the Affordable Care Act. The enacted reforms, future legislative changes, as well as current ongoing uncertainty in matters related to the Affordable Care Act, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIndex\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock may be considered a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d and thereby be subject to additional sale and trading regulations that may make it more difficult to sell.\nOur common stock is considered to be a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d It does not qualify for one of the exemptions from the definition of \u201cpenny stock\u201d under Section 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act. Our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d because it meets one or more of the following conditions (i) the stock trades at a price less than $5.00 per share; (ii) it is not traded on a \u201crecognized\u201d national exchange or (iii) it is not quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market, or has a price less than $5.00 per share. The principal result or effect of being designated a \u201cpenny stock\u201d is that securities broker-dealers participating in sales of our common stock are subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d regulations set forth in Rules 15-2 through 15g-9 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act. For example, Rule 15g-2 requires broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document at least two business days before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investor\u2019s account. Moreover, Rule 15g-9 requires broker-dealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in such stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor. This procedure requires the broker-dealer to (i) obtain from the investor information concerning his or her financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives; (ii) reasonably determine, based on that information, that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for the investor and that the investor has sufficient knowledge and experience as to be reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of penny stock transactions; (iii) provide the investor with a written statement setting forth the basis on which the broker-dealer made the determination in (ii) above; and (iv) receive a signed and dated copy of such statement from the investor, confirming that it accurately reflects the investor\u2019s financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives. Compliance with these requirements may make it more difficult and time consuming for holders of our common stock to resell their shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them in the market or otherwise.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our common shares.\nIn addition to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules described above, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common shares, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares. In addition, there are a limited number of clearing houses that clear \u201cpenny stocks\u201d and those that will clear such stocks may enforce internal time consuming administrative requirements and may arbitrarily determine to refuse to clear any stock.\nRule 144 sales in the future may have a depressive effect on the company\u2019s stock price as an increase in supply of shares for sale, with no corresponding increase in demand will cause prices to fall.\nAll of the outstanding shares of common stock held by the present officers, directors, and affiliate stockholders are \u201crestricted securities\u201d within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As restricted shares, these shares may be resold only pursuant to an effective registration statement or under the requirements of Rule 144 or other applicable exemptions from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 and as required under applicable state securities laws. Rule 144 provides in essence that a person who is an affiliate or officer or director who has held restricted securities for six months may, under certain conditions, sell every three months, in brokerage transactions, a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of 1.0% of a Company\u2019s issued and outstanding common stock. There is no limit on the amount of restricted securities that may be sold by a non-affiliate after the owner has held the restricted securities for a period of six months if the Company is a current reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company, as of the date of this report, not current in its filings but is making efforts to bring the filings current. A sale under Rule 144 or under any other exemption from the Securities Act of 1933, if available, or pursuant to subsequent registration of shares of common stock of present stockholders, may have a depressive effect upon the price of the common stock in any market that may develop. In addition, if we are deemed a shell company pursuant to Section 12(b)-2 of the Act, our \u201crestricted securities\u201d, whether held by affiliates or non-affiliates, may not be re-sold for a period of 12 months following the filing of a Form 10 level disclosure or registration pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933. Currently, we are not current in our report and the exemption to registration required pursuant to Rule 144 is unavailable to our shareholders. While we intend to bring our filings current to permit the use of the exemption to registration required pursuant to Rule 144, there can be no assurances as to timing and subsequent continued filings.\nIndex\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nMaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements. As discussed in Item 9A - \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Form 10-K, we have evaluated our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that they were not effective as of December 31, 2019.\nA material weakness is defined as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses we identified is that we do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control, although the Board of Directors has a separately-designated standing Audit Committee established in accordance with Section 3(a) (58) (A) of the Exchange Act. The members of our Audit Committee are Mr. Borman, who serves as Chairperson of the Audit Committee, Dr. Murphy, and Mr. Anderson. Our Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Borman qualifies as a \u201cfinancial expert\u201d as that term is defined in the rules of the SEC implementing requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness.\nThe Company is committed to remediating its material weaknesses as promptly as possible. Implementation of the Company\u2019s remediation plans has commenced and is being overseen by the board. However, there can be no assurance as to when these material weaknesses will be remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future. Even effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. Any failure to remediate the material weaknesses, or the development of new material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, could result in material misstatements in our financial statements, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. We have identified weaknesses in our internal controls, and we cannot provide assurances that these weaknesses will be effectively remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future.\nIf not remediated, our failure to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and a failure to meet our reporting and financial obligations, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock.\nPublic disclosure requirements and compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance pose challenges for our management team and result in additional expenses and costs which may reduce the focus of management and the profitability of our company.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC regulations, have created uncertainty for public companies and significantly increased the costs and risks associated with accessing the U.S. public markets. Our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards for public companies, which will lead to increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities.\nCOVID-19.\nWe cannot, at this point, determine the extent to which COVID-19 outbreak will impact business or the economy as both are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nIndex\nTHE OUTBREAK OF THE CORONAVIRUS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT SOURCING AND MANUFACTURING OF THE PRODUCTS THAT WE SELL AS WELL AS CONSUMER SPENDING, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, which has and is continuing to spread throughout China and other parts of the world, including the United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of International Concern.\u201d On January 31, 2020, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public health emergency for the United States to aid the U.S. healthcare community in responding to COVID-19, and on March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak as a \u201cpandemic\u201d. The significant outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets worldwide, and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTHE OUTBREAK OF THE COVID-19 MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR MARKET.\nFurther, such risks as described above could also adversely affect our market, resulting in reduced spending in non-COVID-19 health care. Risks related to an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis, such as COVID-19, could also lead to the complete or partial interruption of our operations. The ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of such epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis and actions taken to contain or prevent their further spread, among others. These and other potential impacts of an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis, such as COVID-19, could therefore materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn economic recession had set in from the pandemic in 2020 and into 2021. This outbreak could decrease spending, adversely affect demand for our products, and harm our business and results of operations. It is not possible for us to predict the duration or magnitude of the adverse results of the outbreak or the timing and the degree to which economic recovery will be realized post-pandemic and, consequently, its effects on our business or results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity, at this time. We cannot anticipate the effect that the impairments caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or the degree to which the economy rebounds post-pandemic will have on our fiscal 2021 results, or the effectiveness and distributions of recently announced vaccines and changes to mask mandate policies. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of COVID-19\u2019s impact to our business, consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and our results presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future years.\nTHE OUTBREAK OF COVID-19 HAS RESULTED IN A WIDESPREAD HEALTH CRISIS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ECONOMIES AND FINANCIAL MARKETS WORLDWIDE AND COULD EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE THE RISK FACTORS DESCRIBED HEREIN AND IN OUR PRIOR FILINGS.\nSHOULD ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING RISKS OR UNCERTAINTIES MATERIALIZE, OR SHOULD THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS PROVE INCORRECT, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED, BELIEVED, ESTIMATED, EXPECTED, INTENDED OR PLANNED", "PERMNO": 92554, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "USRM"}
