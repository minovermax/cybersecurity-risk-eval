{"cik": "1434842", "company": "Forbes Energy Services Ltd.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThe following information describes certain significant risks and uncertainties inherent in our business. You should take these risks into account when evaluating us. This section does not describe all risks applicable to us, our industry or our business, and it is intended only as a summary of known material risks that are specific to the Company. You should carefully consider such risks and uncertainties together with the other information contained in this Form 10-K. If any of such risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could be harmed substantially and could differ materially from the plans and other forward-looking statements included in Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and elsewhere herein.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nThe industry in which we operate is highly volatile and dependent on domestic spending by the oil and natural gas industry, and continued and prolonged reductions in oil and natural gas prices and in the overall level of exploration and development activities may further reduce our levels of utilization, demand for our services, or pricing for our services.\nThe levels of utilization, demand, pricing, and terms for oilfield services in our existing or future service areas largely depend upon the level of exploration and development activity for both crude oil and natural gas in the United States. Oil and natural gas industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including oil and natural gas prices, expectations about future oil and natural gas prices, levels of supply and consumer demand, the cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and natural gas, the expected rates of current production, the discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves, available pipeline and other oil and natural gas transportation capacity, political instability in oil and natural gas producing countries, merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers, political, regulatory and economic conditions, and the ability of oil and natural gas companies to raise equity capital or debt financing. Any addition to, or elimination or curtailment of, government incentives for companies involved in the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas could have a significant effect on the oilfield services industry in the United States.\nOur operations may be materially affected by severe weather conditions, such as hurricanes, drought, or extreme temperatures. Such events could result in evacuation of personnel, suspension of operations or damage to equipment and facilities. Damage from adverse weather conditions could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBeginning in October 2014, through 2015 and continuing in 2016, oil prices worldwide have dropped significantly. If the current depressed oil and natural gas prices persist for a prolonged period, or decline further, in addition to cancellations and curtailments that have already taken place, oil and gas exploration and production companies will likely cancel or curtail additional drilling programs and lower production spending on existing wells even more than they have already, thereby further reducing demand for our services. Lower oil and natural gas prices could also cause our customers to seek to terminate, renegotiate, or fail to honor our service contracts.\nA continued and prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise, could materially and adversely affect us by negatively impacting:\n\u2022\nour revenues, cash flows and profitability;\n\u2022\nthe fair market value of our equipment fleet;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional capital to finance our business and make acquisitions, and the cost of that capital;\n\u2022\nthe collectability of our receivables; and\n\u2022\nour ability to retain skilled personnel whom we would need in the event of an upturn in the demand for our services.\nThe ongoing decrease in utilization, demand for our services and pricing has had, and if it continues will continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe extend credit to our customers which presents a risk of non-payment.\nA substantial portion of our accounts receivable are with customers involved in the oil and natural gas industry, whose revenues are affected by fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices, including the recent substantial decline in oil prices.\nCollection of some of these receivables will be more difficult, and due to economic factors affecting this industry, we may experience an increase in uncollectible accounts. Failure to collect a significant level of receivables from one or more customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe may be adversely affected by uncertainty in the global financial markets and any significant softening in the already limited worldwide economic recovery.\nDespite the recent modest global economic recovery, our future results still may be impacted by any significant reversal as well as any further slow down in such recovery or inflation, deflation, or other adverse economic conditions. These conditions may negatively affect us or parties with whom we do business. The impact on such third parties could result in their non-payment or inability to perform obligations owed to us such as the failure of customers to honor their commitments or the failure of major suppliers to complete orders. Additionally, credit market conditions have changed slowing our collection efforts as customers experience increased difficulty in obtaining requisite financing, potentially leading to lost revenue and higher than normal accounts receivable. This will result in greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense. Failure to collect a significant level of receivables from one or more customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nA deterioration of the economic recovery may cause institutional investors to respond to their customers by increasing interest rates, enacting tighter lending standards, or refusing to refinance existing debt upon its maturity or on terms similar to the expiring debt. We may require additional capital in the future. However, due to the above listed factors, we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available, if needed, and, to the extent required, on acceptable terms.\nThe market for oil and natural gas may be adversely affected by global demands to curtail use of such fuels.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas and technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce the demand for oil and other liquid hydrocarbons. We cannot predict the effect of changing demand for oil and natural gas products, and any major changes may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to maintain or increase pricing on our core services.\nWe may periodically seek to increase the prices on our services to offset rising costs or to generate higher returns for our shareholders. However, we operate in a very competitive industry and, as a result, we are not always successful in raising or maintaining our existing prices. Additionally, during periods of increased market demand, a significant amount of new service capacity may enter the market, which also puts pressure on the pricing of our services and limits our ability to increase prices.\nEven when we are able to increase our prices, we may not be able to do so at a rate that is sufficient to offset such rising costs. In periods of high demand for oilfield services, a tighter labor market may result in higher labor costs. During such periods, our labor costs could increase at a greater rate than our ability to raise prices for our services. Also, we may not be able to successfully increase prices without adversely affecting our activity levels. The inability to maintain or increase our pricing as costs increase could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations.\nOur customer base is concentrated within the oil and natural gas production industry and loss of a significant customer could cause our revenue to decline substantially.\nWe served in excess of 700 customers for the year ended December 31, 2015 and over 1,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. For those same time periods, our largest customer comprised approximately 17.2% and 18.8%, respectively, of our total revenues, our five largest customers comprised approximately 48.5% and 42.7%, respectively, of our total revenues, and our top ten customers comprised approximately 67.0% and 56.6%, respectively, of our total revenues. Our top 100 customers amounted to 95.4% and 91.5% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The loss of our top customer or of several of our top customers would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. We may be able to replace customers lost with other customers, but there can be no assurance that lost revenues could be replaced in a timely manner with the same margins or, perhaps, at all.\nOur indebtedness and operating lease commitments could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our long-term debt, including current portions, was $308.3 million and our annual commitment for operating leases for 2015 was $6.4 million. In the event the decline in activity continues or further declines are encountered, our level of indebtedness and operating lease payment obligations may adversely affect operations and limit our growth. Our level of indebtedness and operating lease payments may affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u2022\nby increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\ndue to the fact that the covenants that are contained in the indenture, or the Senior Indenture, governing our 9% senior notes due 2019, or the 9% Senior Notes, and the loan agreement governing our revolving credit facility limit our ability to borrow funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;\n\u2022\ndue to the fact that any failure to comply with the covenants of our indenture and the loan agreement governing our revolving credit facility (including failure to make the required interest payments) could result in an event of default, which could result in some or all of our indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable; and\n\u2022\ndue to the fact that our level of debt may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes.\nThese restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, and the ability to satisfy the obligations under the Senior Indenture and the loan agreement governing our revolving credit facility. Further, due to cross-default provisions in the Senior Indenture and the loan agreement governing our revolving credit facility, with certain exceptions, a default and acceleration of outstanding debt under one debt agreement would result in the default and possible acceleration of outstanding debt under the other debt agreement. Accordingly, an event of default could result in all or a portion of our outstanding debt under our debt agreements becoming immediately due and payable. If this occurred, we might not be able to obtain waivers or secure alternative financing to satisfy all of our obligations simultaneously, which would adversely affect our business and operations.\nImpairment of our long-term assets may adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.\nLong-term assets consist of property, equipment, and identifiable intangible assets. The Company makes judgments and estimates regarding the carrying value of these assets, including amounts to be capitalized, estimated useful lives, depreciation and amortization methods to be applied, and possible impairment. We evaluate our long-lived assets, at a minimum, annually and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of our net assets may not be recoverable due to various external or internal factors.\nFor property and equipment, events or circumstances indicating possible impairment may include a significant change in the business environment or a significant decline in financial results. For intangible assets, events or circumstances indicating possible impairment may include a significant change in the assessment of future operations or an adverse change in how the asset is being used.\nWhen an indicator of possible impairment exists, we use estimated future undiscounted cash flows to assess recoverability of our long-lived assets. These cash flow projections require us to make judgments regarding long-term forecasts of future revenue and costs related to the assets subject to review. These forecasts include assumptions related to the rates we bill our customers, equipment utilization, equipment additions, staffing levels, pay rates, and other expenses. These forecasts also require assumptions about demand for our products and services, future market conditions, and technological developments. These assumptions considered the drop in oil and natural gas prices over the last eighteen months and projected future pricing trends.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive.\nThe oilfield services industry is highly competitive and we compete with a substantial number of companies, some of which have greater technical and financial resources than we have. Examples of our larger competitors performing both well servicing and fluid logistics are Basic Energy Services, Inc., Superior Energy Services, Inc., Key Energy Services, Inc., and C&J Energy Services, Inc. Our largest competitors that compete only with our fluid logistics segment are Heckman Corporation and Stallion Oilfield Services Ltd. Our ability to generate revenues and earnings depends primarily upon our ability to win bids in competitive bidding processes and to perform awarded projects within estimated times and costs. There can be no assurance that competitors will not substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing of products and services that compete with ours or that new or existing competitors will not enter the various markets in which we are active. In certain aspects of our business, we also compete with a number of small and medium-sized companies that, like us, have certain competitive advantages such as low overhead costs and specialized regional strengths. In addition, reduced levels of activity in the oil and natural gas industry has intensified competition and the pressure on competitive pricing and may result in lower revenues or margins to us.\nCapital Restructurings by our competitors may provide them financial flexibility greater than ours.\nThe oil and natural gas industry has experienced a significant downturn in oil exploration and production activity that began in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continued through 2015 and into 2016. Our business is not immune to such downturn. In response to this significant downturn, many companies are taking steps to de-lever their balance sheets and complete capital restructurings in order to insure that they have the financial flexibility to continue to operate with sufficient liquidity in the longer term. To the extent our competitors successfully pursue capital restructurings, including de-levering of their balance sheets, they may have greater financial flexibility than we do under our existing capital structure. Should our competitors successfully complete any such capital restructurings, the enhanced financial flexibility of our competitors may enable them to compete more effectively with us through the downturn and beyond. Should we take steps to effectuate our own capital restructuring, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete such a capital restructuring on acceptable terms or at all.\nThe Senior Indenture and the loan agreement governing our revolving credit facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us that may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and restrict or limit our ability to operate our business.\nThe Senior Indenture and the loan agreement governing our revolving credit facility contain covenants that restrict or limit our ability to take various actions, such as:\n\u2022\nincurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness or issuing disqualified capital stock;\n\u2022\ncreating or incurring liens;\n\u2022\nengaging in business other than our current business and reasonably related extensions thereof;\n\u2022\nmaking loans and investments;\n\u2022\npaying certain dividends, distributions, redeeming subordinated indebtedness or making other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nincurring dividend or other payment restrictions affecting certain subsidiaries;\n\u2022\ntransferring or selling assets;\n\u2022\nentering into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nconsummating a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets.\nAvailability under our revolving credit facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is based on eligible accounts receivable and the lesser of the net book value or the net orderly liquidation value of certain fixed assets, or the Fixed Asset Valuation. To the extent that our eligible accounts receivable and/or the Fixed Asset Valuation decline, our borrowing base will decrease and the availability under that facility may decrease below its stated amount. In addition, if at any time the amount of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under that facility exceeds the borrowing base, such excess amount will be immediately due and payable.\nThe restrictions contained in the Senior Indenture could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs, or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and adversely affect our ability to fund our operations, enter into acquisitions, or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nWe are subject to the risk of technological obsolescence.\nWe anticipate that our ability to maintain our current business and win new business will depend upon continuous improvements in operating equipment, among other things. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts in this regard or that we will have the resources available to continue to support this need to have our equipment remain technologically up to date and competitive. Our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. No assurances can be given that competitors will not achieve technological advantages over us.\nWe are highly dependent on certain of our officers and key employees.\nOur success is dependent upon our key management, technical and field personnel, especially John E. Crisp, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Charles C. Forbes, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Any loss of the services of either one of these officers, or managers with strong relationships with customers or suppliers, or a sufficient number of other employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. Our ability to expand our services is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain additional qualified employees.\nWe expect that we will continue to incur significant costs as a result of being obligated to comply with Securities Exchange Act reporting requirements, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and our indenture and loan agreement covenants and that our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance matters.\nUnder the Senior Indenture and the loan agreement governing our revolving credit facility, we are required to comply with several covenants, including requirements to deliver certain opinions and certificates, and file reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Our common stock is registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we have reporting requirements under the Exchange Act. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, have imposed various requirements on public companies, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure controls and procedures, internal controls, and corporate governance practices. Accordingly, we expect to continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires, among other things, that we assess internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure. We have performed and will perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In certain prior years our testing revealed, and our future testing may reveal, deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. We expect to continue to incur significant expense and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance, in particular with Section 404. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, if we identify, or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies, possible future deficiencies in our internal controls or if we fail to adequately address future deficiencies, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would entail expenditure of additional financial and management resources. We anticipate that our management and other personnel will continue to devote a substantial amount of time and resources to comply with these requirements.\nWe engage in transactions with related parties and such transactions present possible conflicts of interest that could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe have entered into a significant number of transactions with related parties. The details of certain of these transactions are set forth in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Related party transactions create the possibility of conflicts of interest with regard to our management. Such a conflict could cause an individual in our management to seek to advance his or her economic interests above those of the Company. Further, the appearance of conflicts of interest created by related party transactions could impair the confidence of our investors. Our board of directors has adopted a Related Persons Transaction Policy that requires the Audit Committee to approve or ratify related party transactions that involve consideration in excess of $120,000. Further, as required by the Company\u2019s indenture, we seek the approval of the independent board members when such a related party transaction exceeds an aggregate consideration of $500,000 and an opinion regarding the fairness of such transaction from an outside firm when such a transaction exceeds an aggregate consideration of $2.5 million. Notwithstanding this, it is possible that a conflict of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nActivity in the oilfield services industry is seasonal and may affect our revenues during certain periods.\nOur operations are impacted by seasonal factors. Historically, our business has been negatively impacted during the winter months due to inclement weather, fewer daylight hours, and holidays. Our well servicing rigs are mobile and we operate a significant number of oilfield vehicles. During periods of heavy snow, ice or rain, we may not be able to move our equipment between locations, thereby reducing our ability to generate rig or truck hours. In addition, the majority of our well servicing rigs work only during daylight hours. In the winter months as daylight time becomes shorter, the amount of time that the well servicing rigs work is shortened, which has a negative impact on total hours worked. Finally, we historically have experienced significant slowdown during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday seasons.\nIn addition, the oil and natural gas industry has traditionally been volatile and is influenced by a combination of long-term, short-term and cyclical trends, including the domestic and international supply and demand for oil and natural gas, current and expected future prices for oil and natural gas and the perceived stability and sustainability of those prices. Such cyclical trends also include the resultant levels of cash flows generated and allocated by exploration and production companies to their drilling, completion and workover budget. The volatility of the oil and natural gas industry and the precipitous decline in oil and natural gas prices have negatively impacted the level of exploration and production activity and capital expenditures by our customers. This has adversely affected, and in the future may adversely affect, the demand for our services, which has had, and if it continues, will continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe rely heavily on our suppliers and do not maintain written agreements with any suppliers.\nOur ability to compete and grow will be dependent on our access to equipment, including well servicing rigs, parts, and components, among other things, at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. We do not maintain written agreements with any of our suppliers (other than operating leases for certain equipment), and we are, therefore, dependent on the relationships we maintain with them. Failure of suppliers to deliver such equipment, parts and components at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner would be detrimental to our ability to maintain existing customers and obtain new customers. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in maintaining our required supply of such items.\nWe rely heavily on three suppliers for potassium chloride, a principal raw material that is critical for our operations. While the materials are generally available, if we were to have a problem sourcing these raw materials or transporting these materials from one of these two vendors, our ability to provide some of our services could be limited. Multiple alternate suppliers exist for all other raw materials. The source and supply of materials has been consistent in the past, however, in periods of high industry activity, periodic shortages of certain materials have been experienced and costs have been affected. If current or future suppliers are unable to provide the necessary raw materials, or otherwise fail to deliver products in the quantities required, any resulting delays in the provision of services to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe do not maintain current written agreements with respect to some of our salt water disposal wells.\nOur ability to continue to provide well maintenance services depends on our continued access to salt water disposal wells. Many of our currently active salt water disposal wells are not subject to written operating agreements or are located on the premises of third parties with whom we do not have a current written lease. We do not maintain current written surface leases or right of way agreements with these third parties and we are, therefore, dependent on the relationships we maintain with them. Failure to maintain relationships with these third parties could impair our ability to access and maintain the applicable salt water disposal wells and any well servicing equipment located on their property. If that occurred, we would increase the levels of fluid injection at our remaining salt water disposal wells and would need to use additional third party disposal wells at substantial additional cost. Additionally, our permits to inject fluid into the salt water disposal wells is subject to maximum pressure limitations and if multiple salt water disposal wells became unavailable, this might adversely impact our operations.\nDue to the nature of our business, we may be subject to environmental liability.\nOur business operations and ownership of real property are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, including those relating to emissions to air, discharges to water, treatment, storage and disposal of regulated materials, and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. The nature of our business, including operations at our current and former facilities by prior owners, lessors or operators, exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production, generation, storage, use, transportation, and disposal of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment. Environmental laws and regulations may have a significant effect on the costs of transportation and storage of raw materials as well as the costs of the transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal of wastes. We believe we are in material compliance with applicable environmental and worker health and safety requirements. However, we may incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions, remediation costs, or experience interruptions in our operations for violations or liabilities arising under these laws and regulations. Although we may have the benefit of insurance maintained by our customers or by other third parties or by us such insurances may not cover every expense. Further, we may become liable for damages against which we cannot adequately insure, or against which we may elect not to insure, because of high costs or other reasons.\nOur customers are subject to similar environmental laws and regulations, as well as limits on emissions to the air and discharges into surface and sub-surface waters. Although regulatory developments that may occur in subsequent years could have the effect of reducing industry activity, we cannot predict the nature of any new restrictions or regulations that may be imposed. We may be required to increase operating expenses or capital expenditures in order to comply with any new restrictions or regulations.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our services.\nContinued political attention to issues concerning climate change, the role of human activity in it, and potential mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on our operations and financial results. International agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. These and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies, and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs. Material price increases or incentives to conserve or use\nalternative energy sources could reduce demand for services that we currently provide and adversely affect our operations and financial results. The ultimate financial impact associated with compliance with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction, our activities in those jurisdictions and market conditions.\nSignificant physical effects of climatic change, if they should occur, have the potential to damage oil and natural gas facilities, disrupt production activities and could cause us or our customers to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nIn an interpretative guidance on climate change disclosures, the SEC indicates that climate change could have an effect on the severity of weather (including hurricanes and floods), sea levels, the arability of farmland, and water availability and quality. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations or the assets and operations of our customers. We may not be able to recover through insurance some or any of the damages, losses, or costs that may result should the potential physical effects of climate change occur. Unrecovered damages and losses incurred by our customers could result in decreased demand for our services.\nIncreasing trucking regulations may increase our costs and negatively affect our results of operations.\nIn connection with the services we provide, we operate as a motor carrier and, therefore, are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation, or U.S. DOT, and by various state agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations and regulatory safety. There are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry, including testing and specification of equipment and product handling requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services. Some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations and changes in the regulations that govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period, onboard black box recorder devices, or limits on vehicle weight and size.\nInterstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the U.S. DOT. To a large degree, intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to state safety regulations that mirror federal regulations. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations.\nFrom time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, including proposals to increase federal, state, or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, which may increase our costs or adversely affect the recruitment of drivers. Management cannot predict whether, or in what form, any increase in such taxes applicable to us will be enacted. We may be required to increase operating expenses or capital expenditures in order to comply with any new restrictions or regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive additional governmental regulation.\nIn addition to environmental and trucking regulations, our operations are subject to a variety of other federal, state, and local laws, regulations and guidelines, including laws and regulations relating to health and safety, the conduct of operations, and the manufacture, management, transportation, storage and disposal of certain materials used in our operations. Also, we may become subject to such regulation in any new jurisdiction in which we may operate. We believe that we are in compliance with such laws, regulations and guidelines.\nWe have invested financial and managerial resources to comply with applicable laws, regulations and guidelines and expect to continue to do so in the future. Although regulatory expenditures have not, historically, been material to us, such laws, regulations and guidelines are subject to change. Accordingly, it is impossible for us to predict the cost or effect of such laws, regulations, or guidelines on our future operations.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nAs of January 1, 2016, we had U.S. federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $88.5 million. Generally, net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards, may be used to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce or eliminate U.S. federal income taxes. If we were to experience a change in ownership within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, however, our ability to utilize our NOLs might be significantly limited or possibly eliminated. A change of ownership under Section 382 is defined as a cumulative change of more than 50% in the ownership positions of certain shareholders over a three-year period.\nBased on our review of the issue, we do not believe that we have experienced an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. However, the issuance of additional equity in the future may result in an ownership change pursuant to Section 382 of the Code. In addition, an ownership change under Section 382 could be caused by circumstances beyond our control, such\nas market purchases of our stock or the purchase or sale by significant shareholders. Thus, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an ownership change that would limit our application of our net operating loss carryforwards in calculating future federal tax liabilities.\nOur operations are inherently risky, and insurance may not always be available at commercially justifiable rates or in amounts sufficient to fully protect us.\nWe have an insurance and risk management program in place to protect our assets, operations, and employees. We also have programs in place to address compliance with current safety and regulatory standards. However, our operations are subject to risks inherent in the oilfield services industry, such as equipment defects, malfunctions, failures, accidents, and natural disasters. In addition, hazards such as unusual or unexpected geological formations, pressures, blow-outs, fires, or other conditions may be encountered in drilling and servicing wells, as well as the transportation of fluids and company assets between locations. These risks and hazards could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage or destruction, pollution, and other environmental damages.\nAlthough we have obtained insurance against certain of these risks, such insurance is subject to coverage limits and exclusions and may not be available for the risks and hazards to which we are exposed. In addition, no assurance can be given that such insurance will be adequate to cover our liabilities or will be generally available in the future or, if available, that premiums will be commercially justifiable or that such coverage may not require us to accept additional deductibles. If we were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits, or if we were to incur such liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe cannot predict how an exit by any of our principal founding equity investors could affect our operations or business.\nAs of December 31, 2015, John E. Crisp and Charles C. Forbes, our principal founding equity holders, beneficially owned 6.3% and 12.4%, respectively, of our common stock. Our principal founding equity investors may transfer their interests in us or engage in other business combination transactions with a third party that could result in a change in ownership or a change of control. Any transfer of an equity interest in us or a change of control could affect our governance. We cannot be certain that such equity investors will not sell, transfer, or otherwise modify their ownership interest in us, whether in transactions involving third parties or other investors, nor can we predict how a change of equity investors or change of control would affect our operations or business.\nOur principal founding equity investors control important decisions affecting our governance and our operations, and their interests may differ from those of our other shareholders.\nCircumstances may arise in which the interest of our principal founding equity investors could be in conflict with those of the other shareholders. In particular, our principal founding equity investors may have an interest in pursuing certain strategies or transactions that, in their judgment, enhance the value of their investment in us even though these strategies or transactions may involve risks to other shareholders.\nAlthough Texas corporate law provides certain procedural protections and requires that certain business combinations between us and certain interested or affiliated shareholders meet certain approval requirements, this does not address all conflicts of interest that may arise. For example, our principal founding equity investors and their affiliates are not prohibited from competing with us. Because our principal founding equity investors control us, conflicts of interest arising due to competition between us and a principal founding equity investor could be resolved in a manner adverse to us. It is possible that there will be situations where our principal founding equity investors\u2019 interests are in conflict with our interests, and our principal founding equity investors acting through the board of directors or through our executive officers could resolve these conflicts in a manner adverse to us.\nWe have anti-takeover provisions in our organizational and other documents that may discourage a change of control.\nOur organizational documents contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions provide for the following:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the time period in which directors may be nominated;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to determine the powers, preferences and rights of the preferred stock and to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred or common stock without shareholder approval; and\n\u2022\nrequirements that a majority of the members of our board of directors approve certain corporate transactions.\nWe also have a shareholder rights plan which can make it difficult for anyone to accumulate more than a certain percentage of our outstanding equity without approval of our board of directors. These provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire, control of us, even if the third party\u2019s offer was considered beneficial by many shareholders. As a result, these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of the Company that would otherwise be beneficial to investors.\nFuture legal proceedings could adversely affect us and our operations.\nGiven the nature of our business, we are involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business. While we are not presently a party to any material legal proceedings, legal proceedings could be filed against us in the future. No assurance can be given as to the final outcome of any legal proceedings or that the ultimate resolution of any legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may not be able to fully integrate future acquisitions.\nWe may undertake future acquisitions of businesses and assets in the ordinary course of business. Achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on having the acquired assets perform as expected, successfully consolidating functions, retaining key employees and customer relationships, and integrating operations and procedures in a timely and efficient manner. Such integration may require substantial management effort, time, and resources and may divert management\u2019s focus from other strategic opportunities and operational matters, and ultimately we may fail to realize anticipated benefits of acquisitions.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased cost and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Various governmental entities (within and outside the United States) are in the process of studying, restricting, regulating, or preparing to regulate hydraulic fracturing, directly and indirectly. Hydraulic fracturing operations are regulated through the underground injection control programs under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The EPA has adopted air emissions standards that apply to well completion activities, is developing new standards for wastewater discharges associated with hydraulic fracturing and is conducting a study on the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater. The Bureau of Land Management has also proposed regulations for hydraulic fracturing activities that would be unique to federal lands. Legislation has been introduced before Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In addition, many state governments now require the disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process and some jurisdictions have imposed an express or de facto ban on hydraulic fracturing. A law enacted by the Texas legislature and a rule enacted by The Railroad Commission of Texas in 2011 require disclosure regarding the composition of hydraulic fracturing products to certain parties, including The Railroad Commission of Texas. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for producers to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level, fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting requirements, and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Increased consumer activism against hydraulic fracturing or the prohibition or restriction of hydraulic fracturing on the part of our customers could potentially result in materially reduced demand for the Company\u2019s services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe dividend, liquidation, and redemption rights of the holders of our Series B Senior Convertible Preferred Stock may adversely affect our financial position and the rights of the holders of our common stock.\nWe have shares of Series B Senior Convertible Preferred Stock, or the Series B Preferred Stock, outstanding. We have the obligation to pay to the holders of our Series B Preferred Stock quarterly dividends of five percent per annum of the original issue price, payable quarterly in cash or in-kind. No dividends may be paid to holders of common stock while accumulated dividends remain unpaid on the Series B Preferred Stock. We are current on dividends through the quarterly period ended February 29, 2016.\nFurther, we are required, at the seventh anniversary of the issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock on May 28, 2017, to redeem any such outstanding shares at their original issue price, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends, to be paid, at our election, in cash or shares of common stock (the \"Series B Purchase Price\"). The payment of the redemption price in cash would result in reduced capital resources available to the Company. The payment of the redemption price in shares of common stock would directly dilute the common shareholders. The payment of dividends in-kind would also have a dilutive effect on\nthe common shareholders (as any Series B Preferred Stock issued as dividends would themselves be convertible into common shares). In the event that the Company is liquidated while shares of Series B Preferred Stock is outstanding, holders of the Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive a preferred liquidation distribution, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends, before holders of common stock receive any distributions.\nHolders of the Series B Preferred Stock have certain voting and other rights that may adversely affect holders of our common stock, and the holders of our Series B Preferred Stock may have different interests from, and vote their shares in a manner deemed adverse to, holders of our common stock.\nIn the event that we fail to pay dividends, in cash or in-kind, on the Series B Preferred Stock for an aggregate of at least eight quarterly dividend periods (whether or not consecutive), the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to vote at any meeting of the shareholders with the holders of the common shares and to cast the number of votes equal to the number of shares of whole common stock into which the Series B Preferred Stock held by such holders are then convertible. If the holders of the current Series B Preferred Stock were able to vote pursuant to this provision at this time or converted the Series B Preferred Stock into common stock, we believe that, as of March 30, 2016, those holders would be entitled to an aggregate of 5,292,531 votes resulting from their ownership of Series B Preferred Stock, based on shareholding information provided to us by the current holder of the Series B Preferred Stock. Further, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock may have certain voting rights with respect to the approval of amendments to the certificate of formation of the Company or certain transactions between the Company and affiliate shareholders.\nThe holders of Series B Preferred Stock may have different interests from the holders of our common stock and could vote their shares in a manner deemed adverse to the holders of common stock.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Global Market could result in a delisting of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on The NASDAQ Global Market. To maintain the listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Market, we are required to meet certain listing requirements, including, among others, a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share, a market value of publicly held shares (excluding shares held by our executive officers, directors and 10% or more stockholders) of at least $5 million. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Global Market, NASDAQ may take steps to de-list our common stock. On October 2, 2015, we received a letter from NASDAQ notifying us of a potential delisting of our shares from The NASDAQ Global Market because the closing bid price of our common stock had not met the minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share for the previous 30 consecutive business days. On December 23, 2015, we received a letter from NASDAQ notifying us of a potential delisting of our shares from The NASDAQ Global Market because the market value of publicly held shares for the our common stock was below $5 million for the previous 30 consecutive business days. NASDAQ rules provided us a 180 calendar day grace, or until March 28, 2016, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price per share continued listing requirement and a 180 calendar day grace, or until June 20, 2016, to regain compliance with market value of publicly held shares continued listing requirement.\nWe would regain compliance with the minimum bid price per share continued listing requirement if our common stock has a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days during the 180 calendar day grace period. If we do not regain compliance within such 180-day period, we may transfer our common stock listing to The NASDAQ Capital Market, provided that we (i) meet the applicable market value of publicly held shares requirement for continued listing and all other applicable requirements for initial listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market (except for the closing bid price requirement) based on our most recent public filings and market information and (ii) notify NASDAQ of our intent to cure this deficiency. Following a transfer to The NASDAQ Capital Market, we would be afforded the remainder of an additional 180 calendar day grace period in order to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement of $1.00 per share under The NASDAQ Capital Market, unless it does not appear to NASDAQ that it would be possible for us to cure the deficiency. As further discussed under \u201cRecent Events\u201d on page 24 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, on March 23, 2016, we applied for listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market and notified NASDAQ of our intent to cure the minimum closing bid price requirement by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. In future periods, if we do not meet the minimum closing bid price requirement, the minimum market value of publicly held shares requirement or any other listing requirements, we would be subject to delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market.\nA delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair a shareholder\u2019s ability to sell or purchase our common stock when such shareholder wishes to do so. In the event of a delisting, we would expect to seek to take actions to restore our compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the\nNASDAQ minimum bid price requirement or minimum market value of publicly held shares requirement or prevent future non-compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements.", "PERMNO": 12963, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "FLSS"}
