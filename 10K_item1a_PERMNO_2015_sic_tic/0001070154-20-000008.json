{"cik": "1070154", "company": "STERLING BANCORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nWe are subject to extensive regulatory oversight.\nWe and our subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation. We are supervised and regulated by the Federal Reserve System (the \u201cFederal Reserve\u201d) and the Bank is supervised and regulated by the OCC, as its primary federal regulator, by the FDIC, as the insurer of its deposits, and by the CFPB, which has broad authority to regulate financial service providers and financial products. The application and administration of laws, rules and regulations may vary by such regulators. In addition, we are subject to consolidated capital requirements and must serve as a source of strength to the Bank.\nAs a result, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, undertake new investments and activities and obtain financing. This regulatory structure is designed primarily for the protection of the DIF and our depositors, as well as other consumers, and not to benefit our shareholders. This regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to capital levels, the timing and amount of dividend payments, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes, all of which can have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares. Our regulators have also intensified their focus on bank lending criteria and controls, and on the USA Patriot Act\u2019s anti-money laundering and the Bank Secrecy Act compliance requirements, and there is increased scrutiny of our compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. In order to comply with laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and examination procedures in the anti-money laundering area, we have been required to adopt new policies and procedures and to install new systems. We cannot be certain that the policies, procedures and systems we have in place to ensure compliance are without error, and there is no assurance that in every instance we are in full compliance with these requirements. In addition, emerging technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, could limit our ability to maintain compliance with applicable requirements to track the movement of funds.\nOur failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations could result in a range of sanctions, legal proceedings and enforcement actions, including the imposition of civil monetary penalties, formal agreements and cease and desist orders. In addition, the OCC and the FDIC have specific authority to take \u201cprompt corrective action,\u201d depending on our capital levels. For example, currently, we are considered \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d for prompt corrective action purposes. If we were to be designated by the OCC as \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d we would become subject to additional restrictions and limitations, such as limits on the Bank\u2019s ability to take brokered deposits. If we were to be designated by the OCC in one of the lower capital levels (such as \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d \u201csignificantly undercapitalized\u201d or \u201ccritically undercapitalized\u201d), we would be required to raise additional capital and be subject to progressively more severe restrictions on our operations, and management, including the possible replacement of senior executive officers and directors, capital distributions, and, if we became \u201ccritically undercapitalized,\u201d to the appointment of a conservator or receiver.\nChanges in laws, government rules and regulations and monetary policy may have a material effect on our results of operations.\nFinancial institutions are subject to significant laws, rules and regulations and may be subject to further additional legislation, rulemaking or regulation in the future, none of which is within our control. Significant new laws, rules or regulations or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws, rules or regulations, including, but not limited to, those with respect to federal and state taxation and the Dodd-Frank Act, may cause our results of operations to differ materially. In addition, the costs and burden of compliance with such laws, rules and regulations continue to increase and could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. Further, federal monetary policy significantly affects credit conditions for the Bank, as well as for our borrowers, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve, primarily through open market operations in U.S. government securities, the discount rate for bank borrowings and reserve requirements. A material change in any of these conditions could have a material impact on the Bank or our borrowers, and, as a result, our results of operations.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives to support the financial services industry have been coupled with numerous restrictions and requirements that could detrimentally affect our business.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and legal requirements that govern almost all aspects of our operations, see Item 1 \"Business-Supervision and Regulation.\" One example of this type of federal regulation is the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder which have had, and will continue to have, significant impact on the United States bank regulatory structure and the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies including subjecting the Bank to: (1) the CFPB, which supervises financial institutions such as the Bank that have assets in excess of\n$10 billion, and (2) state consumer protection laws in each state where we do business. CFPB supervision includes compliance with the principal federal consumer protection laws, such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Truth in Savings Act, among others.\nCompliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs, including hiring additional compliance or other personnel and designing and implementing additional internal controls. Further, we may incur compliance-related costs and our regulators may also consider our level of compliance with these regulatory requirements when examining our operations generally or considering any request for regulatory approval we may make, even requests for approvals on unrelated matters. Further, changes in laws, regulations or regulatory policies could adversely affect the operating environment for the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways, increase our cost of doing business, impose new restrictions on the way in which we conduct our operations or add significant operational constraints that might impair our profitability. We cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nBasel III capital rules generally require insured depository institutions and their holding companies to hold more capital, which could limit our ability to pay dividends, engage in share repurchases and pay discretionary bonuses.\nThe Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC adopted final rules for the Basel III capital framework that substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to us. The rules phased in over time, and became fully effective on January 1, 2019. The rules apply to us, as well as to the Bank, and require us to have a CET1 to risk-weighted assets ratio of 7%, a Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.5%, and a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.5%. Failure to satisfy any of these three capital requirements will result in limits on our ability to pay dividends, engage in share repurchases and pay discretionary bonuses. These rules also establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.\nChanges in accounting standards and management's application of those standards could materially impact the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. For example, in June 2016 the FASB issued an accounting standard related to credit losses that became effective for the Company on January 1, 2020. This standard replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology with an expected credit loss methodology and requires consideration of a broader range of information to determine credit loss estimates. Implementation of the standard will likely result in an increase to the allowance for credit losses, with a corresponding negative impact to equity. This increase to the allowance for credit losses will also adversely impact the Company\u2019s regulatory capital position to the extent that the FRB and other U.S. banking agencies do not amend existing regulatory capital rules in a manner that gives appropriate consideration to the loss-absorbing capacity associated with the anticipated increased allowance for credit loss estimate. It is also possible that the Company\u2019s reported earnings and lending activity will be negatively impacted in periods following adoption.\nOur outstanding debt obligations and preferred stock, and our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital and to meet our obligations under our existing indebtedness.\nWe have approximately $2.9 billion in outstanding indebtedness and obligations related to outstanding preferred stock. Our existing debt, together with any future incurrence of additional indebtedness, and outstanding preferred stock, could have important consequences for our creditors and stockholders. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from paying dividends to our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions.\nAn inadequate allowance for loan losses would negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans will not be sufficient to avoid losses. Credit losses are inherent in the lending business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Volatility and deterioration in the broader economy may also increase our risk of credit losses. The determination of an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses is an inherently uncertain process and is based on numerous assumptions. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, that may be beyond our control, and charge-offs may exceed current estimates. We evaluate the\ncollectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate based upon various factors, including, but not limited to: the risk characteristics of various classifications of loans; previous loan loss experience; specific loans that have loss potential; delinquency trends; the estimated fair market value of the collateral; current economic conditions; the views of our regulators; and geographic and industry loan concentrations. If any of our evaluations are incorrect and/or borrower defaults result in losses exceeding our allowance for loan losses, our results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected. We cannot assure you that our allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover probable loan losses inherent in our portfolio.\nThe need to account for assets at market prices may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe report certain assets, including investments and securities, at fair value. Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value, we use quoted market prices, when available, or valuation models that utilize market data inputs to estimate fair value. Because we carry these assets on our books at their fair value, we may incur losses even if the assets in question present minimal credit risk. In addition, we may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairments in future periods with respect to securities in our portfolio. The amount and timing of any impairment recognized will depend on the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of the securities and our estimation of the anticipated recovery period.\nChanges in the value of goodwill and intangible assets could reduce our earnings.\nWe account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), which, in general, requires that goodwill not be amortized, but rather that it be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level, which requires us to recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. Testing for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets is performed annually and involves the identification of reporting units and the estimation of fair values. The estimation of fair values involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity in the assumptions used. Changes in the local and national economy, the federal and state legislative and regulatory environments for financial institutions, the stock market, interest rates and other external factors (such as natural disasters or significant world events) may occur from time to time, often with great unpredictability, and may materially impact the fair value of publicly traded financial institutions, such as us, and could result in an impairment charge at a future date.\nCommercial real estate, commercial & industrial and ADC (as defined below) loans expose us to increased risk and earnings volatility.\nWe consider our commercial real estate loans, commercial & industrial loans and acquisition, development & construction (\u201cADC\u201d) loans to be higher risk categories in our loan portfolio. These loans are particularly sensitive to economic conditions. At December 31, 2019, our portfolio of commercial real estate loans, including multi-family loans, totaled $10.3 billion, or 48.0% of portfolio loans, our commercial & industrial loans (including traditional commercial & industrial, asset-based lending, payroll finance, warehouse lending, factored receivables, equipment finance and public sector finance) totaled $8.2 billion, or 38.4% of portfolio loans, and our ADC loans totaled $467.3 million, or 2.2% of portfolio loans. We plan to continue to emphasize the origination of these types of loans, consistent with our overall business strategy of growing commercial loans, other than ADC loans, where we have ceased originations of land acquisition and development loans. Many of our construction loans are related to affordable housing projects where we are also investing in tax credits. Construction loans are typically made on an exception basis.\nCommercial real estate loans generally involve a higher degree of credit risk than residential loans because they typically have larger balances and are more affected by adverse conditions in the economy. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate often depend on the successful operation and management of the businesses that hold the loans, repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower\u2019s control, such as adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy or changes in government regulation. In the case of commercial & industrial loans, although we strive to maintain high credit standards and limit exposure to any one borrower, the collateral for these loans often consists of accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. This type of collateral typically does not yield substantial recovery in the event we need to foreclose on it and may rapidly deteriorate, disappear, or be misdirected in advance of foreclosure. This adds to the potential that our charge-offs will be more volatile than we have experienced in the past, which could significantly negatively affect our earnings in any quarter. In addition, some of our ADC loans pose higher risk levels than the levels expected at origination, as projects may stall or sell at prices lower than expected. In addition, many of our borrowers also have more than one commercial real estate, commercial & industrial or ADC loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship may expose us to significantly greater risk of loss.\nLoans in our residential mortgage loan portfolio include interest only loans and loans that were originated as interest only loans that have converted to principal amortization status.\nAt December 31, 2019, included in our residential mortgage loan portfolio were $846.6 million of interest only loans and other residential mortgage loans that have converted to principal amortization status. After conversion to principal amortization status, a borrower\u2019s\nmonthly payment may increase substantially and the borrower may not be able to afford the increased debt service, which could result in increased delinquencies and, accordingly, potentially adversely affect our operating results. At December 31, 2019, there were $36.8 million of loans that are interest only or were interest only and have converted to principal amortization status that were in non-accrual status.\nOur continuing concentration of loans in our primary market area may increase our risk.\nOur success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in the counties in which we conduct most of our business. The economic conditions in these counties may be different from, and in some instances worse than, the economic conditions in the United States as a whole. Most of our loans and deposits are generated from customers primarily in the New York Metro Market, which includes Manhattan, the boroughs and Long Island, and certain portions of the New York Suburban Market including Rockland, Westchester and Orange Counties in New York. We also have a presence in Ulster, Sullivan and Putnam Counties in New York and in Bergen County, New Jersey, as well as other counties in northern New Jersey. Our expansion into New York City and continued growth in Westchester County and Bergen County has helped us diversify our geographic concentration with respect to our lending activities but deterioration in economic conditions in our market area would still adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nEnvironmental liability associated with our lending activities could result in losses.\nIn the course of business, we may acquire, through foreclosure, properties securing loans that are in default. Particularly in commercial real estate lending, there is a risk that material environmental violations could be discovered on these properties. In this event, we might be required to remedy these violations at the affected properties at our sole cost and expense. The cost of remedial action could substantially exceed the value of affected properties, we may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties and we could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties. These events could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in market interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by changes in market interest rates. Our results of operations substantially depend on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense that we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. In general, our balance sheet is modestly asset sensitive because our assets mature or re-price at a faster pace than our liabilities. If interest rates continue at existing levels or decline, net interest income would be adversely affected as asset yields would be expected to decline at faster rates than deposit or borrowing costs. A decline in net interest income may also occur if competitive market pressures limit our ability to maintain or lag deposit costs. Wholesale funding costs may also increase at a faster pace than asset re-pricing.\nWe also are subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect the average life of loans and securities. Decreases in interest rates often result in increased prepayments of loans and securities, as borrowers refinance their loans to reduce borrowings costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments in loans or other investments that have interest rates that are comparable to the interest rates on existing loans and securities. Additionally, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and/or may make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the value of our interest earning assets and, in particular, our securities portfolio. The Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate three times in fiscal year 2019. Generally, the value of our securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, our available for sale securities portfolio totaled $3.1 billion. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale could have an adverse effect on stockholders\u2019 equity and comprehensive income.\nUncertainty relating to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR adversely affect our results of operations.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calibration of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based securities and variable rate loans, or other securities or financial arrangements, given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally. The Federal Reserve Board, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing the U.S. dollar LIBOR with a\nnew index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities (\u201cSOFR\u201d). SOFR is observed and backward looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). SOFR is therefore likely to be lower than LIBOR and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions. Whether or not SOFR attains traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question, although some transactions using SOFR were completed in 2019 (including the Company\u2019s issuance of 4.00% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2029), the future of LIBOR remains uncertain at this time. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect LIBOR rates and the value of LIBOR-based loans, and securities in our portfolio. If LIBOR rates are no longer available, and we are required to implement substitute indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our borrowers, we may experience significant expenses in effecting the transition, and may be subject to disputes or litigation with customers and creditors over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory limitations and other limitations, which may affect our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders or to repurchase our common stock.\nWe are a separate legal entity from our subsidiary, the Bank, and we do not have significant operations of our own. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the Bank\u2019s regulators could assert that payment of dividends or other payments may result in an unsafe or unsound practice. In addition, we are subjected to consolidated capital requirements and must serve as a source of strength to the Bank. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to us or we are required to retain capital or contribute capital to the Bank, we may not be able to pay dividends on our common stock or to repurchase shares of common stock.\nWe are subject to laws regarding the privacy, information security and protection of personal information and any violation of these laws or another incident involving personal, confidential or proprietary information of individuals could damage our reputation and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including personally identifiable information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide data services. We are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals (including customers, employees, suppliers and other third parties). For example, our business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which, among other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on our ability to share nonpublic personal information about our customers with nonaffiliated third parties; (ii) requires that we provide certain disclosures to customers about our information collection, sharing and security practices and afford customers the right to \u201copt out\u201d of any information sharing by us with nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions); and (iii) requires that we develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing appropriate safeguards based on our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities, and the sensitivity of customer information we process, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Various state and federal banking regulators and states have also enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Ensuring that our collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information complies with all applicable laws and regulations can increase our costs. Furthermore, we may not be able to ensure that all of our customers, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information that they exchange with us, particularly where such information is transmitted by electronic means. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or others were to be mishandled or misused, we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory sanctions under personal information laws and regulations. Concerns regarding the effectiveness of our measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that such measures are inadequate, could cause us to lose customers or potential customers for our products and services and thereby reduce our revenues. Accordingly, any failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject us to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices or in significant liabilities, fines or penalties, and could damage our reputation and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nA breach, failure or interruption of information security, including as a result of cyber-attacks or other cyber incidents, could negatively affect our earnings or otherwise harm our business.\nIncreasingly, we depend upon data processing, communication and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks, and over the Internet from both internal sources and external, third-party vendors. We devote significant resources and management focus to ensuring the integrity of our systems through information security and business continuity programs, but we may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses,\nor to alleviate problems caused by external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors or other similar events, all of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions like us continue to increase in part because of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others. In addition to cyber-attacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers continue to engage in attacks against large financial institutions including denial of service attacks designed to disrupt external customer facing services, and ransomware attacks designed to deny organizations access to key internal resources or systems. While to date we have not been subject to material cyber-attacks or other cyber incidents, we cannot guarantee all our systems, or the systems of the third-party vendors we rely on, are free from vulnerability to attack, despite safeguards we and our third-party vendors have instituted.\nMoreover, we are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. We employ detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents, but early detection may be thwarted by sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection. Additionally, we face risks related to cyber-attacks and other security breaches in connection with our own and third-party systems, processes and data, including credit card transactions that typically require the transmission of sensitive information regarding our customers through various third parties, including merchant acquiring banks, payment processors, payment card networks and our processors. Some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyber-attacks, and because the transactions involve third parties and environments such as the point of sale that we do not control or secure, future security breaches or cyber-attacks affecting any of these third parties could impact us through no fault of our own, and in some cases we may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks relating to them.\nIf information security is breached, despite the controls we and our third-party vendors have instituted, information can be lost or misappropriated, resulting in financial losses or costs to us or damages to others. These costs or losses could materially exceed the amount of insurance coverage we have, if any, which would adversely affect our earnings. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system breach, failure or service disruption could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation and our relationships with our partners and customers, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile we diligently assess applicable regulatory and legislative developments affecting our business, laws and regulations relating to cybersecurity have been frequently changing, imposing new requirements on us, such as the recently adopted New York State Department of Financial Services\u2019 Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies regulation. In light of these conditions, we face the potential for additional regulatory scrutiny that will lead to increasing compliance and technology expenses and, in some cases, possible limitations on the achievement of our plans for growth and other strategic objectives.\nWe are subject to competition from both banks and non-bank companies.\nThe financial services industry, including commercial banking, is highly competitive, and we encounter strong competition for deposits, loans and other financial services in our market area. Our principal competitors include commercial banks, savings banks and savings and loan associations, mutual funds, money market funds, finance companies, trust companies, insurers, leasing companies, credit unions, mortgage companies, real estate investment trusts (\u201cREITs\u201d), private issuers of debt obligations, venture capital firms, private equity funds and suppliers of other investment alternatives, such as securities firms. Many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulation as we are and thus have advantages over us in providing certain services. Further, many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have greater access to capital and other resources.\nIn addition, financial products and services have become increasingly technology-driven. The adoption of new technologies, including Internet banking services, mobile applications, advanced ATM functionality and cryptocurrencies could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our current products and services or to build new products and services. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively, and in a cost-efficient manner, is dependent on the ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available. Many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technology than we do and may be better equipped to market new technology-driven products and services. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to make opportunistic acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including the risk that regulators will not provide the requisite approvals.\nWe will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and may make opportunistic whole or partial acquisitions of other banks, branches, financial institutions, or related businesses from time to time that we expect may further our business strategy, including through participation in FDIC-assisted acquisitions or assumption of deposits from troubled institutions. Any possible acquisition will be subject to regulatory approval, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such approval in a timely manner or at all. Even if we obtain regulatory approval, these acquisitions could involve numerous risks, including lower than expected performance or higher than expected costs, difficulties related to integration, difficulties and costs associated with consolidation and streamlining inefficiencies, diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business activities, changes in relationships with customers, and the potential loss of key employees. In addition, we may not be successful in identifying acquisition candidates or preventing deposit erosion or loan quality deterioration at acquired institutions. Competition for acquisitions can be highly competitive, and we may not be able to acquire other institutions on attractive terms. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing or will even pursue future acquisitions, or if such transactions are completed, that we will be successful in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations. Our ability to grow may be limited if we choose not to pursue or are unable to successfully make acquisitions in the future.\nThe success of our and the Bank\u2019s mergers and acquisitions may depend, in part, on our ability to realize the estimated cost savings from combining the acquired businesses with our and the Bank\u2019s existing operations. It is possible that the potential cost savings could turn out to be more difficult to achieve than anticipated. The cost savings estimates also depend on our ability to combine the businesses in a manner that permits those cost savings to be realized. If the estimates turn out to be incorrect or if we are unable to successfully execute our strategy for combining businesses, our anticipated cost savings may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nMoreover, although we have successfully integrated business acquisitions in recent years, there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future, which could delay or prevent the anticipated benefits of future acquisitions from being realized fully or at all. In addition, acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and trading value and thus may result in the dilution of our book value per share.\nVarious factors may make takeover attempts more difficult to achieve.\nThe Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) currently has no intention to sell control of the Company. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, federal regulations, Delaware law and various other factors may make it more difficult for companies or persons to acquire control of us without the consent of our Board. A shareholder may want a takeover attempt to succeed because, for example, a potential acquirer could offer a premium over the then prevailing market price of our common stock. The factors that may discourage takeover attempts or make them more difficult include:\n(a) Certificate of incorporation, bylaws and statutory provisions.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may make it more difficult and expensive to pursue a takeover attempt that our Board opposes by making it more difficult to remove our current Board, or to elect new directors. These provisions include limitations on voting rights of beneficial owners of more than 10% of our common stock, supermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations, and plurality voting. Our bylaws also contain provisions regarding the timing and content of stockholder proposals and nominations and qualification for service on the Board.\n(b) Required change in control payments and issuance of stock options and recognition and retention plan shares.\nWe have entered into employment agreements with executive officers, which require payments to be made to them in the event their employment is terminated following a change in control of us or the Bank. We have issued stock grants and stock options in accordance with the 2004 Provident Bancorp Inc. Stock Incentive Plan, the Sterling Bancorp 2014 Stock Incentive Plan, and the Amended and Restated 2015 Omnibus Plan. In the event of a change in control, the vesting of stock and option grants would accelerate. In 2019, we adopted the Sterling National Bank Severance Pay Plan. The plan calls for severance payments ranging from 12 weeks to 36 weeks for employees not covered by separate agreements if they are terminated in connection with a change in control of us.\nOur results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely impacted by issues arising from certain industry deficiencies in foreclosure practices, including delays and challenges in the foreclosure process.\nForeclosure timelines in our principal marketplace are longer than the national average. Residential mortgages, in particular, may present us with foreclosure process issues. For example, residential mortgages were 10.3% of our total portfolio loans as of December\n31, 2019, but constituted 34.8% of our non-accrual loans on the same date. Collateral for many of our residential loans is located within the States of New York and New Jersey, where there may continue to be foreclosure process and timeline issues.\nWe depend on our executive officers and key personnel to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nWe believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our management team and our ability to motivate and retain these individuals and other key personnel. In particular, we rely on the leadership of our Chief Executive Officer, Jack Kopnisky, and our Chief Financial Officer, Luis Massiani, who was also recently appointed President of the Bank. The loss of service of Mr. Kopnisky, Luis Massiani or one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel could reduce our ability to successfully implement our long-term business strategy, our business could suffer, and the value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected. Leadership changes will occur from time to time, and we cannot predict whether significant resignations will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. We believe our management team possesses valuable knowledge about the banking industry and our markets and that their knowledge and relationships would be very difficult to replicate. Although the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other executive officers have entered into employment agreements with us, it is possible that they may not complete the term of their employment agreements or renew them upon expiration. Our success also depends on the experience of our financial center managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve. The loss of these key personnel could negatively impact our banking operations. Further, the loss of key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 86582, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "STL"}
