In light of the ongoing and unprecedented nature of the pandemic, it is difficult to predict its full impact on our business. Future developments, including governmental legislation and other actions, when COVID-19\ncan be controlled, and when the economy may be reopened, are highly uncertain. The COVID-19\nrecession had adverse effects on our operating results for the year ending December 31, 2020 and possibly beyond.\nThe following have or may occur:\n\u2022\na decline in the demand for products and services may occur due to, among other things, adverse financial impacts of the pandemic on customers, increased unemployment and temporary or permanent closures of businesses;\n\u2022\ndeposits could decline if customers need to draw on available balances as a result of the economic downturn;\n\u2022\nan increase in loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures due to, among other things, adverse financial impacts of the pandemic on customers;\n\u2022\na decline in collateral value;\n\u2022\na work stoppage, forced quarantine, or other interruption or the unavailability of key employees has occurred in various areas of the Company and may continue to occur;\n\u2022\nthe unavailability of critical services provided by third party vendors or limitations on the business capacities of our vendors for extended periods of time;\n\u2022\na decline of the yield on our assets to a greater extent than the decline in our cost of interest-bearing liabilities as the result of the reduction of the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s target federal funds rate to near 0%, reducing our net interest margin and spread and reducing net income;\n\u2022\npotential losses in our investment securities portfolio due to volatility in the financial markets;\n\u2022\nincreased cybersecurity risks and a potential loss of productivity in connection with remote work arrangements;\n\u2022\nan increase in the allowance for loan losses has occurred and may continue to occur to accommodate potential increased loan defaults.\nOur participation in the SBA\u2019s PPP may expose us to reputational harm, increased litigation risk, as well as the risk that the SBA may not fund some or all of the guarantees associated with PPP loans.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have originated approximately 1,300 loans aggregating to approximately $232 million through the PPP. Lenders participating in the PPP have faced increased public scrutiny about their loan application process and procedures, and the nature and type of the borrowers receiving PPP loans. We depend on our reputation as a trusted and responsible financial services company to compete effectively in the communities that we serve, and any negative public or customer response to, or any litigation or claims that might arise out of, our participation in the PPP and any other legislative or regulatory initiatives and programs that may be enacted in response to the COVID-19\npandemic, could adversely impact our business. Other larger banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the PPP, and we may be subject to the same or similar litigation, in addition to litigation in connection with our processing of PPP loan forgiveness applications. In addition, if the SBA determines that there is a deficiency in the manner in which a PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by us, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from us.\nBUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND COMPETITION\nWe face significant and increasing competition in the financial services industry.\nThe banking business is highly competitive and the profitability of the Company depends upon the Company\u2019s ability to attract loans and deposits in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Virginia, Washington DC, and Pennsylvania, where the Company competes with a variety of traditional banking companies, some of which have vastly greater resources, and nontraditional institutions such as credit unions and finance companies.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we fail to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services, cryptocurrencies and payment systems, could require substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services as we grow and develop our internet and mobile banking and wealth management channel strategies in addition to remote connectivity solutions. We might not be successful in: developing or introducing new products and services; integrating new products or services into our existing offerings;\nresponding or adapting to changes in consumer behavior, preferences, spending, investing and/or saving habits; achieving market acceptance of our products and services; reducing costs in response to pressures to deliver products and services at lower prices; or sufficiently developing and maintaining loyal customers.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird-party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and core application processing. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, using established criteria and complying with applicable regulatory guidance to evaluate each vendor\u2019s overall risk profile, capabilities, financial stability, and internal control environment, we do not control their daily business environment and actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers, impair our ability to conduct our business efficiently and effectively, and/or result in regulatory action, financial loss, litigation, and loss of reputation. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nBANKING AND MARKET CONDITIONS\nChanges in interest rates may hurt our earnings, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s earnings depend, to a great extent, upon the level of net interest income generated by the Company, and therefore the Company\u2019s results of operations may be adversely affected by increases or decreases in interest rates or by the shape of the yield curve.\nOur loan portfolio is subject to various credit risks.\nAt December 31, 2020, approximately 74.8% of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio was comprised of commercial and commercial real estate loans, exposing the Company to the risks inherent in financings based upon analyses of credit risk, the value of underlying collateral, including real estate, and other more intangible factors, which are considered in making commercial loans.\nAt December 31, 2020, approximately 24.1% of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio was comprised of residential real estate and home equity loans, exposing the Company to the risks inherent in financings based upon analyses of credit risk and the value of underlying collateral. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s profitability may be negatively impacted by errors in risk analyses, by loan defaults and the ability of certain borrowers to repay such loans may be adversely affected by any downturn in general economic conditions.\nChanges in the valuation of our securities could adversely affect us.\nEconomic conditions and interest rate risk could adversely impact the fair value and the ultimate collectability of the Company\u2019s investments. Should an investment be deemed \u201cother than temporarily impaired\u201d, the Company would be required to write-down the carrying value of the investment through earnings. Such write-down(s) may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nImpairment of goodwill and/or intangible assets could adversely affect us.\nWrite-down of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2020, our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were approximately $3.5 million.\nLoan Customers may not be able to repay loans according to their terms.\nThe Company\u2019s loan customers may not repay loans according to their terms, and the collateral securing the payment of loans may be insufficient to assure repayment or cover losses. If loan customers fail to repay loans according to the terms of the loans, the Company may experience significant credit losses which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results and capital ratios.\nChanges to and replacement of the LIBOR Benchmark Interest Rate may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), a regulator of financial services firms in the United Kingdom, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. The FCA and the submitting LIBOR banks have indicated they will support the LIBOR indices through 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate. In the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve. Other financial services regulators and industry groups are evaluating the phase-out\nof LIBOR and the development of alternate reference rate indices or reference rates. The Company has loans, investment securities, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are dependent on LIBOR. Although the Company has incorporated LIBOR replacement language in many of its governing documents, the transition to a new rate will require changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and funding strategies. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of the replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, and what the impact of such a transition will have on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nBUSINESS CONTINUITY AND SECURITY RISKS\nClimate change, severe weather, natural disasters, acts of terrorism and other external events could harm our business.\nNatural disasters, including severe weather events of increasing strength and frequency due to climate change, can disrupt our operations, result in damage to the Company\u2019s properties, reduce or destroy the value of the collateral for the Company\u2019s loans and negatively affect the economies in which the Company operates, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. A significant natural disaster, such as a tornado, hurricane, earthquake, fire or flood, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business, and the Company\u2019s insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate for losses that may occur. Acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest or pandemics, including COVID 19, could cause disruptions to the Company\u2019s business or the economy as a whole. While the Company has established and regularly tests disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement future information technology system enhancements, which could adversely affect our business operations and profitability.\nThe potential need to adapt to industry changes in information technology systems, on which the Company is highly dependent to secure bank and customer financial information, could present operational issues, require significant capital spending or impact the Company\u2019s reputation.\nWe face continuing and growing security risks to our information base, including the information we maintain relating to our customers.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our\nsecurity measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, and damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations and competitive position.\nREGULATORY AND LEGAL\nOur business is highly regulated, and changes in the laws and regulations that apply to us could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe Company is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination. Any change in the laws or regulations or failure by the Company to comply with applicable law and regulation, or a change in regulators\u2019 supervisory policies or examination procedures, whether by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board, other state or federal regulators, the United States Congress, or the Massachusetts legislature could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Changes in accounting policies, practices and standards, as may be adopted by the regulatory agencies as well as the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and other accounting standard setters, could also impact the Company\u2019s financial results.\nAdditionally, changes in the extensive laws, regulations and policies governing companies generally and bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, such as the Act and the Tax Act, could alter the Company\u2019s business environment or affect the Company\u2019s operations.\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and any failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose community investment and nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The CFPB, the Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act or other fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions, restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operation, and financial condition.\nThese factors, as well as general economic and market conditions in the United States of America, may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s performance, results of operations and the market price of shares of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock.", "PERMNO": 11348, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CNBKA"}
