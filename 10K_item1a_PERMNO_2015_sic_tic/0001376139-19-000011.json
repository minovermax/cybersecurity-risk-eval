{"cik": "1376139", "company": "CVR ENERGY INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risks should be considered together with the other information contained in this Report and all of the information set forth in our filings with the SEC. If any of the following risks or uncertainties develops into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. References to CVR Energy, the Company, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, and \u201cour\u201d may refer to consolidated subsidiaries of CVR Energy, including CVR Refining or CVR Partners, as the context may require.\nRisks Related to Our Entire Business\nOur petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer businesses are, and commodity prices are, cyclical and highly volatile, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur petroleum segment\u2019s financial results are primarily affected by margin between refined product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks. Historically, refining margins have been volatile, and we believe they will continue to be volatile in the future. Our cost to acquire feedstocks and the price at which we can ultimately sell refined products depend upon several factors beyond our control, including regional and global supply of and demand for crude oil, gasoline, diesel and other feedstocks and refined products. These in turn depend on, among other things, the availability and quantity of imports, the production levels of U.S. and international suppliers, levels of refined petroleum product inventories, productivity and growth (or the lack thereof) of U.S. and global economies, U.S. relationships with foreign governments, political affairs and the extent of governmental regulation.\nSome of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly, adding to market volatility, while others may have longer-term effects on refining and marketing margins, which are uncertain. We do not produce crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we refine long before we refine them and sell the refined products. Price level changes during the period between purchasing feedstocks and selling the refined petroleum products from these feedstocks could have a significant effect on our financial results. A decline in market prices may negatively impact the carrying value of our inventories.\nOur petroleum segment profitability is also impacted by the ability to purchase crude oil at a discount to benchmark crude oils, such as WTI, as we do not produce any crude oil and must purchase all of the crude oil we refine. Crude oil differentials can fluctuate significantly based upon overall economic and crude oil market conditions. Adverse changes in crude oil differentials can adversely impact refining margins, earnings and cash flows. In addition, the petroleum segment\u2019s purchases of crude oil, although based on WTI prices, have historically been at a discount to WTI because of the proximity of the refineries to the sources, existing logistics infrastructure and quality differences. Any change in the sources of crude oil, infrastructure or logistical improvements or quality differences could result in a reduction of the petroleum segment\u2019s historical discount to WTI and may result in a reduction of the petroleum segment\u2019s cost advantage.\nOur nitrogen fertilizer business is exposed to fluctuations in nitrogen fertilizer demand in the agricultural industry. These fluctuations historically have had and could in the future have significant effects on prices across all nitrogen fertilizer products and, in turn, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nNitrogen fertilizer products are commodities, the price of which can be highly volatile. The prices of nitrogen fertilizer products depend on a number of factors, including general economic conditions, cyclical trends in end-user markets, supply and demand imbalances, governmental policies and weather conditions, which have a greater relevance because of the seasonal nature of fertilizer application. If seasonal demand exceeds the projections on which we base our production levels, customers may acquire nitrogen fertilizer products from competitors, and our profitability may be negatively impacted. If seasonal demand is less than expected, we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored or liquidated.\nDemand for nitrogen fertilizer products is dependent on demand for crop nutrients by the global agricultural industry. The international market for nitrogen fertilizers is influenced by such factors as the relative value of the U.S. dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing nitrogen fertilizers, foreign agricultural policies, the existence of, or changes in, import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets, changes in the hard currency demands of certain countries and other regulatory policies of foreign governments, as well as the laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade and investment. Nitrogen-based fertilizers remain solidly in demand, driven by a growing world population, changes in dietary habits and an expanded use of corn for the production of ethanol. Supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates, raw material costs, government policies and global trade. A decrease in nitrogen fertilizer prices would have a material adverse effect on our nitrogen fertilizer business and cash flow, including CVR Partners\u2019 ability to make distributions.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 22\nAdditionally, volatile prices for natural gas and electricity affect both segments\u2019 manufacturing and operating costs. Natural gas and electricity prices have been, and will continue to be, affected by supply and demand for fuel and utility services in both local and regional markets.\nPetroleum and nitrogen fertilizer products are global commodities, and our businesses face intense competition from other refining and marketing companies and nitrogen fertilizer producers, which may have more resources and scale.\nThe refining industry is highly competitive with respect to both crude oil and other feedstock supply and refined petroleum product markets. We compete with many companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for sites for our refined petroleum products. The petroleum segment is not engaged in the petroleum exploration and production business and therefore it does not produce any of its crude oil feedstocks. Many of our competitors, however, obtain a significant portion of their feedstocks from company-owned production and some have extensive retail sites. Such competitors are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages. Some of our competitors also have materially greater financial and other resources than we have. Such competitors have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our industry. In addition, we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial, commercial, and individual consumers.\nThe refining industry is highly competitive with respect to both crude oil and other feedstock supply and refined product markets. Our petroleum business may be unable to compete effectively with competitors within and outside of the industry, which could result in reduced profitability. We compete with numerous other companies for available supplies of crude oil and other feedstocks and for outlets for refined products. We do not have a retail business and therefore are dependent upon others for outlets for our refined products. We do not have arrangements exceeding more than a twelve-month period for much of our petroleum output. Many of our competitors obtain significant portions of their crude oil and other feedstocks from company-owned production and have extensive retail outlets. Competitors that have their own production or extensive retail outlets with brand-name recognition are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages.\nA number of the petroleum segment\u2019s competitors are integrated, multinational companies and also have materially greater financial and other resources. These competitors may have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all aspects of the refining industry. An expansion or upgrade of our competitors\u2019 facilities, price volatility, international political and economic developments and other factors are likely to continue to play an important role in refining industry economics and may add additional competitive pressure on our petroleum business. Because of the diversity, integration of operations, larger capitalization, larger and more complex refineries and greater resources of multinational oil companies, these companies may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions relating to crude oil and refined product pricing, to compete on the basis of price and to obtain crude oil in times of shortage.\nIn addition, our petroleum business competes with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of its industrial, commercial and individual customers. There are presently significant governmental incentives and consumer pressures to increase the use of alternative fuels in the United States. The more successful these alternatives become as a result of governmental incentives or regulations, technological advances, consumer demand, improved pricing or otherwise, the greater the negative impact on pricing and demand for our products and profitability.\nOur nitrogen fertilizer business is subject to intense price competition from both U.S. and foreign sources, including competitors operating in the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific region, the Caribbean, Russia and the Ukraine. Fertilizers are global commodities, with little or no product differentiation, and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and availability of the product. Increased global supply or decreases in transportation costs for foreign sources of fertilizer may put downward pressure on fertilizer prices. Furthermore, in recent years the price of nitrogen fertilizer in the United States has been substantially driven by pricing in the global fertilizer market. We compete with a number of U.S. producers and producers in other countries, including state-owned and government-subsidized entities. Some competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales, which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities. Additionally, our competitors utilizing different corporate structures may be better able to withstand lower cash flows than we can as a limited partnership. Our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are unable to expand resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions, joint ventures or partnerships. An inability to compete successfully could result in a loss of customers, which could adversely affect our sales, profitability and cash flows and, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 23\nOur businesses are geographically concentrated and are therefore subject to regional economic downturns and seasonal variations, which may affect our production levels, transportation costs and inventory and working capital levels.\nOur Refineries are both located in the southern portion of Group 3 of the PADD II region, and we primarily market refined products in a relatively limited geographic area. As a result, our petroleum business is more susceptible to regional economic conditions than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors, and any unforeseen events or circumstances that affect its operating area could also materially adversely affect its revenues and cash flows. These factors include, among other things, changes in the economy, weather conditions, demographics and population, increased supply of refined products from competitors and reductions in the supply of crude oil. In addition, if we deliver refined products to customers outside of the region, we may incur considerably higher transportation costs, resulting in lower refining margins, if any.\nOur nitrogen fertilizer segment\u2019s sales to agricultural customers are concentrated in the Great Plains and Midwest states, and nitrogen fertilizer demand is seasonal. Our quarterly results may vary significantly from one year to the next due largely to weather-related shifts in planting schedules and purchase patterns. Farmers tend to apply nitrogen fertilizer during two short application periods, one in the spring and the other in the fall. In contrast, we along with other nitrogen fertilizer producers generally produce products throughout the year. As a result, we and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during peak sales seasons. Variations in the proportion of product sold through prepaid sales contracts and variations in the terms of such contracts can increase the seasonal volatility of our cash flows and cause changes in the patterns of seasonal volatility from year-to-year. Additionally, the accumulation of inventory to be available for seasonal sales creates significant seasonal working capital and storage capacity requirements. The degree of seasonality can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors. As a consequence of this seasonality, distributions of available cash, if any, may be volatile and may vary quarterly and annually.\nBoth the petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer businesses depend on significant customers, and the loss of several significant customers may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer businesses both have a significant concentration of customers. The five largest customers of our petroleum business represented 38% of its petroleum net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. The five largest customers of the nitrogen fertilizer business also represented approximately 32% of its net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. The top petroleum customer accounts for approximately 15% of petroleum net sales and the top nitrogen fertilizer customer accounts for approximately 14% of nitrogen fertilizer net sales for this same period. Given the nature of our businesses, and consistent with industry practice, we do not have long-term minimum purchase contracts with our customers. The loss of several of these significant customers, or a significant reduction in purchase volume by several of them, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nCompliance with and changes in environmental laws and regulations, including those related to climate change, could require us to make substantial capital expenditures and adversely affect our performance.\nOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the emission or discharge of pollutants into the environment, product use and specifications and the generation, treatment, storage, transportation, disposal and remediation of solid and hazardous wastes.\nFor example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) has promulgated and implements a Renewable Fuel Standard (\u201cRFS\u201d) pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Under the RFS program, a Renewable Identification Number (\u201cRIN\u201d) is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in or imported into the U.S. The RFS program sets annual mandates for the volume of renewable fuels (such as ethanol and biodiesel) that must be blended into a refiner\u2019s transportation fuels. If a refiner of petroleum-based transportation fuels is unable to meet its renewable fuel mandate though blending, it must purchase RINs in the open market to meet its obligations under the RFS program. Our petroleum business is exposed to the volatility in the market price of RINs, which can be extreme.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 24\nViolations of applicable environmental laws and regulations or of the conditions of permits issued thereunder can result in substantial penalties, injunctive orders compelling installation of additional controls, civil and criminal sanctions, operating restrictions, injunctive relief, permit revocations and/or facility shutdowns, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our facilities and accordingly our financial performance. Capital expenditures and operating costs for current and future environmental compliance may be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our segments\u2019 results of operations, financial condition and profitability.\nIn addition, new environmental laws and regulations, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, increased governmental enforcement of laws and regulations or other developments could require us to make additional unforeseen expenditures. These laws and regulations are generally expected to impose increasingly stringent, and costly requirements over time. Various legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and GHG emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of discussion or implementation, and could affect our operations. They include proposed and enacted federal regulation and state actions to develop statewide, regional or nationwide programs designed to control and reduce GHG emissions from fixed sources, such as our refineries and fertilizer plants. Many states and regions have implemented, or are in the process of implementing, measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, but other than Kansas, we do not currently operate in states that have their own GHG reduction programs. In 2007, a group of Midwestern states, including Kansas (where the Coffeyville Refinery and Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility are located), formed the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord, which calls for the development of a cap-and-trade system to control GHG emissions and for the inventory of such emissions. However, the individual states that have signed on to the accord must adopt laws or regulations that implement the trading scheme before it becomes effective. To date, Kansas has taken no meaningful action to implement the accord, and it is unclear whether Kansas intends to do so in the future.\nAlthough it is not possible to predict the requirements of any GHG legislation that may be enacted, any laws or regulations that have been or may be adopted to restrict or reduce GHG emissions will likely require us to incur increased operating and capital costs and/or increased taxes on GHG emissions, and result in reduced demand for our fertilizer products. If we are unable to maintain sales of our products at a price that reflects such increased costs, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, any increase in the prices of our products resulting from such increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, climate change legislation and regulations may result in increased costs not only for us but also users of our fertilizer products, thereby potentially decreasing demand for our products. Further, changes in environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation relating to the end-use and application of fertilizers could cause changes in demand for our products or limit our ability market and sell products to end users. From time to time, various state legislatures have proposed bans or other limitations on fertilizer products. Decreased demand for our products may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur facilities face significant risks due to physical damage hazards, environmental liability risk exposure, and unplanned or emergency partial or total plant shutdowns resulting in business interruptions. We could incur potentially significant costs to the extent there are unforeseen events which cause property damage and a material decline in production which are not fully insured. The commercial insurance industry engaged in underwriting energy industry risk is specialized and there is finite capacity; therefore, the industry may limit or curtail coverage, may modify the coverage provided or may substantially increase premiums in the future.\nIf any of our facilities, logistics assets, or key suppliers sustains a catastrophic loss and operations are shutdown or significantly impaired, it would have a material adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, the risk exposures we have at the Coffeyville, Kansas plant complex are greater due to production facilities for petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer, distribution and storage being in relatively close proximity and potentially exposed to damage from one incident, such as resulting damages from the perils of explosion, windstorm, fire or flood. Operations at either or both of the plants could be curtailed, limited or completely shut down for an extended period of time as the result of one or more unforeseen events and circumstances, which may not be within our control, including:\n\u2022\nmajor unplanned maintenance requirements;\n\u2022\ncatastrophic events caused by mechanical breakdown, electrical injury, pressure vessel rupture, explosion, contamination, fire, or natural disasters, including floods, windstorms and other similar events;\n\u2022\nlabor supply shortages or labor difficulties that result in a work stoppage or slowdown;\n\u2022\ncessation or suspension of a plant or specific operations dictated by environmental authorities; and\n\u2022\nan event or incident involving a large clean-up, decontamination or the imposition of laws and ordinances regulating the cost and schedule of demolition or reconstruction, which can cause significant delays in restoring property to its pre-loss condition.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 25\nWe have sustained losses over the past ten-year period at our facilities, which are illustrative of the types of risks and hazards that exist. These losses or events resulted in costs assumed by us that were not fully insured due to policy retentions or applicable exclusions. We are insured under casualty, environmental, property and business interruption insurance policies. The property and business interruption policies insure real and personal property, including property located at our plants. There is potential for a common occurrence to impact both our Coffeyville Refinery and Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility in which case the insurance limits and applicable sub-limits would apply to all damages combined. These policies are subject to limits, sub-limits, retention (financial and time-based) and deductibles. The application of these and other policy conditions could materially impact insurance recoveries and potentially cause us to assume losses which could impair earnings.\nThere is finite capacity in the commercial insurance industry engaged in underwriting energy industry risk, and there are risks associated with the commercial insurance industry reducing capacity, changing the scope of insurance coverage offered, and substantially increasing premiums resulting from highly adverse loss experience or other financial circumstances. Factors that impact insurance cost and availability include, but are not limited to: industry wide losses, natural disasters, specific losses incurred by us and low or inadequate investment returns earned by the insurance industry. If the supply of commercial insurance is curtailed due to highly adverse financial results, we may not be able to continue our present limits of insurance coverage or obtain sufficient insurance capacity to adequately insure our risks for property damage or business interruption.\nWe could incur significant costs in cleaning up contamination at our refineries, terminals, fertilizer plants and off-site locations.\nOur businesses handle petroleum and hazardous substances which may result in accidental spills, discharges or other releases of petroleum or hazardous substances into the environment. Past or future spills related to any of our current or former operations, including refineries, pipelines, product terminals, and fertilizer plants, or transportation of products or hazardous substances from those facilities, may give rise to liability (including strict liability, or liability without fault, and potential cleanup responsibility) to governmental entities or private parties under federal, state or local environmental laws, as well as under common law. For example, we could be held strictly liable under CERCLA, and similar state statutes for past or future spills without regard to fault or whether our actions were in compliance with the law at the time of the spills. Pursuant to CERCLA and similar state statutes, we could be held liable for contamination associated with facilities we currently own or operate (whether such contamination occurred prior to or during our ownership), facilities we formerly owned or operated and facilities to which we transported or arranged for the transportation of wastes or byproducts containing hazardous substances for treatment, storage, or disposal.\nThe potential penalties and cleanup costs for past or future releases or spills, liability to third parties for damage to their property or exposure to hazardous substances, or the need to address newly discovered information or conditions that may require response actions could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, we may incur liability for alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances located at or released from our facilities. We may also face liability for personal injury, property damage, natural resource damage or for cleanup costs for the alleged migration of contamination or other hazardous substances from our facilities to adjacent and other nearby properties.\nFour of our facilities, including the Coffeyville Refinery, the now-closed Phillipsburg terminal (which operated as a refinery until 1991), the Wynnewood Refinery and the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility, have known environmental contamination. We have assumed the previous owner\u2019s responsibilities under certain administrative orders under RCRA related to contamination at or that originated from the Coffeyville Refinery and the Phillipsburg terminal. If significant unknown contamination is identified at or migrating from any of our facilities, the associated liability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and may not be covered by insurance.\nWe may incur future liability relating to the off-site disposal of hazardous waste from our facilities. Companies that dispose of, or arrange for the treatment, transportation or disposal of, hazardous substances at off-site locations may be held jointly and severally liable for the costs of investigation and remediation of contamination at those off-site locations, regardless of fault. We could become involved in litigation or other proceedings involving off-site waste disposal and the damages or costs in any such proceedings could be material.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 26\nNew regulations concerning the transportation, storage and handling of hazardous chemicals, risks of terrorism and the security of refineries and chemical manufacturing facilities could result in higher operating costs.\nThe costs of complying with future regulations relating to the transportation, storage and handling of hazardous chemicals and security associated with the refining and nitrogen fertilizer facilities may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Targets such as refining and chemical manufacturing facilities may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other targets in the United States. As a result, the petroleum and chemical industries have responded to the issues that arose due to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 by starting new initiatives relating to the security of petroleum and chemical industry facilities and the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the United States. Future terrorist attacks could lead to even stronger, more costly initiatives that could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to obtain or renew permits necessary for our operations, which could inhibit our ability to do business.\nOur businesses hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at our facilities. Future expansion of our operations is predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals. A decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations and on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to strict laws and regulations regarding employee and process safety, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and profitability.\nWe are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers, and the proper design, operation and maintenance of our equipment. In addition, OSHA and certain environmental regulations require that we maintain information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that we provide this information to employees and state and local governmental authorities. Failure to comply with these requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring and control of occupational exposure to regulated substances, may result in significant fines or compliance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nA significant portion of our workforce is unionized, and we are subject to the risk of labor disputes and adverse employee relations, which may disrupt our business and increase our costs.\nAs of December 31, 2018, approximately 55% and 34% of our petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer employees, respectively, were represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements. We may not be able to renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements when they expire on satisfactory terms or at all. A failure to do so may increase our costs. In addition, our existing labor agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at any of our facilities in the future, and any work stoppage could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks and other cyber incidents resulting in disruption.\nThreats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow. We depend on information technology systems. In addition, we collect, process, and retain sensitive and confidential customer information in the normal course of business. Despite the security measures we have in place and any additional measures we may implement in the future, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, could be vulnerable to security breaches, computer viruses, lost or misplaced data, programming errors, human errors, acts of vandalism or other events. Any disruption of our systems or security breach or event resulting in the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, whether by us directly or our third-party service providers, could damage our reputation, expose us to the risks of litigation and liability, disrupt our business or otherwise affect our results of operations. In addition, new laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate our costs. Any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations, including as a result of a security or privacy breach, could result in significant penalties and liabilities for us. Additionally, if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws, we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 27\nDeliberate, malicious acts, including terrorism, could damage our facilities, disrupt our operations or injure employees, contractors, customers or the public and result in liability to us.\nIntentional acts of destruction could hinder our sales or production and disrupt our supply chain. Our facilities could be damaged or destroyed, reducing our operational production capacity and requiring us to repair or replace our facilities at substantial cost. Employees, contractors and the public could suffer substantial physical injury for which we could be liable. Governmental authorities may impose security or other requirements that could make our operations more difficult or costly. The consequences of any such actions could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe acquisition and expansion strategy of our businesses involves significant risks.\nFrom time to time, we may consider pursuing acquisitions and expansion projects to continue to grow and increase profitability. However, we may not be able to consummate such acquisitions or expansions, due to intense competition for suitable acquisition targets, the potential unavailability of financial resources necessary to consummate acquisitions and expansions, difficulties in identifying suitable acquisition targets and expansion projects or in completing any transactions identified on sufficiently favorable terms and the failure to obtain requisite regulatory or other governmental approvals. In addition, any future acquisitions and expansions may entail significant transaction costs and risks associated with entry into new markets and lines of business, including but not limited to new regulatory obligations and risks.\nEven when acquisitions are completed, integration of acquired entities can involve significant difficulties, such as\n\u2022\nUnforeseen difficulties in the integration of the acquired operations and disruption of the ongoing operations of our business;\n\u2022\nFailure to achieve cost savings or other financial or operating objectives contributing to the accretive nature of an acquisition;\n\u2022\nStrain on the operational and managerial controls and procedures and the need to modify systems or to add management resources;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in the integration and retention of customers or personnel and the integration and effective deployment of operations or technologies;\n\u2022\nAssumption of unknown material liabilities or regulatory non-compliance issues;\n\u2022\nAmortization of acquired assets, which would reduce future reported earnings;\n\u2022\nPossible adverse short-term effects on our cash flows or operating results; and\n\u2022\nDiversion of management\u2019s attention from the ongoing operations of our business.\nIn addition, in connection with any potential acquisition or expansion project specific to CVR Partners (our nitrogen fertilizer segment), we will need to consider whether a business we intend to acquire or expansion project we intend to pursue could affect CVR Partners\u2019 tax treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. If CVR Partners is otherwise unable to conclude that the activities of the business being acquired or the expansion project would not affect its treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, it may elect to seek a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d). Seeking such a ruling could be costly or, in the case of competitive acquisitions, place the business in a competitive disadvantage compared to other potential acquirers who do not seek such a ruling. If CVR Partners is otherwise unable to conclude that an activity would not affect its treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, and are unable or unwilling to obtain an IRS ruling, we may choose to acquire such business or develop such expansion project in a corporate subsidiary of CVR Partners, which would subject the income related to such activity to entity-level taxation, which would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to CVR Partners\u2019 common unitholders and could likely cause a substantial reduction in the value of its common units.\nFailure to manage these acquisition and expansion growth risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our joint ventures involve similar risks. There can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate any acquisitions or expansions, successfully integrate acquired entities, or generate positive cash flow at any acquired company or expansion project.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 28\nRisks Related to the Petroleum Segment\nIf our petroleum business is required to obtain its crude oil supply without the benefit of a crude oil supply agreement, its exposure to the risks associated with volatile crude oil prices may increase and its liquidity may be reduced.\nOur petroleum business obtains substantially all of its crude oil supply for the Coffeyville Refinery, other than the crude oil it gathers, through the Vitol Agreement. The Vitol Agreement also includes the provision of crude oil intermediation services to the Wynnewood Refinery. The agreement, which currently extends through December 31, 2019, minimizes the amount of in-transit inventory and mitigates crude oil pricing risk by ensuring pricing takes place close to the time the crude oil is refined and the yielded products are sold. If we were required to obtain our crude oil supply without the benefit of a supply intermediation agreement, our petroleum business\u2019 exposure to crude oil pricing risk may increase, despite any hedging activity in which it may engage, and its liquidity could be negatively impacted due to increased inventory, potential need to post letters of credit and negative impacts of market volatility. There is no assurance that we will be able to renew or extend the Vitol Agreement beyond December 31, 2019.\nDisruption of the petroleum segment\u2019s ability to obtain an adequate supply of crude oil could reduce its liquidity and increase its costs.\nIn addition to the crude oil gathered and purchased primarily in in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, our petroleum business also purchases domestic and international crude oil under the Vitol Agreement. In 2018, the Coffeyville Refinery purchased approximately 75,000 to 80,000 bpd of such crude oil, while the Wynnewood Refinery purchased approximately 5,000 to 10,000 bpd of such crude oil. The Wynnewood Refinery has historically acquired most of its crude oil from our gathering operations in Oklahoma and Texas, with smaller amounts purchased from other regions. In 2018, the Coffeyville Refinery obtained approximately 6% of its non-gathered crude oil from Canada. The actual amount of Canadian crude oil we purchase is dependent on market conditions and will vary from year to year. Disruption of production for any reason could have a material impact on the petroleum segment. In the event that one or more of its traditional suppliers becomes unavailable, we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of crude oil, or we may only be able to obtain crude oil at unfavorable prices. As a result, we may experience a reduction in liquidity and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIf our access to the pipelines on which the petroleum segment relies for the supply of its crude oil and the distribution of its products is interrupted, its inventory and costs may increase and it may be unable to efficiently distribute its products.\nIf one of the pipelines on which either of the Refineries relies for supply of crude oil becomes inoperative, the petroleum segment would be required to obtain crude oil through alternative pipelines or from additional tanker trucks, which could increase its costs and result in lower production levels and profitability. Similarly, if a major refined fuels pipeline becomes inoperative, we would be required to keep refined fuels in inventory or supply refined fuels to its customers through an alternative pipeline or by additional tanker trucks, which could increase the petroleum segment\u2019s costs and result in a decline in profitability.\nCompliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Renewable Fuel Standard could adversely affect our performance.\nWe are exposed to the volatility in the market price of RINs, which can be extreme. We cannot predict the future prices of RINs. RIN prices are dependent upon a variety of factors, including EPA regulations, the availability of RINs for purchase, and levels of transportation fuels produced, the mix of the petroleum business\u2019 petroleum products, as well as the fuel blending performed at the Refineries and downstream terminals, all of which can vary significantly from period to period. However, the costs to obtain the necessary number of RINs and waiver credits could be material, if the price for RINs continues to increase. Additionally, because the petroleum business does not produce renewable fuels, increasing the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into its products displaces an increasing volume of the Refineries' product pool, potentially resulting in lower earnings and materially adversely affecting the petroleum business\u2019 cash flows. If the demand for the petroleum business\u2019 transportation fuel decreases as a result of the use of increasing volumes of renewable fuels, increased fuel economy as a result of new EPA fuel economy standards, or other factors, the impact on its business could be material. If sufficient RINs are unavailable for purchase, if the petroleum business has to pay a significantly higher price for RINs or if the petroleum business is otherwise unable to meet the EPA's RFS mandates, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recognized expense totaling $60 million, $249 million and $206 million, respectively, to comply with RFS. Based upon recent market prices of RINs and current estimates related to the other variable factors, our estimated cost to comply with RFS is $80 to $90 million for 2019.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 29\nChanges in the petroleum business\u2019 credit profile may affect its relationship with its suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to operate the Refineries at full capacity.\nChanges in the petroleum business\u2019 credit profile may affect the way crude oil suppliers view our ability to make payments and may induce them to shorten the payment terms for purchases or require it to post security prior to payment. Given the large dollar amounts and volume of our crude oil and other feedstock purchases, a burdensome change in payment terms may have a material adverse effect on liquidity and our ability to make payments to suppliers. This, in turn, could cause us to be unable to operate the Refineries at full capacity. A failure to operate at full capacity could adversely affect our profitability and cash flows.\nThe petroleum business\u2019 commodity derivative contracts may limit potential gains, exacerbate potential losses and involve other risks.\nWe may enter into commodity derivatives contracts to mitigate crack spread risk with respect to a portion of expected refined products production. However, hedging arrangements, if we are able to procure them, may fail to fully achieve this objective for a variety of reasons, including its failure to have adequate hedging contracts, if any, in effect at any particular time and the failure of hedging arrangements to produce the anticipated results. Moreover, such transactions may limit our ability to benefit from favorable changes in margins. In addition, our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:\n\u2022\nthe volumes of its actual use of crude oil or production of the applicable refined products is less than the volumes subject to the hedging arrangement;\n\u2022\naccidents, interruptions in transportation, inclement weather or other events cause unscheduled shutdowns or otherwise adversely affect a refinery or suppliers or customers;\n\u2022\nthe counterparties to its futures contracts fail to perform under the contracts; or\n\u2022\na sudden, unexpected event materially impacts the commodity or crack spread subject to the hedging arrangement.\nAs a result, the effectiveness of our risk mitigation strategy could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\") is comprehensive financial reform legislation that, among other things, establishes comprehensive federal oversight and regulation of over-the-counter derivatives and many of the entities that participate in that market. While some of the rules and regulations under Dodd-Frank Act have been finalized, others have not. As a result, the final form and timing of the implementation of the new regulatory regime affecting commodity derivatives remains uncertain. If we reduces our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and any new rules and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to satisfy its debt obligations or plan for and fund capital expenditures. Increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices. If the Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations result in lower commodity prices, our petroleum business\u2019 revenues could be adversely affected. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and therefore could have an adverse effect on our ability to satisfy debt obligations.\nAdditionally, since we do not apply hedge accounting to its commodity derivative contracts, gains and losses are charged to its earnings based on the increase or decrease in the market value of derivative positions. Such gains and losses are reflected in its income statement in periods that differ from when the underlying hedged items (i.e., gross margins) are reflected in our income statement. Such derivative gains or losses in earnings may produce significant period-to-period earnings volatility that is not necessarily reflective of our petroleum business\u2019 operational performance.\nWe must make substantial capital expenditures on the Refineries and other facilities to maintain their reliability and efficiency. If we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and/or in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in project economics deteriorate, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur Refineries have been in operation for many years. Equipment, even if properly maintained, may require significant capital expenditures and expenses to keep operating at optimum efficiency. These refineries generally require facility turnaround every four to five years. Delays or cost increases related to the engineering, procurement and construction of new facilities, or improvements and repairs to existing facilities and equipment, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors in the marketplace, many of which are beyond our control, including:\nDecember 31, 2018 | 30\n\u2022\ndenial or delay in obtaining regulatory approvals and/or permits;\n\u2022\nunplanned increases in the cost of equipment, materials or labor;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in transportation of equipment and materials;\n\u2022\nsevere adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors and suppliers;\n\u2022\nshortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages;\n\u2022\nmarket-related increases in a project\u2019s debt or equity financing costs; and/or\n\u2022\nnon-performance or force majeure by, or disputes with, the petroleum segment\u2019s vendors, suppliers, contractors or sub-contractors.\nAny one or more of these occurrences noted above could have a significant impact on our petroleum business. If we are unable to make up for the delays or to recover the related costs, or if market conditions change, we could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nMore stringent trucking regulations may increase our petroleum business\u2019 costs and negatively impact results of operations.\nIn connection with the trucking operations conducted by our crude gathering division, our petroleum business operates as a motor carrier and therefore is subject to regulation by federal and various state agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations and regulatory safety, and hazardous materials labeling, placarding and marking. There are additional regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry, including testing and specification of equipment and product handling requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services. Some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent fuel-economy environmental regulations, changes in the hours of service regulations that govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period, onboard black box recorder or electronic logging devices or limits on vehicle weight and size.\nTo a large degree, intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to state safety regulations that mirror federal regulations. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations. Furthermore, from time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, such as proposals to increase federal, state or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, which may increase our costs or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any increase in such taxes will be enacted or the extent to which they will apply to our petroleum business and its operations.\nRisks Related to the Nitrogen Fertilizer Segment\nAny decline in U.S. agricultural production or limitations on the use of nitrogen fertilizer for agricultural purposes could have a material adverse effect on the sales of nitrogen fertilizer, and on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nConditions in the U.S. agricultural industry significantly impact our operating results. The U.S. agricultural industry can be affected by a number of factors, including weather patterns and field conditions, current and projected grain inventories and prices, domestic and international population changes, demand for U.S. agricultural products and U.S. and foreign policies regarding trade in agricultural products. For example, a major factor underlying the solid level of demand for nitrogen-based fertilizer products we produce is the use of corn for the production of ethanol in the U.S. Changes in governmental incentives for ethanol production could affect future ethanol demand and production.\nState and federal governmental policies, including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs, as well as the prices of fertilizer products, may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted, the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications. Developments in crop technology, such as nitrogen fixation (the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate), could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for nitrogen fertilizer. In addition, from time to time various state legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment. Unfavorable state and federal governmental policies could negatively affect nitrogen fertilizer prices and therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 31\nEthanol production in the United States is highly dependent upon a myriad of federal statutes and regulations, and is made significantly more competitive by various federal and state incentives and mandated usage of renewable fuels pursuant to EPA\u2019s RFS. To date, the RFS has been satisfied primarily with corn-based fuel ethanol blended into gasoline. However, a number of factors, including the continuing \u201cfood versus fuel\u201d debate and studies showing that expanded ethanol usage may increase the level of greenhouse gases in the environment as well as be unsuitable for small engine use, have resulted in calls to reduce subsidies for ethanol, allow increased ethanol imports and to repeal or waive (in whole or in part) the current RFS. Changes within the RFS program also could affect future ethanol demand and production. Further, while most ethanol is currently produced from corn and other raw grains, such as milo or sorghum, the RFS requires that a portion of the overall RFS renewable fuel mandate comes from advanced biofuels, including cellulose-based biomass, such as agricultural waste, forest residue, and municipal solid waste. In addition, there is a continuing trend to encourage the use of products other than corn and raw grains for ethanol production. The repeal of, or reduction in the benefits to ethanol producers under, ethanol incentive programs, an increase in ethanol imports, a substantial decrease in future renewable volume obligations under the RFS program, or a significant increase in the use of products other than corn and raw grains for ethanol production could affect the demand for corn-based ethanol and result in a decrease in planted corn acreage and in the demand for nitrogen fertilizer products and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur Coffeyville Facility may be adversely affected by the supply and price levels of pet coke. Failure by CVR Energy\u2019s Coffeyville refinery to continue to supply us with pet coke and the availability of third-party pet coke at higher prices could negatively impact our results of operations.\nUnlike our competitors, whose primary costs are related to the purchase of natural gas and whose costs are therefore largely variable, our Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility uses a pet coke gasification process to produce nitrogen fertilizer. Our profitability is directly affected by the price and availability of pet coke obtained from our Coffeyville Refinery pursuant to a long-term agreement. Our Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility has obtained the majority of its pet coke from our Coffeyville Refinery over the past five years. However, should our Coffeyville Refinery fail to perform in accordance with the existing agreement, we would need to purchase pet coke from third parties on the open market, which could negatively impact our results of operations to the extent third-party pet coke is unavailable or available only at higher prices. Currently, we purchase 100% of the pet coke our Coffeyville Refinery produces. However, we are still required to procure additional pet coke from third parties to maintain our production rates. Accordingly, we are party to a pet coke supply agreement with a third-party refinery to provide a significant amount of pet coke at a fixed price. The term of this agreement ends in December 2019.\nThe market for natural gas has been volatile, and fluctuations in natural gas prices could affect our competitive position.\nOur Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility uses a pet coke gasification process to produce nitrogen fertilizer. When compared to our Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility, low natural gas prices benefit our competitors that rely on natural gas as their primary feedstock and disproportionately impact our operations by making us less competitive with natural gas-based nitrogen fertilizer manufacturers. Continued low natural gas prices could result in nitrogen fertilizer pricing drops and impair the ability of the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility to compete with other nitrogen fertilizer producers who use natural gas as their primary feedstock, and therefore have a material adverse impact on the nitrogen fertilizer segment\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions.\nThe East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility uses natural gas as its primary feedstock, and as such, the profitability of operating the East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility is significantly dependent on the cost of natural gas. An increase in natural gas prices could make it less competitive with producers who do not use natural gas as their primary feedstock. In addition, an increase in natural gas prices in the United States relative to prices of natural gas paid by foreign nitrogen fertilizer producers may negatively affect our competitive position in the corn belt, and such changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe expect to purchase a portion of our natural gas for use in the East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility on the spot market. As a result, we remain susceptible to fluctuations in the price of natural gas in general and in local markets in particular. We may use short-term, fixed supply, fixed price forward purchase contracts to lock in pricing for a portion of its natural gas requirement, but we may not be able to enter into such agreements on acceptable terms or at all. Without forward purchase contracts for the supply of natural gas, we would need to purchase natural gas on the spot market, which would impair its ability to hedge exposure to risk from fluctuations in natural gas prices. If we enter into forward purchase contracts for natural gas, and natural gas prices decrease, then its cost of sales could be higher than it would have been in the absence of the forward purchase contracts.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 32\nAny interruption in the supply of natural gas to our East Dubuque Facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility depends on the availability of natural gas. We have an agreement with Nicor pursuant to which we access natural gas from the ANR Pipeline Company and Northern Natural Gas pipelines. Our access to satisfactory supplies of natural gas through Nicor could be disrupted due to a number of causes, including volume limitations under the agreement, pipeline malfunctions, service interruptions, mechanical failures or other reasons. The agreement extends through October 31, 2019. Upon expiration of the agreement, we may be unable to extend the service under the terms of the existing agreement or renew the agreement on satisfactory terms, or at all. Any disruption in the supply of natural gas to our East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility could restrict our ability to continue to make products at the facility. In the event we need to obtain natural gas from another source, we may need to build a new connection from that source to the East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility and negotiate related easement rights, which would be costly, disruptive and/or may be unfeasible. As a result, any interruption in the supply of natural gas through Nicor could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf licensed technology were no longer available, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe have licensed, and may in the future license, a combination of patent, trade secret and other intellectual property rights of third parties for use in our plant operation. In particular, the gasification process used at the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility to convert pet coke to high purity hydrogen for subsequent conversion to ammonia is licensed from a third party. The license, which is fully paid, grants us perpetual rights to use the pet coke gasification process on specified terms and conditions and is integral to the operations of the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility. If this license or any other license agreement on which our operations rely were to be terminated, licenses to alternative technology may not be available, or may only be available on terms that are not commercially reasonable or acceptable. In addition, any substitution of new technology for currently-licensed technology may require substantial changes to manufacturing processes or equipment and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAdditionally, we may face claims of infringement that could interfere with our ability to use technology that is material to our plant operations. Any litigation of this type related to third-party intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs and diversions of resources, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In the event a claim of infringement against us is successful, we may be required to pay royalties or license fees for past or continued use of the infringing technology, or we may be prohibited from using the infringing technology altogether. If we are prohibited from using any technology as a result of such a claim, we may not be able to obtain licenses to alternative technology adequate to substitute for the technology we can no longer use, or licenses for such alternative technology may only be available on terms that are not commercially reasonable or acceptable. In addition, any substitution of new technology for currently licensed technology may require us to make substantial changes to its manufacturing processes or equipment or to our products, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur operations are dependent on third-party suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOperations of our Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility depend in large part on the performance of third-party suppliers, and the operations of the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility could be adversely affected if the operation of the third-party air separation plant located adjacent to it were disrupted. Additionally, this air separation plant in the past has experienced numerous short-term interruptions, causing interruptions in our gasifier operations. With respect to electricity, we are party to an electric services agreement with a third-party supplier, which allows for an option for us to extend the term of such agreement through June 30, 2024.\nOur East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility operations also depend in large part on the performance of third-party suppliers, including for the purchase of electricity. We entered into a utility service agreement, which terminates on May 31, 2019 and will continue year-to-year thereafter unless either party provides 12-month advance written notice of termination.\nShould any of our other third-party suppliers fail to perform in accordance with existing contractual arrangements, or should we otherwise lose the service of any third-party suppliers, our operations (or a portion thereof) could be forced to halt. Alternative sources of supply could be difficult to obtain. Any shutdown of our operations (or a portion thereof), even for a limited period, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 33\nWe rely on third-party providers of transportation services and equipment, which subjects it to risks and uncertainties beyond its control that may have a material adverse effect on the nitrogen fertilizer segment\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and ability to make distributions.\nOur business relies on railroad and trucking companies to ship finished products to customers of the Coffeyville Fertilizer Facility. We also lease railcars from railcar owners to ship its finished products. Additionally, although customers of the East Dubuque Fertilizer Facility generally pick up products at the facility, the facility occasionally relies on barge, truck and railroad companies to ship products to customers. These transportation operations, equipment and services are subject to various hazards, including extreme weather conditions, work stoppages, delays, spills, derailments and other accidents and other operating hazards. Further, the limited number of towing companies and barges available for ammonia transport may also impact the availability of transportation for our nitrogen fertilizer segment\u2019s products. These transportation operations, equipment and services are also subject to environmental, safety and other regulatory oversight. Due to concerns related to terrorism or accidents, local, state and federal governments could implement new regulations affecting the transportation of our finished products. In addition, new regulations could be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship its finished products.\nAny delay in our ability to ship its finished products as a result of these transportation companies\u2019 failure to operate properly, the implementation of new and more stringent regulatory requirements affecting transportation operations or equipment, or significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions.\nAmmonia can be very volatile and extremely hazardous. Any liability for accidents involving ammonia or other products we produce or transport that cause severe damage to property or injury to the environment and human health could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions. In addition, the costs of transporting ammonia could increase significantly in the future.\nOur business manufactures, processes, stores, handles, distributes and transports ammonia, which can be very volatile and extremely hazardous. Major accidents or releases involving ammonia could cause severe damage or injury to property, the environment and human health, as well as a possible disruption of supplies and markets. Such an event could result in civil lawsuits, fines, penalties and regulatory enforcement proceedings, all of which could lead to significant liabilities. Any damage or injury to persons, equipment or property or other disruption of our ability to produce or distribute products could result in a significant decrease in operating revenues and significant additional cost to replace or repair and insure our assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions. Our facilities periodically experience minor releases of ammonia related to leaks from its equipment. Similar events may occur in the future.\nIn addition, we may incur significant losses or costs relating to the operation of railcars used for the purpose of carrying various products, including ammonia. Due to the dangerous and potentially hazardous nature of the cargo, in particular ammonia, a railcar accident may result in fires, explosions and releases of material which could lead to sudden, severe damage or injury to property, the environment and human health. In the event of contamination, under environmental law we may be held responsible even if it is not at fault and we complied with the laws and regulations in effect at the time of the accident. Litigation arising from accidents involving ammonia and other products we produce or transport may result in us being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 34\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nInternally generated cash flows and other sources of liquidity may not be adequate for the capital needs of our businesses.\nOur businesses are capital intensive, and working capital needs may vary significantly over relatively short periods of time. For instance, crude oil price volatility can significantly impact working capital on a week-to-week and month-to-month basis. If we cannot generate adequate cash flow or otherwise secure sufficient liquidity to meet our working capital needs or support our short-term and long-term capital requirements, we may be unable to meet our debt obligations, pursue our business strategies or comply with certain environmental standards, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nInstability and volatility in the capital, credit and commodity markets in the global economy could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted by difficult conditions and volatility in the capital, credit and commodities markets and in the global economy. For example:\n\u2022\nAlthough we believe the petroleum segment has sufficient liquidity under its Amended and Restated ABL credit facility to operate Refineries, and that the nitrogen fertilizer segment has sufficient liquidity under its ABL credit facility to run the nitrogen fertilizer segment, under extreme market conditions there can be no assurance that such funds would be available or sufficient, and in such a case, we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all.\n\u2022\nMarket volatility could exert downward pressure on the price of CVR Partners\u2019 common units, which may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital and thereby limit its ability to grow, which could in turn cause the CVR Energy stock and/or CVR Partners\u2019 unit price to drop.\n\u2022\nThe petroleum segment\u2019s and nitrogen fertilizer business\u2019 credit facilities contain various covenants that must be complied with, and if either segment is not in compliance, there can be no assurance that either segment would be able to successfully amend the agreement in the future. Further, any such amendment may be expensive. In addition, any new credit facility the petroleum segment or nitrogen fertilizer segment may enter into may require each to agree to additional covenants.\n\u2022\nMarket conditions could result in significant customers experiencing financial difficulties. We are exposed to the credit risk of our customers, and their failure to meet their financial obligations when due because of bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons could result in decreased sales and earnings for us.\nCVR Refining and CVR Partners\u2019 level of indebtedness may affect our ability to operate their businesses, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have incurred indebtedness at the petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer segments and we may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. If new indebtedness is added to current indebtedness, the risks described below could increase. Their level of indebtedness could have important consequences, such as:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions or other purposes;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to utilize a significant portion of cash flows to service indebtedness, thereby reducing available cash and the ability to make distributions to us and public common unitholders of CVR Partners;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service debt;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to compete with other companies who are not as highly leveraged, as we may be less capable of responding to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to make certain payments on debt that is subordinated or secured on a junior basis;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or investments, introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022\nrestricting the way in which we conduct business because of financial and operating covenants in the agreements governing existing and future indebtedness, including, in the case of certain indebtedness of subsidiaries, certain covenants that restrict the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to enter into certain transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries;\nDecember 31, 2018 | 35\n\u2022\nexposing us to potential events of default (if not cured or waived) under financial and operating covenants contained in their or their respective subsidiaries\u2019 debt instruments that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in pricing of products; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to react to changing market conditions in their respective industries and in respective customers\u2019 industries.\nIn addition to debt service obligations, our petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer operations require substantial capital investments on a continuing basis. The ability to make scheduled debt payments, to refinance obligations with respect to existing indebtedness and to fund capital and non-capital expenditures necessary to maintain the condition of operating assets, properties and systems software, as well as to provide capacity for business growth, depends on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, competitive, legal and other factors.\nIn addition, our petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer segments are and will be subject to covenants contained in agreements governing their present and future indebtedness. These covenants include, and will likely include, restrictions on certain payments (including restrictions on CVR Partners to make distributions to unitholders), the granting of liens, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, dividend restrictions affecting subsidiaries, asset sales, transactions with affiliates and mergers and consolidations. Any failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under current credit agreements or debt instruments or future credit agreements.\nOur operating segments may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service existing indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy debt obligations that may not be successful.\nThe petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer segments\u2019 ability to satisfy existing debt obligations will depend upon, among other things:\n\u2022\nfuture financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control; and\n\u2022\nfuture ability to obtain other financing.\nWe cannot offer any assurance that our businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that our petroleum business will be able to draw under its Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility or that the nitrogen fertilizer business will be able to draw under its ABL credit facility or otherwise, or from other sources of financing, in an amount sufficient to fund respective liquidity needs.\nIf cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service existing indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance existing indebtedness or seek bankruptcy protection. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit the meeting of scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition, including that of our operating segments, at such time. Any refinancing of existing debt could be at higher interest rates and may require compliance with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict business operations, and the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, in the absence of adequate cash flows or capital resources, our businesses could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations, or, in the case of CVR Partners, sell equity, and/or negotiate with lenders to restructure the applicable debt in order to meet their debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value or at all. Market or business conditions may limit our ability to avail themselves of some or all of these options. Furthermore, any proceeds that they realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet existing debt service obligations when due.\nThe borrowings under CVR Refining\u2019s Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility and CVR Partners\u2019 ABL credit facility bear interest at variable rates and other debt we or they incur could likewise be variable-rate debt. If market interest rates increase, variable-rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect distributions to us. We may enter into agreements limiting exposure to higher interest rates, but any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 36\nOur petroleum and nitrogen fertilizer debt agreements contain restrictions that limit flexibility in operating the respective businesses and, in the case of CVR Partners, limit the ability to make distributions to unitholders.\nThe CVR Refining and CVR Partners\u2019 debt facilities and instruments contain, and any instruments governing future indebtedness would likely contain, a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on the ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred units;\n\u2022\npay distributions in respect of common units or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake certain payments on debt that is subordinated or secured on a junior basis;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on certain assets;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all assets;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\ndesignate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nAny of these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions and could otherwise restrict operating activities. Any failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under existing debt facilities and instruments. Upon a default, unless waived, the lenders under such debt facilities and instruments would have all remedies available to a secured lender, and could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans, institute foreclosure proceedings against assets, and force bankruptcy or liquidation, subject to any applicable intercreditor agreements. In addition, a default under existing debt facilities and instruments would trigger a cross default under other agreements and could trigger a cross default under the agreements governing future indebtedness. Our operating segments\u2019 results may not be sufficient to service existing indebtedness or to fund other expenditures and we may not be able to obtain financing to meet these requirements.\nDespite existing indebtedness, we may still be able to incur significantly more debt, including secured indebtedness. This could intensify the risks described above.\nWe may be able to incur substantially more debt in the future, including secured indebtedness. Although existing credit facilities contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Also, these restrictions may not prevent incurring new obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. To the extent such new debt or new obligations are added to existing indebtedness, the risks described above could substantially increase.\nWe are authorized to issue up to a total of 350 million shares of our common stock and 50 million shares of preferred stock, potentially diluting equity ownership of current holders and the share price of our common stock.\nWe believe that it is necessary to maintain a sufficient number of available authorized shares of our common stock and preferred stock to provide us with the flexibility to issue common stock or preferred stock for business purposes that may arise as deemed advisable by our board of directors. These purposes could include, among other things, (i) future stock dividends or stock splits, which may increase the liquidity of our shares; (ii) the sale of stock to obtain additional capital or to acquire other companies or businesses, which could enhance our growth strategy or allow us to reduce debt if needed; (iii) for use in additional stock incentive programs and (iv) for other bona fide purposes. Our board of directors may authorize us to issue the available authorized shares of common stock or preferred stock without notice to, or further action by, our stockholders, unless stockholder approval is required by law or the rules of the NYSE. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock may significantly dilute the equity ownership of the current holders of our common stock.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 37\nOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock is subject to market conditions and numerous other factors.\nIn January 2013, our board of directors adopted a quarterly dividend policy. We began paying regular quarterly dividends in the second quarter of 2013. Dividends are subject to change at the discretion of the board of directors and may change from quarter to quarter. Our ability to continue paying dividends is subject to our ability to continue to generate sufficient cash flow from our operating segments, and the amount of dividends we are able to pay each year may vary, possibly substantially, based on market conditions, crack spreads, our capital expenditure and other business needs, covenants contained in any debt agreements we may enter into in the future, covenants contained in existing debt agreements, and the amount of distributions we receive from CVR Partners. We may not be able to continue paying dividends at the rate we currently pay dividends, or at all. If the amount of our dividends decreases, the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected as a result.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure\nWe are a holding company and depend upon our subsidiaries for our cash flow.\nAs of the period ending December 31, 2018, our two principal subsidiaries are CVR Refining (our petroleum segment) and CVR Partners (our nitrogen fertilizer segment), a publicly traded partnership, with a portion of its common units traded on the NYSE. We are a holding company, and these subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets. Consequently, our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations or to pay dividends or make other distributions in the future will depend upon the cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by our subsidiaries to us in the form of distributions. The ability of CVR Partners to make any payments to us will depend on, among other things, their earnings, the terms of existing indebtedness (including the terms of any debt facilities and instruments), tax considerations and legal restrictions. In particular, future debt facilities and instruments incurred at our subsidiaries may impose significant limitations on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow or, in the case of CVR Partners, make distributions to us and consequently our ability to issue dividends to our stockholders.\nMr. Carl C. Icahn exerts significant influence over the Company, and his interests may conflict with the interests of the Company\u2019s other stockholders.\nMr. Carl C. Icahn indirectly controls approximately 71% of the voting power of our common stock and, by virtue of such stock ownership, is able to control or exert substantial influence over the Company, including:\n\u2022\nthe election and appointment of directors;\n\u2022\nbusiness strategy and policies;\n\u2022\nmergers or other business combinations;\n\u2022\nacquisition or disposition of assets;\n\u2022\nfuture issuances of common stock, common units or other securities;\n\u2022\nincurrence of debt or obtaining other sources of financing; and\n\u2022\nthe payment of dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock and distributions on the common units of CVR Partners.\nThe existence of a controlling stockholder may have the effect of making it difficult for, or may discourage or delay, a third party from seeking to acquire a majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock, which may adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nMr. Icahn\u2019s interests may not always be consistent with the Company\u2019s interests or with the interests of the Company\u2019s other stockholders. Mr. Icahn and entities controlled by him may also pursue acquisitions or business opportunities in industries in which we compete, and there is no requirement that any additional business opportunities be presented to us. We also have and may in the future enter into transactions to purchase goods or services with affiliates of Mr. Icahn. To the extent that conflicts of interest may arise between the Company and Mr. Icahn and his affiliates, those conflicts may be resolved in a manner adverse to the Company or its other stockholders.\nIn addition, if Mr. Icahn were to sell, or otherwise transfer, some or all of his interests in us to an unrelated party or group, a change of control could be deemed to have occurred under the terms of the indentures governing CVR Refining\u2019s 6.5% senior notes, which would require it to offer to repurchase all outstanding notes at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued interest to the date of repurchase, and an event of default could be deemed to have occurred under CVR Refining\u2019s Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility, which would allow lenders to accelerate indebtedness owed to them. However, it is possible that\nDecember 31, 2018 | 38\nwe will not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control to make the required repurchase of notes or repay amounts outstanding under CVR Refining\u2019s Amended and Restated ABL Credit Facility, if any.\nOur stock price may decline due to sales of shares by Mr. Carl C. Icahn.\nSales of substantial amounts of the Company\u2019s common stock, or the perception that these sales may occur, may adversely affect the price of the Company\u2019s common stock and impede its ability to raise capital through the issuance of equity securities in the future. Mr. Icahn could elect in the future to request that the Company file a registration statement to him to sell shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. If Mr. Icahn were to sell a large number of shares into the public markets, Mr. Icahn could cause the price of the Company\u2019s common stock to decline.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE rules and, as a result, qualify for, and are relying on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nA company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, a group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE rules and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements of the NYSE, including:\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a majority of our board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we have a nominating/corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors.\nWe are relying on all of these exemptions as a controlled company. Accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE. In addition, CVR Partners is relying on exemptions from the same NYSE corporate governance requirements described above.\nWe have various mechanisms in place to discourage takeover attempts, which may reduce or eliminate our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares for a premium in a change of control transaction.\nVarious provisions of our amended certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws and of Delaware corporate law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control or takeover attempt of our Company by a third party that our management and board of directors determines is not in the best interest of our Company and its stockholders. Public stockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have the opportunity to do so. These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change of control or change in our management and board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\npreferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or to discourage a third party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding voting stock;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of stockholders to act by written consent in lieu of a stockholders\u2019 meeting; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by our stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nCompliance with and changes in the tax laws could adversely affect our performance.\nWe are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including United States and state income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise and withholding taxes. New tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 39\nRisks Related to Our Ownership in CVR Partners\nCVR Partners\u2019 policy is to distribute an amount equal to the \u201cavailable cash\u201d it generates each quarter, which could limit its ability to grow and make acquisitions.\nThe current policy of the board of directors of CVR Partners\u2019 general partner, which is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of CVR Energy, is to distribute an amount equal to the available cash generated by CVR Partners each quarter to its unitholders. As a result of its cash distribution policy, CVR Partners will rely primarily upon external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. As such, to the extent it is unable to finance growth externally, CVR Partners\u2019 cash distribution policy may significantly impair its ability to grow. CVR Partners may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to enable the payment of distributions to common unitholders. Furthermore, its partnership agreement does not require it to pay distributions on a quarterly basis or otherwise. As such, the board of directors of its general partner may modify or revoke its cash distribution policy at any time at its discretion, including in such a manner that would result in an elimination of cash distributions regardless of the amount of available cash our business generates.\nIn addition, because of its distribution policy, CVR Partners\u2019 growth, if any, may not be as robust as that of businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations. To the extent CVR Partners issues additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures or as in-kind distributions, current unitholders will experience dilution and the payment of distributions on those additional units will decrease the amount CVR Partners distributes in respect of its outstanding units. Under CVR Partners\u2019 partnership agreement, it is authorized to issue an unlimited number of additional interests without a vote of the common unitholders. The issuance by CVR Partners of additional common units or other equity interests of equal or senior rank will reduce the proportionate ownership interest of common unitholders immediately prior to the issuance. As a result of the issuance of common units, the following may occur:\n\u2022\nthe amount of cash distributions on each common unit may decrease;\n\u2022\nthe ratio of CVR Partners\u2019 taxable income to distributions may increase;\n\u2022\nthe relative voting strength of each previously outstanding common unit will be diminished; and\n\u2022\nthe market price of the common units may decline.\nIn addition, CVR Partners\u2019 partnership agreement does not prohibit the issuance by its subsidiaries of equity interests, which may effectively rank senior to the common units. The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt to finance its growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which, in turn, would reduce the available cash it has to distribute to unitholders.\nIf CVR Partners were to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or if it becomes subject to entity-level taxation for state tax purposes, its cash available for distribution to its common unitholders, including to us, would be substantially reduced, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of its common units, including the common units held by us.\nThe anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in common units of CVR Partners depends largely on it being treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Despite the fact that CVR Partners is organized as a limited partnership under Delaware law, it would be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless it satisfies a \u201cqualifying income\u201d requirement. CVR Partners may not find it possible to meet this qualifying income requirement, or may inadvertently fail to meet this qualifying income requirement.\nCurrent law may change, causing CVR Partners to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subjecting CVR Partners to entity-level taxation.\nIf CVR Partners were to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would pay U.S. federal income tax on all of its taxable income at the corporate tax rate. Distributions to its common unitholders (including us) would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses or deductions would flow through to such common unitholders. Because a tax would be imposed upon CVR Partners as a corporation, its cash available for distribution to common unitholders would be substantially reduced. Therefore, treatment of CVR Partners as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to its common unitholders (including us), likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of such common units.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 40\nWe may have liability to repay distributions that are wrongfully distributed to us.\nUnder certain circumstances, we may, as a holder of common units in CVR Partners, have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to us. Under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, a partnership may not make distributions to its unitholders if the distribution would cause its liabilities to exceed the fair value of its assets. Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of an impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to the company for the distribution amount.\nPublic investors own approximately 66% of the nitrogen fertilizer segment through CVR Partners. Although we own the general partner of the CVR Partners, the general partner owes a duty of good faith to public unitholders, which could cause them to manage their respective businesses differently than if there were no public unitholders.\nPublic investors own approximately 66% of CVR Partners\u2019 common units. We are not entitled to receive all of the cash generated by CVR Partners or freely transfer money to finance operations at the petroleum segment. Furthermore, although we own the general partner of CVR Partners, the general partner is subject to certain fiduciary duties, which may require the general partner to manage its business in a way that may differ from our best interests.\nThe general partner of CVR Partners has limited its liability, replaced default fiduciary duties and restricted the remedies available to common unitholders, including us, for actions that, without these limitations and reductions might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.\nThe partnership agreement of CVR Partners limits the liability and replaces the fiduciary duties of the general partner, while also restricting the remedies available to the partnership\u2019s common unitholders, including us, for actions that, without these limitations and reductions, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty. Delaware partnership law permits such contractual reductions of fiduciary duty. The partnership agreement contains provisions that replace the standards to which the general partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty law. For example:\n\u2022\nThe partnership agreement permits CVR Partners\u2019 general partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity, as opposed to its capacity as general partner. This entitles its general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires, and means that it has no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, any limited partner.\n\u2022\nThe partnership agreement provides that CVR Partners\u2019 general partner will not have any liability to unitholders for decisions made in its capacity as general partner so long as it acted in good faith, meaning it believed that the decision was in the best interest of CVR Partners.\n\u2022\nThe partnership agreement provides that CVR Partners\u2019 general partner and the officers and directors of its general partner will not be liable for monetary damages to common unitholders, including us, for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the general partner or its officers or directors acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct, or in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the conduct was criminal.\nIn addition, CVR Partners\u2019 partnership agreement (i) generally provides that affiliated transactions and resolutions of conflicts of interest not approved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of its general partner and not involving a vote of unitholders must be on terms no less favorable to CVR Partners than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or be \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d to CVR Partners, as determined by its general partner in good faith, and that, in determining whether a transaction or resolution is \u201cfair and reasonable,\u201d the general partner may consider the totality of the relationships between the parties involved, including other transactions that may be particularly advantageous or beneficial to affiliated parties, including us and (ii) provides that in resolving conflicts of interest, it will be presumed that in making its decision, the general partner or its conflicts committee acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any holder of common units, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption.\nWith respect to the common units that we own, we have agreed to be bound by the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement, including the provisions described above.\nDecember 31, 2018 | 41\nCVR Partners is managed by the executive officers of its general partner, some of whom are employed by and serve as part of the senior management team of the Company. Conflicts of interest could arise as a result of this arrangement.\nCVR Partners is managed by the executive officers of its general partner, some of whom are employed by and serve as part of the senior management team of the Company. Furthermore, although CVR Partners has entered into services agreements with the Company under which it compensates the Company for the services of its management, our management is not required to devote any specific amount of time to the nitrogen fertilizer segment and may devote a substantial majority of their time to other business of the Company. Moreover the Company may terminate the services agreement with CVR Partners at any time, in each case subject to a 180-day notice period. In addition, key executive officers of the Company, including its president and chief executive officer, chief financial officer and general counsel, will face conflicts of interest if decisions arise in which CVR Partners and the Company have conflicting points of view or interests.", "PERMNO": 92326, "SIC": 2911, "TIC": "CVI"}
