{"cik": "821002", "company": "G III APPAREL GROUP LTD /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our prospects, our operating results, our financial condition, the trading prices of our securities and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this report. Additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also affect our business operations.\nThe recent coronavirus outbreak is having a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe coronavirus outbreak is having a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. The coronavirus outbreak has impacted our worldwide sourcing operations in China and elsewhere. There is hardly anywhere in the world that is not being impacted by the effects of coronavirus. Travel within and between many countries has been restricted. The length of these travel restrictions is not certain at this time. Travel restrictions may impact our suppliers\u2019 ability to obtain necessary materials and inhibit travel by our employees and our suppliers\u2019 employees. As a result of any travel restrictions, potential factory closures, inability to obtain materials, disruptions in the supply chain and potential disruption of transportation of goods produced for us in China and other countries adversely impacted by the coronavirus outbreak, or threat or perceived threat of such outbreak, we may be unable to obtain adequate inventory from these regions, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Potential financial impacts associated with the outbreak include, but are not limited to, lower net sales in markets affected by the outbreak, the delay of inventory production and fulfillment, potentially impacting net sales, and potential incremental costs associated with mitigating the effects of the outbreak. As our suppliers open their factories for production, we will need to balance the production orders given to these factories against the demand for our products in the United States.\nRestrictions on travel and group gatherings, the closing of restaurants, sports leagues and all forms of communal entertainment and the fear of contracting coronavirus has materially adversely affected store traffic and retail sales. In addition, many retail store chains and shopping malls have announced closures for periods of time. The restrictions imposed as a result of the coronavirus outbreak and the closing of retail stores in connection with the outbreak are causing a significant adverse effect on the economy in the United States and around the world. If the retail economy continues to weaken and/or consumers reduce purchases in the near or long-term as a result of the negative effects of the coronavirus on the U.S. and worldwide economies due to the coronavirus outbreak, retailers may need to further reduce or limit store operations, close additional stores and be more cautious with orders. A slowing or changing economy as a result of the coronavirus outbreak and the governmental restrictions imposed in the United States and around the world as a result thereof would adversely affect the financial health of our retail, distributor and joint venture partners, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe coronavirus outbreak is ongoing, and its dynamic nature, including uncertainties relating to the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, and the restrictive actions that are being taken by governmental authorities in the United States and around the world to contain the outbreak or to treat its impact makes it difficult to forecast its effects on our fiscal 2021 results. While it is difficult at this time to predict the magnitude of the effect of the coronavirus outbreak, we expect our results for fiscal 2021 to be materially adversely affected compared to fiscal 2020 as a result of the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Wholesale Operations\nThe failure to maintain our license agreements could cause us to lose significant revenues and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on sales of licensed products for a substantial portion of our revenues. In fiscal 2020, net sales of licensed product accounted for 59.4% of our net sales compared to 57.4% of our net sales in fiscal 2019 and 58.6% of our net sales in fiscal 2018.\nWe are generally required to achieve specified minimum net sales, make specified royalty and advertising payments and receive prior approval of the licensor as to all design and other elements of a product prior to production. License agreements also may restrict our ability to enter into other license agreements for competing products or acquire businesses that produce competing products without the consent of the licensor. If we do not satisfy any of these requirements or receive approval with respect to a restricted transaction, a licensor usually will have the right to terminate our license. Even if a licensor does not terminate our license, the failure to achieve net sales sufficient to cover our required minimum royalty payments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If a license contains a renewal provision, there are usually minimum net sales and other conditions that must be met in order to be able to renew a license. Even if we comply with all the terms of a license agreement, we cannot be sure that we will be able to renew an agreement when it expires even if we desire to do so. The failure to maintain or renew our license agreements could cause us to lose significant revenue and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur success is dependent on the strategies and reputation of our licensors.\nWe strive to offer our products on a multiple brand, multiple channel and multiple price point basis. As a part of this strategy, we license the names and brands of numerous recognized companies and designers. In entering into these license agreements, we plan our products to be targeted towards different market segments based on consumer demographics, design, suggested pricing and channel of distribution. If any of our licensors decides to \u201creposition\u201d its products under the brands we license from them, introduce similar products under similar brand names or otherwise change the parameters of design, pricing, distribution, target market or competitive set, we could experience a significant downturn in that brand\u2019s business, adversely affecting our sales and profitability. In addition, as licensed products may be personally associated with designers, our sales of those products could be materially and adversely affected if any of those individuals\u2019 images, reputations or popularity were to be negatively impacted.\nAny adverse change in our relationship with PVH and its Calvin Klein or Tommy Hilfiger brands would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have ten different license agreements relating to a variety of products sold under the Calvin Klein brand that is owned by PVH. We have three different license agreements for products sold under the Tommy Hilfiger brand, which is also owned by PVH. Net sales of these two brands owned by PVH constituted approximately 50% of our net sales in fiscal 2020 and approximately 46% of our net sales in fiscal 2019. Any adverse change in our relationship with PVH, or in the reputation of Calvin Klein or Tommy Hilfiger, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business and the success of our products could be harmed if we are unable to maintain or enhance the images of our proprietary brands.\nThe growth of our proprietary brands, their favorable images and our customers\u2019 connection to our brands has contributed to our success. The ownership of the DKNY and Donna Karan brands expanded our portfolio of proprietary brands that also includes G.H. Bass, Vilebrequin and Andrew Marc, among others. In addition, brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions of a variety of qualities, including merchandise quality and corporate integrity. Negative claims or publicity regarding G-III, our brands or our products could adversely affect our reputation and sales regardless of whether such claims are accurate. Social media, which accelerates the dissemination of information, can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims. Social media influencers or other endorsers of our products could engage in behavior that reflects poorly on our brands and may be attributed to us or otherwise adversely affect us. Any harm to our brands or reputation could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIf our customers change their buying patterns, request additional allowances, develop their own private label brands or enter into agreements with national brand manufacturers to sell their products on an exclusive basis, our sales to these customers could be materially adversely affected.\nOur customers\u2019 buying patterns, as well as the need to provide additional allowances to customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Customers\u2019 strategic initiatives, including developing their own private labels brands, selling national brands on an exclusive basis or reducing the number of vendors they purchase from, could also impact our sales to these customers. There is a trend among major retailers to concentrate purchasing among a narrowing group of vendors. To the extent that any of our key customers reduces the number of its vendors and, as a result, reduces or eliminates purchases from us, there could be a material adverse effect on us.\nWe have significant customer concentration, and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our business.\nOur ten largest customers, all of which are department or discount store groups, accounted for approximately 72.4% of our net sales in fiscal 2020, 69.7% of our net sales in fiscal 2019 and 63.2% of our net sales in fiscal 2018, with the Macy\u2019s Inc. group accounting for approximately 26.3% of our net sales in fiscal 2020, 24.8% of our net sales in fiscal 2019 and 22.2% of our net sales in fiscal 2018. In addition, TJX Companies accounted for approximately 13.2% of our net sales in fiscal 2020, and 12.4% of our net sales in fiscal 2019. We expect that these customers will continue to provide a significant percentage of our sales as they are important customers of our products. Macy\u2019s recently announced that it intends to close approximately 125 stores over the next three years. According to Macy\u2019s these closures represent approximately 25% of its locations and approximately 6% of its annual revenues. Reductions in store count by Macy\u2019s or other large retailers could adversely affect our sales.\nSales to customers generally occur on an order-by-order basis that may be subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer. A decision by our major customers to decrease the amount of merchandise purchased from us, increase the use of their own private label brands, sell a national brand on an exclusive basis or change the manner of doing business with us could reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our results of operations. The loss of any of our large customers, the reduction in stores operated by a large customer or the bankruptcy or serious financial difficulty of any of our large customers, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIf we miscalculate the market for our products, we may end up with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for others.\nWe often produce products to hold in inventory in order to meet our customers\u2019 delivery requirements and to be able to quickly fulfill reorders. If we misjudge the market for our products, we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for others. In addition, weak sales and resulting markdown requests from customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Retail Operations\nOur retail operations segment may continue to incur losses if the restructuring of our retail operations that we plan to implement does not significantly improve our results of operations.\nOur retail operations segment reported an operating loss of $74.6 million in fiscal 2020, $49.0 million in fiscal 2019 and $48.9 million in fiscal 2018. This segment may continue to report operating losses for at least the next two to three years. We reviewed our retail operations and have determined to significantly reduce the number of stores we operate. We are working diligently with our landlords and outside advisors with a view to closing a significant number of stores in order to reshape and right-size our retail operations. We expect to reduce corporate headcount, reduce administrative costs by leveraging functions such as IT, human resources and finance through the use of parent company personnel and reduce the impact of the cost of the warehouse used to support retail operations by also using that warehouse to support our wholesale businesses. We need to successfully implement this strategy in order to significantly reduce the losses in our retail operations with the goal of attaining profitability in our retail operations segment. If we are not successful in implementing and managing our plans with respect to restructuring and operating our retail business, we may not be able to achieve operating enhancements, sales growth and/or cost reductions, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if we are able to restructure our retail operations segment, the long-term effects of the coronavirus outbreak may prevent us from achieving improved results of operations in our retail operations segment.\nOur efforts to reshape and right-size our retail operations and to improve the results in our retail operations segment may not be successful.\nWe may not be able to implement the restructuring of our retail operations segment, including a significant reduction in the number of stores we operate, in the timeframe, on the terms or in the manner we expect. Any of the foregoing could also result in increased costs to us. This could adversely impact our business, operating results, financial position and cash flows.\nIn addition, our attempt to reshape and right-size our retail operations involves numerous risks including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf the inability to retain qualified personnel necessary for the orderly closing of retail stores;\n\u25cf attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce and/or a decrease in employee morale;\n\u25cf higher than anticipated write-offs of assets or lease termination, store closing and severance costs;\n\u25cf potential disruption of the operations of the rest of our businesses and diversion of management\u2019s attention away from our other businesses and operations\u037e\n\u25cf exposure to unknown, contingent or other liabilities, including litigation arising in connection with changes made to our retail operations\u037e\n\u25cf a negative impact on our business relationships or reputation including, but not limited to, potential relationships with customers, suppliers, vendors, lessors, licensors, licensees and employees\u037e and\n\u25cf unintended negative consequences from changes to our business.\nIf any of these or other factors impair our ability to successfully restructure our retail operations, we may not be able to realize other business opportunities as we may be required to spend additional time and incur additional expenses relating to our retail operations segment that otherwise would be used on the development and expansion of our other businesses, which could adversely impact our business, operating results, financial position and cash flows.\nWe have recorded asset impairments in the past and may be required in the future to record impairments of fixed assets or right-of-use assets or incur other charges relating to our company-operated retail stores.\nImpairment testing of our assets related to the operation of our retail stores requires us to make estimates about our future performance and cash flows that are inherently uncertain. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic conditions, our results of operations, and competitive conditions in the industry. Due to the fixed-cost structure associated with our retail operations, negative cash flows or the closure of a store could result in an impairment of leasehold improvements, operating lease assets, right-of-use assets or other long-lived assets, write-downs of inventory, severance costs, lease termination costs or the loss of working capital, which could adversely impact our business and financial results. We recorded impairments related to our retail operations of $19.8 million, net of gain on lease terminations, in fiscal 2020, $2.8 million in fiscal 2019 and $6.5 million in fiscal 2018. We may be required to record additional impairments or other charges relating to restructuring our retail operations. The recording of additional impairments or other charges in the future may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and/or future results.\nLeasing of significant amounts of real estate exposes us to possible liabilities and losses.\nAll of the stores operated by us are leased. Accordingly, we are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing real estate. Store leases generally require us to pay a fixed minimum rent and a variable amount based on a percentage of annual sales at that location. We generally cannot cancel our leases. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may be committed to perform certain obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying rent for the balance of the applicable lease term. As each of our leases expires, if we do not have a renewal option, we may be unable to negotiate a renewal on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations. In addition, we may not be able to close an unprofitable store due to an existing operating covenant, which may cause us to operate the location at a loss and prevent us from finding a more desirable location.\nOur retail stores are heavily dependent on the ability and desire of consumers to travel and shop. A reduction in the volume of outlet mall traffic could adversely affect our retail sales.\nSubstantially all of the stores in our retail operations segment are operated as outlet stores and located in larger outlet centers, many of which are located in, or near, vacation destinations or away from large population centers where department stores and other traditional retailers are concentrated. Economic uncertainty, increased fuel prices, travel concerns and other circumstances, which would lead to decreased travel, could have a material adverse effect on sales at our outlet stores. Other factors that could affect the success of our outlet stores include:\n\u25cf the location of the outlet mall or the location of a particular store within the mall;\n\u25cf the other tenants occupying space at the outlet mall;\n\u25cf increased competition in areas where the outlet malls are located;\n\u25cf a downturn in the economy generally or in a particular area where an outlet mall is located;\n\u25cf the shift to online shopping;\n\u25cf a downturn in foreign shoppers in the United States; and\n\u25cf the amount of advertising and promotional dollars spent on attracting consumers to outlet malls.\nSales at our outlet stores are derived, in part, from the volume of traffic at the malls where our stores are located. In fiscal 2020, our outlet stores continued to experience a reduction in consumer traffic, which adversely affected the results of our retail operations segment. Beginning in fiscal 2021, traffic at all retail stores has been significantly adversely affected by the coronavirus outbreak. In addition, more recently, many stores and shopping malls have announced closures or been required to close for certain periods of time to assist in containing the outbreak. We cannot predict how long this outbreak will affect store closures or purchases by consumers at retail stores nor how large an effect this outbreak will have on retail sales volume.\nOur outlet stores benefit from the ability of a mall\u2019s other tenants and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores and the continuing popularity of outlet malls as shopping destinations. Changes in areas around our existing retail locations, including the type and nature of the other retailers located near our stores, that result in reductions in customer foot traffic or otherwise render the locations unsuitable could cause our sales to be less than\nexpected. A reduction in outlet mall traffic as a result of these or other factors could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to successfully operate retail stores depends on many factors.\nOur ability to successfully operate our retail stores depends on many factors, including, among others, our ability to:\n\u25cf negotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired rent and tenant improvement allowances;\n\u25cf achieve brand awareness, affinity and purchase intent in our markets;\n\u25cf achieve increased sales and gross margins at our stores;\n\u25cf hire, train and retain store associates and field management;\n\u25cf assimilate store associates and field management into our corporate culture; and\n\u25cf source and supply sufficient inventory levels.\nThe retail business is intensely competitive and increased or new competition could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe retail industry is intensely competitive. We compete against a diverse group of retailers, including, among others, other outlet stores, department stores, specialty stores, warehouse clubs and e-commerce retailers. We also compete in particular markets with a number of retailers that specialize in the products that we sell. A number of different competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our retail business, results of operations and financial condition including:\n\u25cf increased operational efficiencies of competitors;\n\u25cf competitive pricing strategies, including deep discount pricing by a broad range of retailers during periods of poor consumer confidence or economic instability;\n\u25cf expansion of product offerings by existing competitors;\n\u25cf entry by new competitors into markets in which we operate retail stores;\n\u25cf adoption by existing competitors of innovative retail sales methods; and\n\u25cf increased consumer preference for online apparel purchases and innovations by e-commerce retailers such as Amazon.\nWe may not be able to continue to compete successfully with our existing or new competitors, or be assured that prolonged periods of deep discount pricing by our competitors will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur e-commerce business faces distinct risks, and our failure to successfully manage it could have a negative impact on our profitability.\nWe are investing in our e-commerce business and seeking to increase the amount of business derived from our e-commerce operations. The successful operation and expansion of our e-commerce business, as well as our ability to provide a positive shopping experience that will generate orders and drive subsequent visits, depends on operating an appealing digital platform and providing an efficient and uninterrupted operation of our order-taking and fulfillment operations. Risks associated with our e-commerce business include:\n\u25cf the failure of the computer systems, including those of third-party vendors, that operate our e-commerce sites including, among others, inadequate system capacity, computer viruses, human error, changes in programming, security breaches, system upgrades or migration of these services to new systems;\n\u25cf disruptions in the Internet or telecom service or power outages;\n\u25cf reliance on third parties for computer hardware and software, as well as delivery of merchandise to our customers on-time and without damage;\n\u25cf rapid technology changes;\n\u25cf the failure to deliver products to customers on-time or to satisfy customers\u2019 expectations;\n\u25cf credit or debit card fraud and other payment processing issues;\n\u25cf natural disasters or adverse weather conditions;\n\u25cf changes in applicable federal, state and international regulations;\n\u25cf liability for online content; and\n\u25cf cybersecurity and consumer privacy concerns and regulation.\nProblems in any of these areas could result in a reduction in sales, increased costs and damage to our reputation and brands, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nLaws on privacy continue to evolve and further limits on how we collect or use customer information could adversely affect our business.\nWe collect and store customer information primarily for marketing purposes and to improve the services we provide. The use or retention of certain customer information is subject to applicable privacy laws. These laws and the judicial interpretation of such laws are evolving on a frequent basis. If we fail to comply with these laws, we may be subject to fines or penalties, which could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any limitations imposed on the use of such customer information by federal, state or local governments, could have an adverse effect on our future marketing activities. Governmental focus on data security and/or privacy may lead to additional legislation or regulations. As a result, we may have to modify our business with the goal of further improving data security, which would result in increased expenses and operating complexity. To the extent our or our business partners\u2019 security procedures and protection of customer information prove to be insufficient or inadequate, we may become subject to litigation or other claims, which could expose us to liability and cause damage to our reputation, brand and results of operations.\nWe are subject to rules relating to the processing of credit card payments. Failure to comply with these rules could result in an ability to process payments which would adversely affect our retail business.\nBecause we process and transmit payment card information, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry (\u201cPCI\u201d) Data Security Standard (the \u201cStandard\u201d), and card brand operating rules (\u201cCard Rules\u201d). The Standard is a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security that was developed by the PCI Security Standards Council to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures. We are required by Card Rules to comply with the Standard, and our failure to do so may result in fines or restrictions on our ability to accept payment cards. Under certain circumstances specified in Card Rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments or other assessments of our compliance with the Standard. Such activities may reveal that we have failed to comply with the Standard. If an audit, self-assessment or other test determines that we need to take steps to remediate any deficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract the management team of our retail business and require it to undertake costly and time-consuming remediation efforts. In addition, even if we comply with the Standard, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. Further, changes in technology and processing procedures may result in changes to the Card Rules. Such changes may require us to make significant investments in operating systems and technology that may impact our business. Failure to keep up with changes in technology could result in the loss of business. Failure to comply with the Standard or Card Rules could result in losing certification under the PCI standards and an inability to process payments.\nRisk Factors Relating to the Operation of Our Business\nIf we lose the services of our key personnel, or are unable to attract key personnel, our business will be harmed.\nOur future success depends on Morris Goldfarb, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and other key personnel. The loss of the services of Mr. Goldfarb and any negative market or industry perception arising from the loss of his services could have a material adverse effect on us and the market price of our common stock. Our other executive officers have substantial experience and expertise in our business and have made significant contributions to our success. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals or the inability to attract key personnel could also adversely affect us.\nWe have expanded our business through acquisitions that could result in diversion of resources, an inability to integrate acquired operations and extra expenses. This could disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial condition.\nPart of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions. The negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses could divert our management\u2019s time and resources. Acquired businesses may not be successfully integrated with our operations. We may not realize the intended benefits of an acquisition. We also might not be successful in identifying or negotiating suitable acquisitions, which could negatively impact our growth strategy.\nAcquisitions could also result in:\n\u25cf substantial cash expenditures;\n\u25cf potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities;\n\u25cf the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities;\n\u25cf a decrease in our profit margins;\n\u25cf amortization of intangibles and potential impairment of goodwill;\n\u25cf reduction of management attention to other parts of our business;\n\u25cf failure to generate expected financial results or reach business goals; and\n\u25cf increased expenditures on human resources and related costs.\nIf acquisitions disrupt our operations, our business may suffer.\nWe conduct certain of our operations through joint ventures. Joint ventures could fail to meet our expectations or cease to deliver anticipated benefits. There could also be disagreements with our joint venture partners that could adversely affect our interest a joint venture.\nWe own 49% in each of two joint ventures, one that holds a license to the Karl Lagerfeld Paris brand in the United States, Mexico and Canada and one that licenses the use of the DKNY and Donna Karan brands in China. We may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Joint ventures involve numerous risks, and could fail to meet our initial or ongoing expectations. The anticipated synergies or other benefits of a joint venture may fail to materialize due to changing business conditions or changes in our business priorities or those of our joint venture partners. Our joint venture partners, as well as any future partners, may have interests that are different from our interests that may result in conflicting views as to the conduct of the business or future direction of the joint venture. In the event that we have a disagreement with a joint venture partner with respect to a particular issue to come before the joint venture, or as to the management or conduct of the business of the joint venture, we may not be able to resolve such disagreement in our favor. Any such disagreement could have a material adverse effect on our interest in the joint venture, the business of the joint venture or the portion of our growth strategy related to the joint venture.\nWe have incurred a significant amount of debt, which could adversely affect us.\nOur indebtedness significantly increased as a result of the acquisition of DKI. We are a party to a $650 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, which replaced our previous $450 million facility, and a $300 million senior secured term loan facility (\u201cTerm Facility\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cBank Debt\u201d). In addition to the indebtedness under the Bank Debt, we also incurred $125 million of debt pursuant to a junior lien secured note in favor of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton Inc. (\u201cLVMH\u201d). The increase in the amount of our outstanding debt could adversely affect us by decreasing our business flexibility and increasing our borrowing costs. The Bank Debt contains certain restrictive covenants imposing operating and financial restrictions on us. These covenants restrict our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, among other things, to: incur or guarantee indebtedness; incur liens; pay dividends or repurchase stock; enter into transactions with affiliates; consummate asset sales, acquisitions or mergers; prepay certain other indebtedness; or make investments. The revolving credit facility also requires us to comply with certain financial covenants.\nThe operating restrictions and financial covenants in the Bank Debt may limit our ability to finance future operations, capital needs or acquisitions or to engage in other business activities. Our ability to comply with financial covenants could be materially affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will satisfy any such requirements. If we fail to comply with these covenants, we may need to seek waivers or amendments of such covenants, seek alternative or additional sources of financing or reduce our expenditures. We may be unable to obtain such waivers, amendments or alternative or additional financing on favorable terms, or at all.\nIf an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Bank Debt, as well as the holder of the LVMH note, may declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable and exercise remedies in respect of the collateral. We may not be able to repay all amounts due under the Bank Debt or LVMH note in the event these amounts are declared due upon an event of default.\nOur debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including:\n\u25cf requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes;\n\u25cf making it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes;\n\u25cf reducing our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our industry or market conditions;\n\u25cf making us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business operations or in the economy; and\n\u25cf exposing us to interest rate risk given that a substantial portion of our debt obligations is at variable interest rates.\nOur ability to continue to have the necessary liquidity to operate our business may be adversely impacted by a number of factors, including uncertain conditions in the credit and financial markets, which could limit the availability and increase the cost of financing. A deterioration of our results of operations and cash flow resulting from decreases in consumer spending, could, among other things, impact our ability to comply with financial covenants in our existing credit facility.\nOur historical sources of liquidity to fund ongoing cash requirements include cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, borrowings through our revolving credit facility and equity offerings. The sufficiency and availability of credit may be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, the tightening of the credit markets, including lending by financial institutions who are sources of credit for our borrowing and liquidity; an increase in the cost of capital; the reduced availability of credit; our ability to execute our strategy; the level of our cash flows, which will be impacted by retailer and consumer acceptance of our products and the level of consumer discretionary spending; maintenance of financial covenants included in our revolving credit facility, interest rate fluctuations and the adverse impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the U.S. and world-wide economies and on our business. Interest rates increased in fiscal 2018 and 2019, but decreased in fiscal 2020. We cannot predict the future level of interest rates or the effect of any increase in interest rates on the availability or aggregate cost of our borrowings. We cannot be certain that any additional required financing, whether debt or equity, will be available in amounts needed or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nAs of January 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the financial covenants in our revolving credit facility. Compliance with these financial covenants is dependent on the results of our operations, which are subject to a number of factors including current economic conditions. The economic environment has at times resulted in lower consumer confidence and lower retail sales. Adverse developments in the economy, including as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, could lead to reduced consumer spending which could adversely impact our net sales and cash flow, which could affect our compliance with our financial covenants. A violation of our covenants could limit access to our credit facilities. Should such restrictions on our credit facilities and these factors occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may need additional financing to continue to grow.\nWe incurred significant additional debt in connection with our acquisition of DKI. The continued growth of our business, including as a result of acquisitions, depends on our access to sufficient funds to support our growth. Our primary source of working capital to support the growth of our operations is our revolving credit agreement which currently extends to December 2021. Our growth is dependent on our ability to continue to be able to extend and increase our line of credit. If we are unable to refinance our debt, we cannot be sure we will be able to secure alternative financing on satisfactory terms or at all. The loss of the use of this credit facility or the inability to replace this facility when it expires would materially impair our ability to operate our business.\nChanges in the method of determining LIBOR or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternate reference rate may increase interest expense under our Bank Debt or future bank borrowings.\nLIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, is frequently used to determine interest rates under bank borrowings. Our Bank Debt uses LIBOR or an alternate base rate (as defined in our loan agreements) to determine the interest paid under borrowings pursuant to our Bank Debt. The financial authority that regulates LIBOR has announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Our current revolving credit facility extends through December 2021 and our term loan extends through December 2022. We will need to extend or replace our revolving credit facility prior to its expiration and may need to do so as well with respect to our term loan. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect on the cost of our borrowings under our Bank Debt or under any other debt we may incur in addition to or as a replacement for any of our Bank Debt as a result of the possible elimination of LIBOR or changes to the manner in which LIBOR is calculated.\nThe Term Facility was the first debt issued by us that was rated by rating agencies. Our credit rating and ability to access well-functioning capital markets are important to our ability to secure future debt financing on acceptable terms.\nOur access to the debt markets and the terms of such access depend on multiple factors including the condition of the debt capital markets, our operating performance and our credit ratings. The Term Facility was the first debt issued by us that was assigned a rating by the major credit rating agencies. These ratings are based on a number of factors including their assessment of our financial strength and financial policies. Our borrowing costs will be dependent to some extent on the rating assigned to our debt. However, there can be no assurance that any particular rating assigned to us will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. Incurrence of additional debt by us could adversely affect our credit rating. Any disruptions or turmoil in the capital markets or any downgrade of our credit rating could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is highly seasonal.\nRetail sales of apparel have traditionally been seasonal in nature. Historically, our wholesale business has been dependent on our sales during the third and fourth quarters. Net sales during the third and fourth quarters accounted for approximately 60% of our net sales in fiscal 2020, 61% of our net sales in fiscal 2019 and 62% of our net sales in fiscal 2018. We are highly dependent on our results of operations during the second half of our fiscal year. Any difficulties we may encounter during this period as a result of weather or disruption of manufacturing or transportation of our products will have a magnified effect on our net sales and net income for the year. In addition, because of the large amount of outerwear we sell at both wholesale and retail, unusually warm weather conditions during the peak fall and winter outerwear selling season, including as a result of any change in historical climate patterns, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our quarterly results of operations for our retail business also may fluctuate based upon such factors as the timing of certain holiday seasons, the number and timing of new store openings, the acceptability of seasonal merchandise offerings, the timing and level of markdowns, store closings and remodels, competitive factors, weather and general economic conditions. The second half of the year is expected to continue to provide a larger amount of our net sales and a substantial majority of our net income for the foreseeable future.\nExtreme or unseasonable weather conditions could adversely affect our business.\nExtreme weather events and changes in weather patterns can influence customer trends and shopping habits. Extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the fall and winter seasons, or cool weather during the summer season, may diminish demand for our seasonal merchandise. Heavy snowfall, hurricanes or other severe weather events in the areas in which our retail stores and the retail stores of our wholesale customers are located may decrease customer traffic in those stores and reduce our sales and profitability. If severe weather events were to force closure of or disrupt operations at the distribution centers we use for our merchandise, we could incur higher costs and experience longer lead times to distribute our products to our retail stores, wholesale customers or e-commerce customers. If prolonged, such extreme or unseasonable weather conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to successfully translate market trends into attractive product offerings, our sales and profitability could suffer.\nThe retail and apparel industries are subject to sudden shifts in consumer trends and consumer spending. Our ability to successfully compete depends on a number of factors, including our ability to effectively anticipate, gauge and respond to changing consumer demands and tastes across multiple product lines and tiers of distribution. We are required to translate market trends into attractive product offerings and operate within substantial production and delivery constraints. We cannot be sure we will continue to be successful in this regard. We need to anticipate and respond to changing trends quickly, efficiently and effectively in order to be successful. Our failure to anticipate, identify or react appropriately to changes in customer tastes, preferences, shopping and spending patterns could lead to, among other things, excess inventories or a shortage of products and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to deliver our products to the market could be disrupted if we encounter problems affecting our logistics and distribution systems.\nWe rely on distribution facilities operated by us or by third parties to transport, warehouse and ship products to our customers. Our logistic and distribution systems include computer-controlled and automated equipment, which may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. Substantially all of our products are distributed from a few key locations. Therefore, our operations could be interrupted by travel restrictions, earthquakes, floods, fires or other natural disasters near our distribution centers. Our business interruption insurance may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions affecting our distribution facilities. In addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the transportation of products to and from our distribution facilities. If we encounter problems affecting our distribution system, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to the risk of inventory loss and theft.\nEfficient inventory management is a key component of our business success and profitability. To be successful, we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate product mix to meet the demands of our wholesale and retail customers without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs to store and hold the goods unduly impacts our financial results. If our buying decisions do not accurately predict customer trends or purchasing actions, we may have to take unanticipated markdowns to dispose of the excess inventory, which also can adversely impact our financial results. We continue to focus on ways to reduce these risks, but we cannot be certain you that we will continue to be successful in our inventory management. If we are not successful in managing our inventory balances, our cash flows from operations and net income may be negatively affected.\nWe have experienced inventory shrinkage in the past, and we cannot be certain that incidences of inventory loss and theft will decrease in the future or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce the problem of inventory shrinkage. Although some level of inventory shrinkage is an unavoidable cost of doing business, if we were to experience higher rates of inventory shrinkage or incur increased security costs to combat inventory theft, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of materials used in our products could have a material adverse effect on our cost of goods sold and our ability to meet our customers\u2019 demands.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials used in our products could have a material adverse effect on our cost of sales or our ability to meet our customers\u2019 demands. We compete with numerous entities for supplies of materials and manufacturing capacity. Raw materials are vulnerable to adverse climate conditions, animal diseases and natural disasters that can affect the supply and price of raw materials. We may not be able to pass on all or any portion of higher raw material prices to our customers. Future increases in raw material prices could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAny raw material price increase or increase in costs related to the transport of our products (primarily petroleum costs) could increase our cost of sales and decrease our profitability unless we are able to pass higher prices on to our customers. In addition, if one or more of our competitors is able to reduce its production costs by taking greater advantage of any reductions in raw material prices, favorable sourcing agreements or new manufacturing technologies (which enable manufacturers to produce goods on a more cost-effective basis) we may face pricing pressures from those competitors and may be forced to reduce our prices or face a decline in net sales, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur trademark and other intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected.\nWe believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position. We may, however, experience conflict with various third parties who acquire or claim ownership rights in certain trademarks. We cannot be sure that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and proprietary rights of others.\nIn the course of our attempts to expand into foreign markets, we may experience conflicts with various third parties who have acquired ownership rights in certain trademarks, which would impede our use and registration of some of our trademarks. Such conflicts are common and may arise from time to time as we pursue international expansion, such as with the international expansion of our DKNY, Donna Karan, Vilebrequin, Andrew Marc, G.H. Bass and Wilsons Leather businesses. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Enforcing rights to our intellectual property may be difficult and expensive, and we may not be successful in combating counterfeit products and stopping infringement of our intellectual property rights, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our trademark and other intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our trademark and other intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights, continued sales of such competing products by third parties could harm our brands and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risk that our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands.\nWe currently license, and expect to continue licensing, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks, to third parties. If our licensees fail to successfully market and sell licensed products, or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations, customer relationships, labor relationships, supplier relationships or credit risks, it could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products.\nWe also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brand. Although we attempt to protect our brand through approval rights over the design, production processes, quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our licensed products, we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brand by our licensees. Although we make efforts to police the use of our trademarks by our licensees, we cannot assure you that these efforts will be sufficient to ensure that our licensees abide by the terms of their licenses. In the event that our licensees fail to do so, our trademark rights could be harmed. Moreover, the misuse of our brand by, or negative publicity involving, a licensee could have a material adverse effect on our brand and on us.\nWe are dependent upon foreign manufacturers.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We also do not have long-term written agreements with any of our manufacturers. As a result, any of these manufacturers may unilaterally terminate its relationship with us at any time. Almost all of our products are imported from independent foreign manufacturers. The failure of these manufacturers to meet required quality standards could damage our relationships with our customers. In addition, the failure by these manufacturers to ship products to us in a timely manner could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers. The failure to make timely deliveries could cause customers to cancel orders, refuse to accept delivery of products or demand reduced prices.\nWhile we source our products from many different manufacturers, we rely on a few manufacturers for a significant amount of our products. We sourced 11.4% of our purchases in fiscal 2020, 14.4% of our purchases in fiscal 2019 and 14.7% of our purchases in fiscal 2018 from one vendor in China. The loss of key vendors or a disruption in receipt of products from key vendors could adversely affect our ability to deliver goods to our customers on time and in the requested quantities.\nWe are also dependent on these manufacturers for compliance with our policies and the policies of our licensors and customers regarding labor practices employed by factories that manufacture product for us. Any failure by these manufacturers to comply with required labor standards or any other divergence in their labor or other practices from those generally considered ethical in the United States and the potential negative publicity relating to any of these events, could result in a violation by us of our license agreements, and harm us and our reputation. In addition, a manufacturer\u2019s failure to comply with safety or content regulations and standards could result in substantial liability and harm to our reputation.\nThe use of foreign manufacturers subjects us to additional risks.\nOur arrangements with foreign manufacturers are subject to the usual risks of engaging in business abroad, including currency fluctuations, political or labor instability and potential import restrictions, duties and tariffs. We do not maintain insurance for the potential lost profits due to disruptions of our overseas manufacturers. Because our products are produced abroad, most significantly in China, political or economic instability in China or elsewhere could cause substantial disruption in the business of our foreign manufacturers. Products sourced from China represented approximately 49.5% of our inventory purchased in fiscal 2020, 61.5% of our inventory purchased in fiscal 2019 and 65.1% of our inventory purchased in fiscal 2018.\nOur expansion into the European market exposes us to uncertain economic conditions in the Euro zone.\nDemand for our products depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries in which we do business. We are attempting to expand our presence in the European markets, including for our DKNY, Donna Karan and Vilebrequin businesses. The strength of the economy in Europe is uncertain and has been significantly affected by the impacts of the coronavirus outbreak. There is some concern that certain European countries may default in payments due on their national debt obligations and from related European financial restructuring efforts. If such defaults were to occur, or if European financial restructuring efforts create their own instability, current instability in the global credit markets may increase. Continued financial instability in Europe could adversely affect our European operations and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe have foreign currency exposures relating to buying and selling in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our functional currency.\nWe have foreign currency exposure related to foreign denominated revenues and costs, which must be translated into U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our reported earnings and the comparability of period-to-period results of operations. In addition, while certain currencies (notably the Hong Kong dollar and Chinese Renminbi) are currently managed in value in relation to the U.S. dollar by foreign central banks or governmental entities, such conditions may change, thereby exposing us to various risks as a result.\nCertain of our foreign operations purchase products from suppliers denominated in U.S. dollars and Euros, which may expose such operations to increases in cost of goods sold (thereby lowering profit margins) as a result of foreign currency fluctuations. Our exposures are primarily concentrated in the Euro. Changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we and our foreign competitors purchase and sell products in the same market and the cost of certain items required in our operations. In addition, certain of our foreign operations have receivables or payables denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies, which exposes such operations to foreign exchange losses as a result of foreign currency fluctuations. Such fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are not currently engaged in any hedging activities to protect against currency risks. If there is downward pressure on the value of the dollar, our purchase prices for our products could increase. We may not be able to offset an increase in product costs with a price increase to our customers.\nChanges in tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could impact our business.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent on the allocation of revenue and expenses in various jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes. Changes in the U.S. federal, state, and international tax legislations can have an adverse impact on our income tax liabilities and effective tax rate. Although we believe our income tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcomes may have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nOur future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business operations, changes in tax laws or rulings, or developments in government tax examinations. A number of countries are actively pursuing fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to multinational companies. Furthermore, tax authorities may choose to examine or investigate our tax reporting or tax liability, including an examination of our existing transfer pricing policies. Adverse outcomes from examinations may lead to adjustments to our income tax liabilities or provisions for uncertain tax position reserves.\nWe are required to pay taxes other than income taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property, and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various other jurisdictions. Tax authorities regularly examine these non-income taxes. The outcomes from these examinations, changes in the business, changes in applicable tax rules or other tax matters may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with international operations.\nOur ability to capitalize on the potential of our international operations, including to realize the benefits of our DKNY, Donna Karan and Vilebrequin businesses and successfully expand into international markets, is subject to risks associated with international operations. These include:\n\u25cf the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, including trade and labor restrictions;\n\u25cf local product preferences and product requirements;\n\u25cf more stringent regulation relating to privacy and data access to, or use of, commercial or personal information, particularly in Europe;\n\u25cf less rigorous protection of intellectual property;\n\u25cf compliance with United States and other country laws relating to foreign operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. companies from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business;\n\u25cf unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and\n\u25cf new tariffs or other barriers in international markets.\nWe are also subject to general political and economic risks in connection with our international operations, including:\n\u25cf political instability and terrorist attacks;\n\u25cf changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; and\n\u25cf general and economic fluctuations in specific countries or markets.\nChanges in regulatory, geopolitical, social or economic policies and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international business in the future or may require us to exit a particular market or significantly modify our current business practices.\nTariffs that have been and might be imposed by the United States government or a resulting trade war could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe apparel and accessories industry has been impacted by tariffs implemented by the United States government on goods imported from China. Tariffs on handbags and leather outerwear imported from China were effective beginning in September 2018, and were initially in the amount of 10% of the merchandise cost to us. The level of tariffs on these product categories was increased to 25% beginning May 10, 2019.\nOn August 1, 2019, the United States government announced new 10% tariffs that cover the remaining estimated $300 billion of inbound trade from China, including most of our apparel products. On August 23, 2019, the United States government announced that the new tariffs to go into effect would increase from 10% to 15%. The new 15% tariffs went into effect on September 1, 2019, although the additional tariffs on certain categories of products were delayed until December 15, 2019. The announcement followed an earlier proposal by the United States government that would have imposed 25% tariffs on the balance of inbound trade from China, but that were suspended pending trade negotiations with China. The additional tariffs have not yet gone into effect as the United States and China entered into a \u201cphase one\u201d trade agreement in January 2020.\nIt is difficult to accurately estimate the impact on our business from these tariff actions or similar actions or when additional tariffs may become effective. For fiscal 2019, approximately 61% of the products that we sold were manufactured in China. For fiscal 2020, approximately 50% of the products that we sold were manufactured in China.\nThe United States government continues to negotiate with China with respect to a \u201cphase two\u201d trade agreement, which could lead to the removal, lowering or postponement of the additional tariffs. If the U.S. and China are not able to resolve their differences, additional tariffs may be put in place and additional products may become subject to tariffs. Tariffs on additional products imported by us from China would increase our costs, could require us to increase prices to our customers and would cause us to seek price concessions from our vendors. If we are unable to increase prices to offset an increase in tariffs, this would result in our realizing lower gross margins on the products sold by us and will negatively impact our operating results. We have engaged in a number of efforts to mitigate the effect on our results of operations of increases in tariffs on products imported by us from China, including accelerating the receipt of inventory, diversifying our sourcing network by arranging to move production out of China, negotiating with our vendors in China to receive vendor support to lessen the impact of increased tariffs on our cost of goods sold, and discussing with our customers the implementation of price increases that we believe our products can absorb because of the strength of our portfolio of brands. These efforts may not enable us to offset the adverse effects of any increases in tariffs.\nWe have been audited by the Canadian Border Services Agency (\u201cCBSA\u201d) and are in the process of appealing the CBSA ruling. Loss of this appeal could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn October 2017, the CBSA issued a final audit report to G-III\u2019s Canadian subsidiary that challenged the valuation used by the Canadian subsidiary for certain goods imported into Canada. The period covered by the examination is February 1, 2014 through October 27, 2017, the date of the final report. The CBSA has requested us to reassess our customs entries for that period using the price paid or payable by the Canadian retail customers for certain imported goods rather than the price paid by us to the vendor. The CBSA has also requested that we change the valuation method used to pay duties with respect to goods imported in the future.\nWe secured a bond to guarantee payment in the amount of CAD$26.9 million ($20.9 million) in March 2018, representing customs duty and interest that is claimed to be owed by us through December 31, 2017. In March 2018, we amended the duties filed for the month of January 2018 in accordance with the new valuation method. This amount was paid to the CBSA. Beginning February 1, 2018, we began paying duties in Canada on imported goods based on the price paid or payable by the Canadian retail customers. Duties paid on the higher dutiable value through May 31, 2019 were not charged as an expense in our statement of operations, but were recorded as a deferred expense until the appeal process is concluded. Effective June 1, 2019, we commenced paying based on the dutiable value of our imports in Canada based on pre-audit levels.\nIf our appeal of the audit findings is not successful, we will have to pay the duties and interest that have been secured by the bond. This will result in a charge to our statement of operations for past duties, as well as for the additional duties we deferred or have not paid beginning on February 1, 2018 through the conclusion of the appeal process. In addition, our loss of the appeal would result in increased duties paid in Canada on products imported into Canada and will increase our cost of sales and decrease our profitability unless we are able to pass higher prices on to our customers. This could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we do not successfully upgrade, maintain and secure our information systems to support the needs of our organization, this could have an adverse impact on the operation of our business.\nWe rely heavily on information systems to manage operations, including a full range of financial, sourcing, retail and merchandising systems, and regularly make investments to upgrade, enhance or replace these systems. The reliability and capacity of our information systems is critical. Despite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable from time to time to damage or interruption from, among other things, security breaches, computer viruses, power outages and other technical malfunctions. Any disruptions affecting our information systems, or any delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems or in integrating them with current systems, could have a material adverse impact on the operation of our business. In addition, our ability to continue to operate our business without significant interruption in the event of a disaster or other disruption depends in part on the ability of our information systems to operate in accordance with our disaster recovery and business continuity plans.\nA data security or privacy breach could adversely affect our business.\nWe collect, process, transmit and store personal, sensitive and confidential information, including our proprietary business information and that of consumers (including users of our websites) and our wholesale partners, distributors, employees, suppliers and business partners. The protection of customer, employee and company data is critical to us. Customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information from cyberattack or other security breaches. A significant breach of customer, employee, or company data could damage our reputation and result in lost sales, fines, or lawsuits. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach or attack could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen.\nBecause the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected, we may be unable to anticipate these methods or promptly implement preventative measures. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position. In addition to taking the necessary precautions ourselves, we require that third-party service providers implement reasonable security measures to protect our customers\u2019 identity and privacy. We do not, however, control these third-party service providers and cannot guarantee that no electronic or physical computer break-ins and security breaches will occur in the future.\nOur use and handling of personally identifiable data is regulated at the international, federal and state levels. We must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. For example, the European Union adopted regulations that became effective in May 2018, called the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which requires companies to meet additional requirements regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to exercise certain additional rights with respect to their personal data. The GDPR calls for privacy and process enhancements, accompanied by a commitment of resources and other expenditures in support of compliance. Violations of GDPR could result in significant penalties. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. California recently adopted a new regulation called the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) that went into effect January 1, 2020, with enforcement expected to begin by July 1, 2020. CCPA provides broad rights to California consumers with respect to the collection and use of their information by businesses. It also creates a new and potentially severe statutory framework for violations. The California law could lead to similar laws in other U.S. states or at a national level.\nPrivacy and information security laws and regulations change from time to time, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new processes. The interplay of federal and state laws may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and governmental agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us, consumers and our wholesale partners. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subjected to legal risk. We are also contractually obligated to comply with certain industry standards regarding payment card information. Increasing costs associated with information security, such as increased investment in technology, the cost of compliance and costs resulting from consumer fraud could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially.\nRisk Factors Relating to the Economy and the Apparel Industry\nRecent and future economic conditions, including volatility in the financial and credit markets, may adversely affect our business.\nEconomic conditions have affected, and in the future may adversely affect, the apparel industry and our major customers. Economic conditions have, at times, led to a reduction in overall consumer spending, which could have an adverse impact on sales of our products. A disruption in the ability of our significant customers to access liquidity could cause serious disruptions or an overall deterioration of their businesses which could lead to a significant reduction in their orders of our products and the inability or failure on their part to meet their payment obligations to us, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. A significant adverse change in a customer\u2019s financial and/or credit position could also require us to sell fewer products to that customer, assume greater credit risk relating to that customer\u2019s receivables or could limit our ability to collect receivables related to previous purchases by that customer. As a result, our reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.\nThe cyclical nature of the apparel industry and uncertainty over future economic prospects and consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe apparel industry is cyclical. Purchases of outerwear, sportswear, swimwear, footwear and other apparel and accessories tend to decline during recessionary periods and may decline for a variety of other reasons, including changes in fashion trends and the introduction of new products or pricing changes by our competitors. Uncertainties regarding future economic prospects may affect consumer-spending habits and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Uncertainty with respect to consumer spending as a result of weak economic conditions has, at times, caused our customers to delay the placing of initial orders and to slow the pace of reorders during the seasonal peak of our business. Weak economic conditions have had a material adverse effect on our results of operations at times in the past and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the future as well.\nThe competitive nature of our industry may result in lower prices for our products and decreased gross profit margins.\nThe apparel business is highly competitive. We have numerous competitors with respect to the sale of apparel, footwear and accessories, including e-commerce websites, distributors that import products from abroad and domestic retailers with established foreign manufacturing capabilities. Many of our competitors have greater financial and marketing resources and greater manufacturing capacity than we do. The general availability of contract manufacturing capacity also allows ease of access by new market entrants. The competitive nature of the apparel industry may result in lower prices for our products and decreased gross profit margins, either of which may materially adversely affect our sales and profitability. Sales of our products are affected by a number of competitive factors including style, price, quality, brand recognition and reputation, product appeal and general fashion trends.\nIf major department, mass merchant and specialty store chains consolidate, continue to close stores or cease to do business, our business could be negatively affected.\nWe sell our products to major department, mass merchant and specialty store chains. Continued consolidation in the retail industry, as well as store closing or retailers ceasing to do business, could negatively impact our business. Our largest customer, Macy\u2019s, recently announced that it intended to close approximately 125 stores over the next three years. In addition, Lord & Taylor, JC Penney and Kohl\u2019s, as well as other store chains, have announced their intention to close stores. Bon-Ton Stores, a customer of ours for many years, filed for bankruptcy in 2018 and closed all of its stores. Store closings could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Consolidation could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers. With increased consolidation in the retail industry, we are increasingly dependent on retailers whose bargaining strength may increase and whose share of our business may grow. As a result, we may face greater pressure from these customers to provide more favorable terms, including increased support of their retail margins. As purchasing decisions become more centralized, the risks from consolidation increase. A store group could decide to close stores, decrease the amount of product purchased from us, modify the amount of floor space allocated to apparel in general or to our products specifically or focus on promoting private label products or national brand products for which it has exclusive rights rather than promoting our products. Customers are also concentrating purchases among a narrowing group of vendors. These types of decisions by our key customers could adversely affect our business.\nIf new legislation restricting the importation or increasing the cost of textiles and apparel produced abroad is enacted, our business could be adversely affected.\nLegislation that would restrict the importation or increase the cost of textiles and apparel produced abroad has been periodically introduced in Congress. The enactment of new legislation or international trade regulation, or executive action affecting international textile or trade agreements, could adversely affect our business. International trade agreements that can provide for tariffs and/or quotas can increase the cost and limit the amount of product that can be imported.\nWe cannot predict whether quotas, duties, taxes, or other similar restrictions will be imposed by the U.S., the European Union, Asia, or other countries upon the import or export of our products in the future, or what effect any of these actions would have, if any, on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Changes in regulatory, geopolitical, social, economic, or monetary policies and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our business in the future, or may require us to exit a particular market or significantly modify our current business practices.\nAs previously discussed, the U.S. presidential administration has imposed retaliatory duties against China, and threatened to impose additional duties, in order to reverse what it perceives as unfair trade practices that have negatively impacted manufacturing in the U.S. The administration has also discussed the implementation of other duties that would impose an additional tax on imported goods regardless of origin. It is possible that the United States may impose new trade or other initiatives that adversely affect the trading status of countries where our apparel is manufactured and such initiatives could include retaliatory duties, higher tariffs or other trade sanctions. The administration has indicated it may make modifications to international trade policy or agreements or engage in other restrictive trade practices that may have the effect of reducing the amount or increasing the cost of imported goods. Changes in existing trade agreements or imposition of tariffs on our products imported from China or other countries could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nChina\u2019s accession agreement for membership in the World Trade Organization provides that member countries, including the United States, may impose safeguard quotas on specific products. We are unable to assess the potential for future action by the United States government with respect to any product category in the event that the quantity of imported apparel significantly disrupts the apparel market in the United States. Future action by the United States in response to a disruption in its apparel markets could limit our ability to import apparel and increase our costs.\nThe effects of war, acts of terrorism, natural disasters or public health crises could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe continued threat of terrorism, heightened security measures and military action in response to acts of terrorism or civil unrest has, at times, disrupted commerce and intensified concerns regarding the United States and world economies. Any further acts of terrorism or new or extended hostilities may disrupt commerce and undermine consumer confidence, which could negatively impact our sales and results of operations. Similarly, the occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, fires, floods or earthquakes, or public health crises, such as the recent outbreak of the coronavirus, could result in the closure of one or more of our distribution centers, our corporate headquarters or a significant number of stores or impact one or more of our key suppliers. In addition, these types of events could result in increases in energy prices or a fuel shortage, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of product, disruption in the transport of product from overseas, delay in the delivery of product to our factories, our customers or our stores and disruption in our information and communication systems. Accordingly, these types of events could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations.\nOther Risks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer may be in a position to control matters requiring a stockholder vote.\nAs of March 23, 2020, Morris Goldfarb, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned approximately 8.1% of our common stock. His significant role in our management and his reputation in the apparel industry could make his support crucial to the approval of any major transaction involving us. He may have the ability to control our management and affairs.\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly and could continue to fluctuate significantly.\nBetween February 1, 2017 and March 23, 2020, the market price of our common stock has ranged from a low of\u2009$2.96 to a high of $51.20 per share. The market price of our common stock may change significantly in response to various factors and events beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf fluctuations in our quarterly revenues or those of our competitors as a result of seasonality or other factors;\n\u25cf a shortfall in revenues or net income from that expected by securities analysts and investors;\n\u25cf changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or the financial performance of our competitors or companies in our industry generally;\n\u25cf announcements concerning our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in product pricing policies by our competitors or our customers;\n\u25cf changes in tariff and trade policies;\n\u25cf actual or perceived adverse effects from the coronavirus outbreak;\n\u25cf general conditions in our industry; and\n\u25cf general conditions in the securities markets.\nOur actual financial results might vary from our publicly disclosed financial forecasts.\nFrom time to time, we publicly disclose financial forecasts. Our forecasts reflect numerous assumptions concerning our expected performance, as well as other factors that are beyond our control and that might not turn out to be correct. As a result, variations from our forecasts could be material. Our financial results are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those identified throughout this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the documents incorporated by reference in this Annual Report. If our actual financial results are worse than our financial forecasts, the price of our common stock may decline.\nIf our goodwill, trademarks and other intangibles become impaired, we may be required to record charges to earnings.\nAs of January 31, 2020, we had goodwill, trademarks and other intangibles in an aggregate amount of $737.6 million, or approximately 29% of our total assets and approximately 57% of our stockholders\u2019 equity. Approximately $621.7 million of our goodwill, trademarks and other intangibles was recorded in connection with our acquisition of DKI. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d), we review our goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles for impairment annually as of January 31 of each fiscal year and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable due to factors such as reduced estimates of future cash flows and profitability, increased cost of debt, slower growth rates in our industry or a decline in our stock price and market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows and profitability are based on an updated long-term financial outlook of our operations. However, actual performance in the near-term or long-term could be materially different from these forecasts, which could impact future estimates. A significant decline in our market capitalization or deterioration in our projected results could result in an impairment of our goodwill, trademarks and/or other intangibles. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during a period in which an impairment of our goodwill is determined to exist which would negatively impact our results of operations and could negatively impact our stock price.\nSimilar to many companies, our market capitalization has been negatively impacted recently as stock prices have dropped dramatically in the past month. The uncertainty caused by the coronavirus outbreak has made it impracticable to forecast our business with any certainty for the balance of the fiscal year. As a result, we will likely have to evaluate the value of our intangibles with indefinite lives, including trademarks, goodwill and other long-lived assets, which could result in impairments to such assets in fiscal 2021.\nWe are subject to significant corporate regulation as a public company and failure to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to liability or negatively affect our stock price.\nAs a publicly traded company, we are subject to a significant body of regulation, including the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.\nThe internal control over financial reporting required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may not prevent or detect misstatements because of certain of its limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. As a result, even effective internal controls may not provide reasonable assurances with respect to the preparation and presentation of financial statements. We cannot provide assurance that, in the future, our management will not find a material weakness in connection with its annual review of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We also cannot provide assurance that we could correct any such weakness to allow our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year in time to enable our independent registered public accounting firm to state that such assessment will have been fairly stated in our Annual Report on Form 10-K or state that we have maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year. Discovery and disclosure of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could have a material impact on our financial statements and could cause our stock price to decline.\nThere are significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that have required, and continue to require, the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas. Our efforts to comply with Dodd-Frank requirements have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, an increase in expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time from other business activities. For example, we are subject to SEC disclosure obligations relating to our use of minerals that have a risk of being so-called \u201cconflict minerals\u201d such as columbite-tantalite, cassiterite (tin), wolframite (tungsten) and gold. These minerals are present in a number of our products.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with complying with the supply chain due diligence procedures required by the SEC. The preparation of our conflict minerals report is dependent upon the implementation and operation of our systems and processes and information supplied by our suppliers of products that contain, or potentially contain, conflict minerals. To the extent that the information that we receive from our suppliers is inaccurate or inadequate or our processes in obtaining that information do not fulfill the SEC\u2019s requirements, we could face both reputational and SEC enforcement risks.\nGiven the uncertainty associated with the manner in which additional corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on our operations is unclear. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may require changes to certain business practices, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nWhile we have developed and instituted corporate compliance programs and continue to update our programs in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements, we cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations. If we fail to comply with any of these regulations, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions, fines or other sanctions or litigation.", "PERMNO": 75905, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "GIII"}
