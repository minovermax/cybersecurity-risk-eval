RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThe building products industry is experiencing modest growth and recent improvements in some of our end markets may not continue. Because our building products and to a lesser extent, our construction materials business, are dependent on residential construction and remodeling, our revenues could flatten or decrease as a result of events outside our control that impact home construction and home improvement activity, including economic factors specific to the building products industry and severe weather.\nOur residential building products business and to a lesser extent, our construction materials business, rely upon home repair and remodeling as well as new construction. Between 2007 and 2011, there was a severe slowing of new housing and remodeling and we experienced a significant slowdown in sales activity during these years. Although residential construction and remodeling activity has somewhat improved in recent years in certain regions of the United States, the homebuilding industry continues to experience activity at moderate levels. Modest consumer confidence, unsteady employment growth, limits on credit availability, rising building costs and other factors may adversely affect new construction or remodeling, resulting in continued slow improvement or a slowdown in new construction and repair and remodeling activities.\nWe, like many others in the building products industry, experienced a large drop in orders and a reduction in our margins in 2007 through 2011. In 2007-2009, we recorded significant goodwill impairments associated with our building products business. While some increased product demand has occurred in 2012 through 2016, we can provide no assurances that demand for building products will further improve in the near future. Downturns in United States and Canadian home improvement and remodeling and new construction or in specific regions of the North American economy where we have significant sales could adversely impact our end users and lower the demand for our products, which in turn could cause our net sales and net income to decrease.\nConstruction is seasonal and generally dependent on temperate weather conditions. The majority of our building products sales and a portion of our construction materials sales are in residential construction, which tends to slow down in the winter months. If there are severe weather events such as hurricanes or flooding, or other events outside of our control, construction activities will slow and there may be a negative effect on our revenues. For the winter months of late 2016 and early 2017, our decreased seasonal revenues from our building products and construction materials businesses may result in negative cash flow.\nReference is made to the discussion of the October 1, 2016 change in segment reporting as it pertains to our block product business, included in Item 1: \u201cBusiness\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nTight credit markets could negatively affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Construction lending has increased slowly since its low in early 2013, which continues to adversely affect liquidity for builders, home purchasers and remodelers in 2016 and 2017.\nThe financial crisis of the banking system and financial markets beginning in 2008 and the going concern threats to banks, governments, and other financial institutions resulted in tight credit markets, including home construction lending, mortgages and home equity loans. Low liquidity for builders, homebuyers and remodelers or a tightening of construction or mortgage lending requirements could adversely affect the availability of capital for purchasers of our products and thereby reduce our sales.\nThere could be a number of follow-on effects on our business from limited credit and low liquidity of builders, prospective homebuyers or remodelers, including reduced ability to purchase our building products. These and other similar factors could:\n\u2022cause delay or decisions to not undertake new home construction or improvement projects;\n\u2022cause our customers to delay or decide not to purchase our building products; and\n\u2022lead to a decline in customer transactions and our financial performance.\nOur building products and construction materials businesses have been strengthened by the sales growth of new products. If we are unable to offer new products and expand our new product sales, our revenue growth may be adversely affected.\nPart of our building products and construction materials revenues have come from sales in new product categories. New products require innovation, research, capital for development, manufacturing, and acquisition activities. If we are unable to sustain new product sales growth, whether for lack of new product development, access to adequate capital or for other reasons, sales will follow any future general industry slowdown in construction, which will negatively affect our revenue and growth.\nDemand for our building products and construction materials may decrease because of changes in customer or designer preferences or because competing products gain price advantages. If demand for our products declines, our revenues will decrease.\nOur building products and construction materials are subject to reductions in customer demand for reasons such as changes in preferred home and other building sizes, materials, colors and styles. Many of our resin-based siding accessory products are complementary to an owner\u2019s choice of vinyl as a siding material. If sales of vinyl siding decrease, sale of our accessories may also decrease. Sales of our manufactured architectural stone and concrete block products are dependent on the continuing popularity of stone and block finishes. Similarly, we rely upon architects and other designers to specify block and other building products that we produce.\nDemand for our building products can also decline if competing products become relatively less expensive. For example, if costs of petroleum-based resins that are used to make vinyl siding and accessories increase faster than the costs of stucco, then stucco products, which we do not sell, will become more attractive from a price standpoint, and our vinyl siding and accessory sales may decrease. Manufactured architectural stone and specialty roofing materials could lose price competitiveness compared to other finishes. If demand for our building products and construction materials decline because of changes in the popularity or price advantages of our products, our revenues will be adversely affected.\nA significant increase in the price of materials used in the production of our building products and construction materials that cannot be passed on to customers could have a significant adverse effect on our operating income. Furthermore, we depend upon limited sources for certain key production materials, the interruption of which would materially disrupt our ability to manufacture and supply products, resulting in lost revenues and the potential loss of customers.\nOur manufactured architectural stone, concrete block and concrete roof products manufacturing processes require key production materials including cement, sand, manmade, natural, lightweight and other aggregates, oxides, rolled steel, packaging materials, and certain types of rubber-based products. The suppliers of these materials may experience shortages and capacity or supply constraints in meeting market demand that limit our ability to obtain needed production materials on a timely basis or at expected prices. We do not have long-term contracts with such suppliers. We do not maintain large inventories of production materials and alternative sources meeting our requirements could be difficult to arrange in the short term. A significant increase in the price of these materials that cannot be passed on to customers could have a significant adverse effect on our cost of sales and operating income. Additionally, our manufacturing and ability to provide products to our customers could be materially disrupted if this supply of materials was interrupted for any reason. Such an interruption and the resulting inability to supply our customers with manufactured stone, block and roof products could adversely impact our revenues and our relationships with our customers.\nCertain of our resin-based siding, accessory, trim, composite roof, vinyl window and other products are manufactured from polypropylene, PVC and polyethylene, a large portion of which material is sold to us by a limited number of suppliers. The prices of polypropylene, PVC and polyethylene are primarily a function of manufacturing capacity, demand, and the prices of petrochemical feedstocks, crude oil and natural gas liquids. To a lesser extent, supply also depends upon the availability of recycled materials. Historically, the market prices of polypropylene, PVC, and polyethylene have fluctuated, with material price increases as recently as 2014. A significant increase in the price of polypropylene, polyethylene or PVC that cannot be passed on to customers could have a significant adverse effect on our cost of sales and operating income. We do not have long-term contracts with our polypropylene, polyethylene or PVC suppliers. We do not maintain large inventories of polypropylene, polyethylene or PVC and alternative sources could be difficult to arrange in the short term. Therefore, our manufacturing and ability to provide products to our customers could be materially disrupted if our supply of polypropylene, polyethylene or PVC were interrupted for any reason. Such an\ninterruption and the resulting inability to supply our customers with resin-based products could adversely impact our revenues and potentially our relationships with our customers.\nInterruption of our ability to manufacture and timely ship product orders could harm our reputation and result in lost revenues if customers turn to other sources for products.\nWe produce most of our building products and some of our construction materials in a small number of key manufacturing plants primarily located in the United States and Mexico. Our manufacturing plants or our systems that track customer orders and production could be disrupted because of natural or manmade disasters, accidents, political unrest, terrorism, crime or other problems. Our building products and construction materials businesses are dependent upon rapid shipments to contractors and distributors of individual orders, a large portion of which orders are manufactured upon demand to meet customer specifications. If there is significant interruption of our order fulfillment for any reason, we are at risk of harming our reputation for speed and reliability with customers and losing short-term and long-term revenues if customers turn to alternative building product and construction material sources.\nOur construction materials business is dependent upon governmental infrastructure spending.\nOur fly ash and concrete block products, and to a much lesser extent, our other building products, are used in public infrastructure projects, which include the construction, maintenance, and improvement of highways, bridges, schools, prisons and similar projects. Our business is dependent on the level of federal, state, and local spending on these projects. We cannot be assured of the existence, amount, and timing of appropriations for government spending on these projects.\nFederal and state budget deficits may continue to limit the funding available for infrastructure spending. The availability of credit affects the ability of states and other governmental entities such as cities and school districts to issue bonds to finance construction projects. In addition, infrastructure spending is adversely affected by regions where sluggish economies exist, leading to lower tax revenues and state government budgets. Shortages in state tax revenues can reduce the amounts spent on state infrastructure projects, even below amounts appropriated by the legislatures. Delays in state infrastructure spending can hurt our business. Further, rising construction and material prices constrain infrastructure construction budgets.\nSimilarly, we rely upon architects and other designers to specify the type of concrete block that we produce in certain commercial and institutional building projects. Our concrete block business faces competition from alternative building materials.\nIf HCM\u2019s coal-fueled electric utility industry suppliers fail to provide HCM with high-value CCPs due to environmental regulations or otherwise, HCM\u2019s costs could increase and supply could fail to meet customer needs, potentially negatively impacting our profitability or hindering growth.\nHCM relies on the production of CCPs by coal-fueled electric utilities. HCM occasionally experiences delays and other problems, such as planned and unplanned outages, in obtaining high-value CCPs from its suppliers and may in the future be unable to obtain high-value CCPs on the scale and within the time frames required by HCM to meet customers\u2019 needs. The coal-burning electric utility and coal mining industries are facing a number of new and pending initiatives by regulatory authorities seeking to address air and water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and management and disposal of CCPs, as described below. Although our business managing CCPs for utility customers may benefit from opportunities to manage compliance with some new regulatory requirements, increasingly strict requirements generally will increase the cost of doing business and may make coal burning less attractive for utilities. In recent years, multiple companies have announced plans to close coal-fired power plant units, or dropped plans to open new plants, citing the cost of compliance with pending or new environmental regulations and the relatively low cost of natural gas. A reduction in the use of coal as fuel causes a decline in the production and availability of fly ash, the key product in our construction materials business. The outcome of these developments cannot be predicted. To date, our business has not had a significant impact from plant closures because our national footprint allows us to move fly ash to satisfy demand; however, if closure of coal-powered plants continues, we may be adversely affected in the future.\nEnvironmental regulation affecting the coal industry is ever-evolving, and federal and state regulation in recent years has imposed more stringent requirements regarding emission of air pollutants and other toxic chemicals, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and water quality impacts from coal mining operations. See \u201cBusiness-Regulation.\u201d To meet emissions levels, utilities have been required to make changes such as changing their fuel sources, installing expensive pollution control equipment and, in some cases, shutting down plant units. Adoption of more stringent\nregulations governing coal combustion, water discharges and air emissions, or coal mining would likely have an adverse effect on the cost, quality, beneficial use and sales of CCPs. Faced with the prospect of more stringent regulations, litigation by environmental groups, and the relatively low cost of natural gas, an increasing number of electric utilities are reducing their portfolio of coal powered energy facilities. This reduction could increase if the Clean Power Plan is upheld, which urges states to substitute electricity generation from higher-emitting coal plants to low-emitting coal plants and zero-emitting renewable sources. See \u201cBusiness-Regulation.\u201d If HCM is unable to obtain CCPs or experiences a delay in the delivery of high-value or quality CCPs, HCM will have a reduced supply of CCPs to sell or may be forced to incur significant unanticipated expenses to secure alternative sources or to otherwise maintain supply to customers. Moreover, revenues could be adversely affected if CCP sales volumes cannot be maintained or if customers choose to find alternatives to HCM\u2019s products.\nThe EPA rule under RCRA to regulate the disposal of CCPs is likely to have an adverse effect on the cost of managing and disposing of CCPs. The heightened regulatory scrutiny of CCPs on the federal and potentially state level may have an adverse effect on the uses and demand for CCPs, and on HCM\u2019s relationships with utilities.\nIn April 2015, the EPA published a final rule to regulate the disposal of coal combustion residuals as solid (non-hazardous) waste under subtitle D of RCRA that became effective in October 2015. The rule established national minimum criteria for CCP landfills and impoundments consisting of location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring and corrective action, closure requirements, post closure care, recordkeeping and reporting, and other requirements. The rule requires closure of facilities unable to comply with the new rule\u2019s criteria within five to seven years. The new regulation has increased the complexity and cost of managing and disposing of CCPs. In response to the 2015 rule, Congress has considered several proposals to institute state-permitting programs for CCPs, subject to EPA oversight. While the passage of one of these laws may have a significant effect on the regulatory landscape, the outcome of these legislative attempts is not certain.\nThe EPA remains under significant pressure from environmental organizations, several of which have challenged the 2015 rule. Some environmental groups continue to urge the EPA to restrict certain beneficial uses of CCPs, such as in concrete, road base and soil stabilization, alleging contaminants may leach into the environment. The 2015 regulation created a definition of \u201cbeneficial use\u201d that includes uses in concrete and road base, but changes in the definition could reduce the demand for fly ash and other CCPs which would have an adverse effect on HCM\u2019s revenues. The EPA\u2019s increased regulation of CCPs will likely cause utilities and power producers to impose greater restrictions on the use of CCPs by HCM and its customers. Restrictions imposed by utilities may narrow the types of potential customers to which HCM can market CCPs and limit their uses of CCPs, reducing HCM\u2019s sales opportunities. Utilities are also likely to negotiate to shift actual or perceived liabilities associated with CCPs and their use to HCM through more onerous contract and indemnity obligations. This could harm HCM\u2019s business by reducing the number of CCP management contracts or by increasing HCM\u2019s exposure to the contingent risks associated with any new regulation of CCPs.\nHCM has managed numerous large scale CCP disposal projects, primarily for coal fueled utilities and power producers. In addition, CCPs have beneficial use for road base, soil stabilization, and as large scale fill in contact with the ground. If the EPA decides to regulate CCPs as hazardous waste, HCM, together with CCP generators, could be subject to very expensive environmental cleanup, personal injury and other possible claims and liabilities.\nHCM primarily sells fly ash for use in concrete; if use of fly ash does not increase, HCM may not grow.\nHCM\u2019s revenues primarily are derived from the sale of fly ash as a mineral admixture used as a partial replacement for portland cement in concrete products. HCM\u2019s growth has been and continues to be dependent upon the increased use of fly ash in the production of concrete. HCM\u2019s marketing initiatives emphasize the environmental, cost and performance advantages of partially replacing portland cement with fly ash in the production of concrete. HCM\u2019s business is affected by the availability and cost of competing products in the regions where it conducts business. If portland cement or other competing replacement products are available at lower prices than fly ash because of transportation advantages or some other advantage, our sales of fly ash as a replacement for portland cement in concrete products could suffer, and HCM may not be able to grow or may experience a decline in revenue.\nFurther, utilities are switching fuel sources, changing boiler operations and introducing activated carbon and ammonia into the exhaust gas stream in an effort to decrease costs and to meet increasingly stringent emissions control regulations. All of these factors can have a negative effect on fly ash quantity and quality, including an increase in the amount of unburned carbon in fly ash and the presence of ammonia slip. We are attempting to address these challenges\nwith the development and/or commercialization of two technologies: RestoreAir\u2122, which pre-treats unburned carbon particles and activated carbon in fly ash in order to minimize the particles\u2019 adverse effects, and ammonia slip mitigation, which counteracts the impact of ammonia contaminants in fly ash. Decreased quantity and quality of fly ash may impede the use of fly ash in the production of concrete, which would adversely affect HCM\u2019s revenue.\nIf the EPA decides to regulate the beneficial uses of CCPs, there would likely be an adverse effect on use and sales of CCPs and HCM\u2019s relationship with utilities. Some environmental groups continue to urge the EPA to restrict some beneficial uses of CCPs, such as in concrete, road base, and soil stabilization, alleging contaminants may leach into the environment. This could reduce the demand for fly ash and other CCPs which would have an adverse effect on our CCP revenues.\nBecause demand for CCPs sold by HCM is affected by fluctuations in weather and construction cycles, HCM\u2019s revenues and net income could decrease significantly as a result of unexpected or severe weather.\nHCM manages and markets CCPs and uses CCPs to produce building products. Utilities produce CCPs year-round. In comparison, sales of CCPs are generally keyed to construction market demands that tend to follow national trends in construction with predictable increases during temperate seasons and decreases during periods of severe weather. HCM\u2019s CCP sales have historically reflected these seasonal trends, with the largest percentage of total annual revenues being realized in the quarters ended June 30 and September 30. Low seasonal demand normally results in reduced shipments and revenues in the quarters ended December 31 and March 31. The seasonal impact on HCM\u2019s revenue, together with the seasonal impact on building products revenues may result in negative cash flows for the winter months of late 2016 and early 2017.\nHES remains contingently responsible for certain covenants to the purchasers and for third-party liabilities transferred to the purchasers of our coal cleaning business.\nIn September 2011, we adopted a plan to sell our coal cleaning business. In a series of three transactions during 2012 and 2013, we sold our 11 coal cleaning facilities and associated assets and liabilities which are presented as a discontinued operation. HES may have significant contingent liabilities to the purchasers, if our tax and other representations and warranties prove to be untrue, and to third parties, including land owners and regulatory authorities for site reclamation of disturbed mine lands, where purchasers fail to fulfill their assumed obligations, including the transfer of mining permits and associated reclamation and bonding obligations.\nOur information technology consolidation and continuous improvement initiatives may not result in the intended benefits and could harm our business.\nWe strive to continuously take steps to restructure and achieve improvements in our business, including reorganization and reduction of some management and other employees, and changes in manufacturing, marketing, distribution, pricing and sales of products. In addition, we are in the process of consolidating our accounting, product order and fulfillment, and other information technology platforms. We may not realize the expected improvements to our business if we have made erroneous assumptions about our ability to successfully implement these changes, the demand for our products, and our ability to service that demand. If we are not successful, our information technology consolidation and restructuring efforts may be detrimental to our financial reporting, controls, service to customers and revenues which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business strategy to grow through acquisitions may result in integration costs and poor performance.\nAn aspect of our business strategy continues to be the pursuit of growth through acquisitions of products or complementary businesses. While our ABL Revolver and our senior secured Term Loan Facility limit our ability to engage in acquisitions, to the extent we engage in acquisitions, our ability to successfully implement the transactions is subject to a number of risks, including difficulties in identifying acceptable acquisition candidates, consummating acquisitions on favorable terms and obtaining adequate financing, which may adversely affect our ability to develop new products and services and to compete in our markets.\nDuring 2013-2016, we acquired multiple businesses, and if we do not successfully integrate newly acquired businesses with our existing businesses, we may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisitions, and the resources and attention required for successful integration may interrupt the business activities of acquired businesses and our existing businesses. Successful management and integration of acquisitions are subject to a number of risks, including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations, loss of key employees, diversion of management\u2019s attention from core business operations, assumption of contingent liabilities, incurrence of potentially significant write-offs, and various\nemployee issues, such as issues related to human resource benefit plans, and an increase in employment and discrimination claims and claims for workers\u2019 compensation. Each business acquisition also requires us to expand our operational and financial systems, which increases the complexity of our information technology systems. Implementation of controls, systems and procedures may be costly and time-consuming and may not be effective.\nOur new products and technologies may not be successfully developed, operated and marketed, which could affect our future profitability.\nAlthough we have developed or acquired new products and technologies, and plan to continue to do so, successful commercialization of these products and technologies and their associated businesses in many cases are in early stages. Commercial success will depend on our ability to fully develop the products and technologies and their businesses, including generating demand from customers. We may not be able to profitably operate our new businesses or market our products or technologies produced from them. For example, the sale of our heavy oil upgrading products is dependent on refineries operating under conditions suitable to the performance of our catalyst precursor products, which conditions may not be available.\nOur growth requires continued investment of capital. If we cannot invest additional capital into new and existing businesses, we may not be able to sustain or increase our growth.\nOur operations require both maintenance and growth capital. A key part of our business strategy has been to expand through complementary acquisitions, which has required significant capital. In addition, commercialization of new products and technologies has required and will require significant financial commitments. Our utility services business will require financial commitments such as performance bonds in order to grow and we have limited bonding capacity. Our building products and construction materials businesses also require significant capital expenditures. We estimate that our capital expenditure needs for 2017 will be approximately $45-$65 million. If we do not have sufficient capital to make equity investments in new projects or are limited by financial covenants from doing so, our growth may suffer. Many of our competitors, including large businesses in the building products, construction materials and heavy oil upgrading industries, have greater financial strength than us and may be able to enter our markets, make acquisitions and take advantage of other potential growth opportunities before we can.\nWe could face additional potential liability claims relating to our products.\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims, including class actions, in the event that the use of any of our products results in personal injury or property damage. For example, we face personal injury, property damage, and environmental cleanup claims related to coal combustion products. In the event that any of our products proves to be defective, among other things, we may be responsible for damages related to any defective products and we may be required to recall or redesign such products. Because of the long useful life of our products, it is possible that latent defects might not appear for years. We often do not control the installation or use of our products. Improper use or installation can result in claims of defective products against our businesses. Product liability claims can be difficult and expensive to defend. Our insurance does not cover all liability claims relating to our products. Any insurance we maintain may not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us or such coverage may not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred. Insurance for product liability claims could become much more expensive or more difficult to obtain or might not be available at all. Further, any claim or product recall could result in adverse publicity against us, which could cause our sales to decline or increase our costs.\nSignificant increases in energy and transportation costs that cannot be passed on to customers could have a significant adverse effect on operating income.\nWe purchase a significant amount of energy from various sources to conduct our operations, including fossil fuels and electricity for production of building products and construction materials, and diesel fuel for distribution of our products and for production-related vehicles. In past years, fuel and other cost increases have increased truck and rail carrier transportation costs for our products and may do so again in the future. At times, severe weather, including flooding, earthquakes, and other traffic and transportation impairments and failures have reduced or eliminated access to roads and railways, leaving us with more expensive transportation alternatives. Transportation difficulties and cost increases have in the past and may in the future adversely affect service to customers, the results of our operations and our financial condition. Transportation prices and availability of all petroleum products are subject to political, economic and market factors that are generally outside of our control.\nWe operate in industries subject to significant environmental regulation, and compliance with and changes in regulation could add significantly to the costs of conducting business.\nOur CCP operations and our customers and licensees are subject to federal, state, local and international environmental regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment, storage and disposal of waste products, and impose liability for the costs of remediating contaminated sites, which add to the costs of doing business and expose us to potential damage claims and fines for non-compliance. If the costs of environmental compliance increase for any reason, we may not be able to pass on these costs to customers. In order to establish and operate heavy oil upgrading facilities and power plants and operations to collect and transport CCPs, we and our customers have obtained various state and local permits and must comply with processes and procedures that have been approved by regulatory authorities. These environmental requirements and any failure to comply could give rise to substantial environmental liabilities and damage claims and to substantial fines and penalties.\nOur building products and construction materials manufacturing operations also are subject to environmental regulations and permit requirements governing activities such as the creation of dust, disposal of waste, discharge of water, and the transportation, storage and use of fuel and materials. If we cannot obtain or maintain required environmental permits for our existing and planned manufacturing facilities in a timely manner or at all, we may be subject to additional costs and fines.\nSome of our research and development activities involve coal, oil, chemicals and energy technologies, including petroleum refining. As a result, petroleum and other regulated materials have been and are present in and on our properties. Regulatory noncompliance or accidental discharges, fires, or explosions, in spite of safeguards, could create environmental or safety liabilities. Therefore, our operations entail risk of environmental damage and injury to people, and we could incur liabilities in the future arising from the discharge of pollutants into the environment, waste disposal practices, or accidents, as well as changes in enforcement policies or newly discovered conditions.\nWe are involved in litigation and claims for which we incur significant costs and are exposed to significant liability.\nWe are a party to some significant legal proceedings and are subject to potential claims regarding operation of our business. These proceedings will require that we incur substantial costs, including attorneys\u2019 fees, managerial time and other personnel resources and costs in pursuing resolution, and adverse resolution of these proceedings could result in our payment of damages, materially adversely affect our income and reserves and damage our reputation. See \u201cBusiness-Litigation.\u201d\nWe have significant competition in our industries which may cause demand for our products and services to decrease.\nWe experience significant competition in all of our segments and geographic regions. A failure to compete effectively or increased competition could lead to price cuts, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, which could decrease our profitability. Many of our competitors have greater financial, management and other resources than we have and may be able to take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities more readily. In certain instances, we must compete on the basis of superior products and services, thereby increasing the costs of marketing our services to remain competitive. See \u201cBusiness-Competition\u201d for more information on the competition faced by us in each of our segments.\nIf our internal controls over financial reporting are not adequate, our business and reputation could be harmed and we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties or stockholder litigation.\nMaintaining effective internal controls is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is important in helping to prevent fraud and otherwise protect our business. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, our ability to rely on reported operating results to manage and protect our business could be harmed and we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties or stockholder litigation. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires that our independent auditors report on our system of internal controls. We have documented and tested our system of internal controls to provide the basis for our reports in our relevant filings with the SEC. The growth and diversification of our business through acquisitions complicates the process of developing, documenting, maintaining and testing internal controls. Failure to remediate deficiencies in\nexisting controls or to implement required new or improved controls could harm our business or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. No assurance can be given that in the future there may not be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that would be required to be reported.\nInformation technology vulnerabilities and cyberattacks on our networks could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe rely upon information technology to manage and conduct business, both internally and with our customers, suppliers and other third parties. Internet transactions involve the transmission and storage of data, including in certain instances customer and supplier business and personal information. Thus, maintaining the security of computers, computer networks and data storage resources is a critical issue for us and our customers and suppliers. Information technology system failures that cannot be promptly resolved are likely to result in lost revenues and harm to our business relationships.\nSecurity breaches could result in reduced or lost ability to carry on our business and loss of and unauthorized access to confidential information. We have limited personnel and other resources to address information technology reliability and security of our computer networks and respond to known security incidents to minimize potential adverse impact. Experienced hackers, cybercriminals and perpetrators of threats may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These perpetrators of cyberattacks also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, malware and other malicious software programs that attack our information and networks or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our information and networks. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until long after being launched against a target so that we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. A breach of our IT systems and security measures as a result of third-party action, malware, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise could materially adversely impact our business and results of operations and expose us to customer, supplier, and other third party liabilities.\nUnauthorized use of or infringement claims regarding our proprietary intellectual property could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nWe rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our intellectual property. Despite these precautions, unauthorized third parties may misappropriate, infringe upon, copy or reverse engineer portions of our technology or products. Identification of unauthorized users of our intellectual property can be very difficult and enforcement and defense of rights can be costly. Manufactured architectural stone competitors, heavy oil upgrading competitors and other competitors operate in foreign countries where we may not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or where enforcement may be difficult. We do not know if current or future patent applications will be issued within the scope of the claims sought, if at all, or whether any patents issued will be challenged or invalidated. Our business could be harmed if we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. We have been, and may be in the future, notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights possessed by third parties. If any such claims are asserted against us, we may seek to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. There is a risk in these situations that no license will be available or that a license will not be available on reasonable terms, precluding our use of the applicable technology. Alternatively, we may decide to litigate such claims or attempt to design around the patented technology. In addition, patents may expire before they are a commercial success. To date, while no single patent or trademark is material to our business, except in HTI\u2019s heavy oil upgrading business which relies upon a limited number of material patents, the issues described in this paragraph have not resulted in significant cost or had an adverse impact on our business. Nevertheless, future actions could be costly and would divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel.\nWe are conducting business in foreign countries where intellectual property and other laws, as well as business conditions, may leave our intellectual property, products and technologies vulnerable to duplication by competitors and create uncertainties as to our legal rights against such competitors\u2019 actions.\nWe have and expect to continue to use, license or otherwise make our products and technologies, available to persons and entities in foreign countries. There is a risk that foreign intellectual property laws will not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as under United States laws, leaving us vulnerable to competitors who may attempt to copy our products, processes or technologies. Our limited familiarity with, and the interpretation and enforcement of foreign laws, regulations and legal requirements involve some uncertainty. These uncertainties could limit the legal protection or recourse available to us. In addition, dependence on foreign licenses and conducting foreign\noperations may subject us to increased risk from political change, ownership issues or repatriation or currency exchange concerns.\nFluctuations in the value of currency may negatively affect our revenue and earnings.\nDoing business internationally exposes us to risks related to the value of one currency compared to another. For example, some of our revenues are generated by sales of goods produced in the U.S. to buyers in foreign countries. If the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to the currency of foreign purchasers, the relative cost of our goods to such purchasers may go up, and the demand for our products may decrease, reducing our revenues. Also, in cases where our debt or other obligations are in currencies different than the currency in which we earn revenue, we may lose money as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rates, decreasing our earnings.\nWe are dependent on certain key personnel, the loss of whom could materially affect our financial performance and prospects.\nOur continued success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our senior management and certain key employees. Each member of our senior management team has substantial experience and expertise in our industry and has made significant contributions to our growth and success. We do face the risk, however, that members of our senior management may not continue in their current positions and the loss of the services of any of these individuals could cause us to lose customers and reduce our net sales, lead to employee morale problems and the loss of key employees, or cause disruptions to our production. Also, we may be unable to find qualified individuals to replace any of the senior executive officers who leave our company.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock historically has been volatile. This volatility may affect the price at which you could sell your common stock, and the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThe market price for our common stock has varied between a high of $21.25 in April 2016 and a low of $13.62 in January 2016 during the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2016. This volatility may affect the price at which you could sell your common stock, and the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including the other factors discussed in \u201cRisks Relating to Our Business;\u201d variations in our quarterly operating results from our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors; downward revisions in securities analysts\u2019 estimates; and announcement by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of their stock, many companies have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we become involved in securities class action litigation in the future, it could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources and could harm our stock price, business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe broader stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent months and years. This volatility has affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and may adversely affect the price of our common stock. In addition, our announcements of our quarterly operating results, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets and other developments affecting us, our affiliates or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.\nWe have never paid dividends and do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the future, so any short-term return on your investment will depend on the market price of our common stock.\nWe currently intend to retain any earnings to finance our operations and growth. The terms and conditions of our senior secured credit facility restrict and limit payments or distributions in respect of our common stock.\nDelaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could cause the market price of our shares to decline.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing\nstockholders. In addition, our board of directors has the power, without stockholder approval, to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock, including the adoption of a \u201cpoison pill,\u201d which could be used defensively if a takeover is threatened. The ability of our board of directors to create and issue a new series of preferred stock and certain provisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nThe sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely impact our stock price. As of September 30, 2016, we had outstanding approximately 74.2 million shares of our common stock and options to purchase approximately <0.1 million shares of our common stock (all of which were exercisable as of that date). We also had outstanding approximately 3.5 million stock appreciation rights as of September 30, 2016, of which approximately 3.3 million were exercisable. The sale or the availability for sale of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We have a relatively small number of equity research analysts providing coverage on our common stock. Equity research analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our common stock, and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We do not have any control of the analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to obtain financing in the future and to react to changes in our business.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt, which requires significant principal and interest payments. As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately $768.8 million face value of debt outstanding all of which related to our senior secured Term Loan Facility. We also have $70.0 million of undrawn availability, subject to a borrowing base limitation, under the ABL Revolver. After giving effect to the borrowing base limitation and issuance of letters of credit, we had availability of approximately $59.4 million under the ABL Revolver as of September 30, 2016.\nOur significant amount of debt could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our notes and the ABL Revolver;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and general industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, because a portion of our borrowings, including those under the ABL Revolver, are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less debt;\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing due to applicable financial and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements; and\n\u2022increase our cost of borrowing.\nDespite our current indebtedness levels, Headwaters Incorporated and its subsidiaries may still incur significant additional indebtedness. Incurring more indebtedness could increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nHeadwaters Incorporated and its subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness, in the future. The terms of the secured Term Loan Facility and the credit agreement\ngoverning our ABL Revolver restrict, but do not completely prohibit us from doing so. We have $70.0 million of undrawn availability under the ABL Revolver, subject to borrowing base limitations. After giving effect to the borrowing base limitation, we had availability of approximately $59.4 million under the ABL Revolver as of September 30, 2016. In addition, the secured Term Loan Facility allows us to issue additional secured term loan notes under certain circumstances, which would be guaranteed by our subsidiary guarantors, would allow our foreign subsidiaries to incur additional debt, and would be structurally senior to our existing secured Term Loan Facility. In addition, the indentures do not prevent us from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness. If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.\nIf we default under the ABL Revolver, our Term Loan Facility, or other indebtedness, we may not be able to service our debt obligations.\nIn the event of a default under the ABL Revolver, secured Term Loan Facility or other indebtedness, lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable. If such acceleration occurs, thereby permitting an acceleration of amounts outstanding under our debt obligations, we may not be able to repay the amounts due. Events of default are separately defined in each loan agreement or indenture, but include events such as failure to make payments when due, breach of covenants, default under certain other indebtedness, failure to satisfy judgments in excess of $1.0 million, certain insolvency events and the occurrence of a material adverse effect (as defined in the ABL Revolver). The occurrence of an event of default could have serious consequences to our financial condition and results of operations, and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We will also be required to obtain the consent of the lenders under the ABL Revolver to refinance material portions of our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Additionally, our debt agreements limit the use of the proceeds from any disposition; as a result, we may not be allowed, under these documents, to use proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy all current debt service obligations.\nHeadwaters Incorporated is a holding company with no independent operations or assets. Repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries.\nHeadwaters Incorporated is a holding company and repayment of our indebtedness is dependent upon cash flow generated by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. For instance, if there is a default under the ABL Revolver, the ABL Borrowers will not be permitted to transfer funds to us to pay other indebtedness. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. While our secured Term Loan Facility limits the ability of our subsidiaries to restrict the payment of dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.\nOur debt agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities.\nThe agreement governing our secured Term Loan Facility and the credit agreement governing the ABL Revolver impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness or issue certain disqualified stock and preferred stock;\n\u2022pay dividends or certain other distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022make certain investments or other restricted payments;\n\u2022place restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us;\n\u2022engage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies;\n\u2022guarantee indebtedness; and\n\u2022create liens.\nWhen (and for as long as) the availability under the ABL Revolver is less than a specified amount for a certain period of time, funds deposited into deposit accounts used for collections will be transferred on a daily basis into a blocked account with the administrative agent and applied to prepay loans under the ABL Revolver.\nAs a result of these covenants and restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.\nThere are limitations on our ability to incur the full $70.0 million of commitments under the ABL Revolver. Borrowings under our ABL Revolver are limited by a specified borrowing base consisting of a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory, less customary reserves. In addition, under the ABL Revolver, a monthly fixed charge maintenance covenant would become applicable if excess availability under the ABL Revolver is at any time less than 12.5% of the total $70 million of current revolving loan commitments, or $8.75 million currently. As of September 30, 2016, availability under the ABL Revolver was approximately $59.4 million. However, due primarily to the seasonality of our operations, it is possible that availability under the ABL Revolver could fall below the 12.5% threshold in a future period. If the covenant trigger were to occur, the ABL Borrowers would be required to satisfy and maintain on the last day of each month a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.0x for the preceding twelve-month period. As of September 30, 2016, our fixed charge coverage ratio was approximately 1.9x. Our ability to meet the required fixed charge coverage ratio can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet this ratio. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the ABL Revolver.", "PERMNO": 86042, "SIC": 3272, "TIC": "HW"}
