anti-bribery and similar laws could subject us to adverse consequences.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\u2022The trading price of our common stock has been volatile and is likely to be volatile in the future.\n\u2022Future sales of our common stock could cause our stock price to fall.\n\u2022Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\n\u2022Exclusive forum provisions in our bylaws will restrict our stockholders\u2019 ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\n\u2022Events that are outside of our control, such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events, could harm our operations.\nFor a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, see below.\nBusiness and Operational Risk Factors\nOur quarterly results may vary significantly from period to period, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below investor, analyst or our expectations.\nOur quarterly results and, in particular, our revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, operating margins and net income (loss), have historically varied significantly from period to period and may continue to do so in the future. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Our budgeted expense levels are based, in large part, on our expectations of future revenue and the development efforts associated with that future revenue. Consequently, if our revenue does not meet projected levels in the short term, our inventory levels, cost of goods sold and operating expenses would be high relative to revenue, resulting in potential operating losses. If our revenue or operating results do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts or fall below any guidance we provide to the market, the price of our common stock may decline substantially.\nFactors that may contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly results, many of which are outside our control and may be difficult to predict, include:\n\u2022fluctuations in demand, sales cycles and prices for products and services, including discounts given in response to competitive pricing pressures or to secure long-term customer relationships, as well as the timing of purchases by our key customers;\n\u2022changes in customers\u2019 budgets for optical transport network purchases and changes or variability in their purchasing cycles;\n\u2022the price, quality and timing of delivery of key components from suppliers, including any price or shipping cost increases or delays in the supply of components that may result from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as impacts due to consolidations amongst our suppliers;\n\u2022fluctuations in our customer, product or geographic mix, including the impact of new customer deployments, which typically carry lower gross margins, customer consolidation, which may affect our ability to grow revenue, and products powered by our next-generation technologies, which initially tend to be lower margin due to higher per unit production costs and greater variability in production yields;\n\u2022the timing, market acceptance and rate of adoption of our new product releases and our competitors' new product releases;\n\u2022our ability to manage manufacturing costs, maintain or improve quality, and increase volumes and yields on products manufactured in our internal manufacturing facilities, each of which has been impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022our ability to successfully restructure or transform our operations within our anticipated time frame and realize our anticipated savings;\n\u2022order cancellations, reductions or delays in delivery schedules by our customers;\n\u2022our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses and the costs and availability of components we purchase for our products;\n\u2022any significant changes in the competitive dynamics of the markets we serve, including any new entrants, new technologies, or customer or competitor consolidation, as well as aggressive pricing tactics by our competitors;\n\u2022our ability to manage inventory while timely meeting customer demand and avoiding charges for excess or obsolete inventory;\n\u2022readiness of customer sites for installation of our products as well as the availability of third-party service partners to provide contract engineering and installation services for us, each of which has been impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022any delay in collecting or failure to collect accounts receivable;\n\u2022the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals;\n\u2022any future changes in U.S. GAAP or new interpretations of existing accounting rules;\n\u2022the impact of a significant natural disaster, as well as interruptions or shortages in the supply of utilities such as water and electricity, in a key location such as our Northern California facilities, which are located near major earthquake fault lines, in areas of high fire risk and in a designated flood zone; and\n\u2022general economic and political conditions in domestic and international markets, including those related to any policy changes by the federal government and/or by the presidential administration in the United States, and other factors beyond our control, including the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related response measures.\nSupply chain issues, including delays, shortages and increased costs, and our dependency on sole source, limited source or high-cost suppliers could harm our business and operating results.\nWe are reliant on our global supply chain for the production of components for our products. The global supply chain has experienced disruptions that began in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to delays, shortages and increased costs. Beginning with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and accelerating in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, these disruptions continued to negatively impact our revenue and our results of operations through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. For example, shortages of certain key components adversely affected our ability to deliver products to customers in a timely manner, and price increases by our suppliers negatively affected our gross margin. The global supply chain for components for our products, especially for semiconductor components, continues to experience shortages, longer lead times and increased costs. These shortages, delays and increased costs are expected to continue into fiscal 2022. We cannot predict with certainty the scope or magnitude of the impact that these supply chain disruptions will have on our business and results of operations. Any efforts that we make to mitigate supply chain issues, such as by making additional purchase commitments over a longer time period with our suppliers or by holding higher levels of inventory, could negatively impact our financial results if we do not accurately forecast customer demand or if our customers change their purchasing patterns in response to the evolving supply chain environment. Further, the lead times required for these mitigation efforts may not allow us to meet increased customer demand in a timely manner.\nWe currently purchase several key components for our products from sole or limited sources. In particular, we rely on our own production of certain components of our products, such as PICs, and on third parties, including sole source and limited source suppliers, for certain of the components of our products, including ASICs, field-programmable gate arrays, processors, and other semiconductor and optical components. We have increased our reliance on third parties to develop and manufacture components for certain products, some of which require custom development. We purchase most of these components on a purchase order basis and generally only have long-term contracts with these sole source or limited source suppliers. If any of our sole source or limited source suppliers suffer from capacity constraints, lower than expected yields, deployment delays, work stoppages or any other reduction or disruption in output, they may be unable to meet our delivery schedule, which could result in lost revenue, additional product costs and deployment delays that could harm our business and customer relationships. In addition, these same suppliers may decide to no longer manufacture or support specific components necessary for some of our legacy products, which could lead to our inability to fulfill demand without increased engineering and material costs necessary to replace such components. Further, our suppliers could enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, refuse to sell their products or components to us at commercially reasonable prices or at all, go out of business or discontinue their relationships with us. We may be unable to develop alternative sources for these components within a suitable time frame to be able to operate our business, or at all.\nThe loss of a source of supply, or lack of sufficient availability of key components, could require us to redesign products that use such components, which could result in lost revenue, additional product costs and deployment delays that could harm our business and customer relationships. Due to cross dependencies, any supply chain disruptions could negatively impact the demand for our products in the short term. In addition, if our contract manufacturers do not receive critical components in a timely manner to build our products, then we would not be able to ship certain products in a timely manner and would, therefore, be unable to meet our prospective customers\u2019 product delivery requirements. In the past, we have experienced delivery delays because of lack of availability of components or reliability issues with components that we were purchasing. In addition, some of our suppliers have gone out of business, merged with another supplier, or limited their supply of components to us, which may cause us to experience longer than normal lead times, supply delays and increased prices. We may in the future experience a shortage of certain components as a result of our own manufacturing issues, manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers, capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers, strong demand in the industry for such components, or other disruptions in our supply chain. In addition, disruptions to global macroeconomic conditions may create pressure on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and manufacturing capacity. These supplier disruptions may continue to occur in the future, which could limit our ability to produce our products and cause us to fail to meet a customer\u2019s delivery requirements. Any failure to meet our customers\u2019 product delivery requirements could harm our reputation and our customer relationships, either of which would harm our business and operating results.\nAny delays in the development, introduction or acceptance of our new products or in releasing enhancements to our existing products may harm our business.\nOur products are based on complex technologies, including, in many cases, the development of next-generation PICs, DSPs and specialized ASICs, each of which are key components of our optical engines. In addition, we may also depend on technologies from outside suppliers, all of which may cause us to experience unanticipated delays in developing, improving, manufacturing or deploying our products. The development process for our optical engines is lengthy, and any modifications entail significant development cost and risks.\nAt any given time, various new product introductions and enhancements to our existing products are in the development phase and are not yet ready for commercial manufacturing or deployment. We rely on third parties, some of which are relatively early stage companies, to develop, manufacture and deliver components for our next-generation products, which can often require custom development. The development process from laboratory prototype to customer trials, and subsequently to general availability, involves a significant number of simultaneous efforts. These efforts often must be completed in a timely and coordinated manner so that they may be incorporated into the product development cycle for our systems, and include:\n\u2022completion of product development, including the development and completion of our next-generation optical engines, and the completion of associated module development;\n\u2022the qualification and multiple sourcing of critical components;\n\u2022validation of manufacturing methods and processes;\n\u2022extensive quality assurance and reliability testing and staffing of testing infrastructure;\n\u2022validation of software; and\n\u2022establishment of systems integration and systems test validation requirements.\nEach of these steps, in turn, presents risks of failure, rework or delay, any one of which could decrease the speed and scope of product introduction and marketplace acceptance of our products. New generations of our optical engines as well as intensive software testing are important to the timely introduction of new products and enhancements to our existing products, which are subject to these development risks. In addition, unexpected intellectual property disputes, failure of critical design elements, limited or constrained engineering resources, and a host of other development execution risks may delay, or even prevent, the introduction of new products or enhancements to our existing products. For example, sustained restrictions on the ability of our engineers to work in our offices and laboratories as a result of COVID-19-related restrictions imposed by governments, or us, has made and could continue to make it more difficult for our engineers to collaborate as effectively as desired in the development of new products, which could affect development schedules. If we do not develop and successfully introduce or enhance products in a timely manner, including the successful development of our next generation optical engine, our competitive position will suffer.\nAs we transition customers to new products, we face significant risk that our new products may not be accepted by our current or new customers. To the extent that we fail to introduce new and innovative products that are adopted by customers, we could fail to obtain an adequate return on these investments and could lose market share to our competitors, which could be difficult or impossible to regain. Similarly, we may face decreased revenue, gross margins and profitability due to a rapid decline in sales of current products as customers hold spending to focus purchases on new product platforms. We could incur significant costs in completing the transition, including costs of inventory write-downs of the current product as customers transition to new product platforms. In addition, products or technologies developed by others may render our products noncompetitive or obsolete and result in significant reduction in orders from our customers and the loss of existing and prospective customers.\nOur ability to increase our revenue will depend upon continued growth of demand by consumers and businesses for additional network capacity and on the level and timing of capital spending by our customers.\nOur future success depends on factors that increase the amount of data transmitted over communications networks and the growth of optical transport networks to meet the increased demand for optical capacity. These factors include the growth of mobile, video and cloud-based services, increased broadband connectivity and the continuing adoption of high-capacity, revenue-generating services. If demand for such bandwidth does not continue, or slows down, the market for optical transport networking equipment may not continue to grow and our product sales would be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, demand for our products depends on the level and timing of capital spending in optical networks by service providers as they construct, expand and upgrade the capacity of their optical networks. Capital spending is cyclical in our industry and spending by customers can change on short notice. Any future decisions by our customers to reduce capital spending, whether caused by lower customer demand, weakening economic conditions as has been precipitated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in government regulations relating to telecommunications and data networks, customer or other reasons, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAggressive business tactics by our competitors may harm our business.\nThe markets that we compete in are extremely competitive, which often results in aggressive business tactics by our competitors, including:\n\u2022aggressively pricing their optical transport products and other portfolio products, including offering significant one-time discounts and guaranteed future price decreases;\n\u2022offering optical products at a substantial discount or for free when bundled together with broader technology purchases, such as router or wireless equipment purchases;\n\u2022providing financing, marketing and advertising assistance to customers; and\n\u2022influencing customer requirements to emphasize different product capabilities, which better suit their products.\nThe level of competition and pricing pressure tend to increase when competing for larger high-profile opportunities or during periods of economic weakness when there are fewer network build-out projects. If we fail to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, or if our current or future competitors continue or expand their aggressive business tactics, including those described above, demand for our products could decline, we could experience delays or cancellations of customer orders, and/or we could be required to reduce our prices to compete in the market.\nThe markets in which we compete are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe packet-optical equipment market is competitive. Our main competitors include DWDM system suppliers, such as ADVA Optical Networking, Ciena Corporation, Cisco Systems, Ribbon Communications Inc., Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Nokia and ZTE. In addition, there are several other companies that offer one or more products that partially compete with our offerings. Moreover, other companies have developed, or may in the future develop, products that are or could be competitive with our products. We also could encounter competitor consolidation in the markets in which we compete, which could lead to a changing competitive landscape, capabilities and market share, and could impact our results of operations. For example, in March 2021, Cisco completed its acquisition of optical communications supplier Acacia Communications.\nCompetition in the markets we serve is based on any one or a combination of the following factors:\n\u2022price and other commercial terms;\n\u2022functionality and optical performance;\n\u2022existing business and customer relationships;\n\u2022the ability of products and services to meet customers\u2019 immediate and future network requirements;\n\u2022power consumption;\n\u2022heat dissipation;\n\u2022form factor or density;\n\u2022installation and operational simplicity;\n\u2022quality and reliability;\n\u2022service and support;\n\u2022security and encryption requirements;\n\u2022scalability and investment protection; and\n\u2022product lead times.\nSome of our competitors have substantially greater name recognition and technical, financial and marketing resources. Many of our competitors have more resources and more experience in developing or acquiring new products and technologies, and in creating market awareness for those products and technologies. In addition, many of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at aggressive pricing levels and/or have the ability to provide financing to customers, which could prevent us from competing effectively. Further, many of our competitors have built long-standing relationships with some of our prospective and existing customers and could, therefore, have an inherent advantage in selling products to those customers.\nWe also compete with low-cost producers that may increase pricing pressure on us and with a number of smaller companies that provide competition for a specific product, customer segment or geographic market. In addition, we may also face increased competition from system and component companies that develop products based on off-the-shelf hardware that offers the latest commercially available technologies. Due to the narrower focus of their efforts, these competitors may achieve commercial availability of their products more quickly than we can and may provide attractive alternatives to our customers.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions to our business and operations to date and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in the future. The COVID-19 global pandemic has adversely affected the economies of many countries and has resulted in significant governmental measures to control the spread of COVID-19, including, among others, restrictions on travel, business operations and the movement of people in many regions of the world in which we operate, and the imposition of shelter-in-place or similarly restrictive work-from-home orders impacting many of our offices and employees, including those located in the United States.\nAs a result of these governmental measures and pursuant to recommended safety guidelines, we have temporarily closed or substantially limited the presence of personnel in our offices in several impacted locations, implemented travel restrictions and withdrawn from various industry events. Our work-from-home policy has at times contributed to delays in certain operational processes, including our routine quarterly financial statement close process in the first quarter of 2020, and may have an impact on our operational processes in the future. We have experienced disruption and delays in our global supply chain and manufacturing operations, logistics operations and customer support operations, including shipping delays, higher transport costs, and certain limitations on our ability to access customer fulfillment and service sites. We are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components, and we have experienced capacity issues, longer lead times, increased costs and shortages with certain component suppliers, including for semiconductors, impacting our operational processes and results of operations. During fiscal 2020 and the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we experienced disruptions in customer demand due to delays in the customer certification process resulting from customer facility closures or access restrictions. Some of these disruptions negatively impacted our revenue and our results of operations.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and results of operations in fiscal 2022 remains uncertain and is dependent in part on future vaccination and infection rates, the emergence of new strains of the virus, the continued effectiveness and availability of vaccinations, and broader global macroeconomic developments. We may face further disruptions or restrictions on our ability to source, manufacture or distribute our products due to existing or additional governmental restrictions in multiple countries on business operations and movement of people and products. If we experience pronounced disruptions in our operations or in our ability to service our customers, including due to COVID-19 infections or quarantines among our employees and service providers, or if we face curtailed customer demand, these factors may materially adversely impact our business and results of operations. We could also face negative impacts on our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal 2022 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on our customers, third-party service providers and capital markets.\nProduct performance problems, including undetected errors in our hardware or software, or deployment delays could harm our business and reputation.\nThe development and production of products with high technology content is complicated and often involves problems with hardware, software, components and manufacturing methods. Complex hardware and software systems, such as our products, can often contain undetected errors or bugs when first introduced or as new versions are released. In addition, errors associated with components we purchase from third parties, including customized components, may be difficult to resolve. We have experienced issues in the past in connection with our products, including failures due to the receipt of faulty components from our suppliers and performance issues related to software updates. From time to time we have had to replace certain components or provide software remedies or other remediation in response to errors or bugs, and we may have to do so again in the future. In addition, performance issues can be heightened during periods where we are developing and introducing multiple new products to the market, as any performance issues we encounter in one technology or product could impact the performance or timing of delivery of other products. Our products may also suffer degradation of performance and reliability over time.\nIf reliability, quality, security or network monitoring problems develop, a number of negative effects on our business could result, including:\n\u2022reduced orders from existing customers;\n\u2022declining interest from potential customers;\n\u2022delays in our ability to recognize revenue or in collecting accounts receivables;\n\u2022costs associated with fixing hardware or software defects or replacing products;\n\u2022high service and warranty expenses;\n\u2022delays in shipments;\n\u2022high inventory excess and obsolescence expense;\n\u2022high levels of product returns;\n\u2022diversion of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts; and\n\u2022payment of liquidated damages, performance guarantees or similar penalties.\nBecause we outsource the manufacturing of certain components of our products, we may also be subject to product performance problems as a result of the acts or omissions of third parties, and we may not have adequate compensating remedies against such third parties.\nFrom time to time, we encounter interruptions or delays in the activation of our products at a customer\u2019s site. These interruptions or delays may result from product performance problems or from issues with installation and activation, some of which are outside our control, such as site access limitations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If we experience significant interruptions or delays that we cannot promptly resolve, the associated revenue for these installations may be delayed or confidence in our products could be undermined, which could cause us to lose customers, fail to add new customers, and consequently harm our financial results.\nIf we lose key personnel or fail to attract and retain additional qualified personnel when needed, our business may be harmed.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management, engineering, sales and marketing, and finance personnel, many of whom would be difficult to replace. For example, senior members of our engineering team have unique technical experience that would be difficult to replace. Because our products are complex, we must hire and retain highly trained customer service and support personnel to ensure that the deployment of our products does not result in network disruption for our customers. We believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to identify, attract and retain highly skilled personnel, and competition for these individuals is intense in our industry, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we are headquartered and, increasingly, in certain cities and regions where we have operations outside the United States as well. In addition, we may not succeed in identifying, attracting and retaining appropriate personnel. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, the inability to identify, attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel, particularly engineers and sales personnel, could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives, such as timely product introductions. These risks may be exacerbated due to labor market changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in fiscal 2021 we experienced increased turnover in our workforce as compared to prior years, and we may need to increase compensation levels in fiscal 2022 to attract and retain qualified personnel. In addition, we do not have long-term employment contracts or key person life insurance covering any of our key personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, we may be unable to manage our business effectively, and our results of operations could suffer.\nWe are dependent on a small number of key customers for a significant portion of our revenue from period to period and the loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders from one or more of our key customers would reduce our revenue and harm our operating results.\nA relatively small number of customers accounts for a large percentage of our revenue from period to period. For example, for the year ended December 25, 2021, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 42% of our total revenue. For fiscal 2020, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 43% of our total revenue. For fiscal 2019, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 46% of our total revenue. Our business will likely be harmed if any of our key customers, for whatever reason, substantially reduce, delay or stop their orders from us. In addition, our business will be harmed if we fail to maintain our competitive advantage with our key customers or do not add new larger customers over time. We continue to expect a relatively small number of customers to continue to account for a large percentage of revenue from period to period. However, customer consolidation could reduce the number of key customers that generate a significant percentage of our revenue and may increase the risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers.\nOur ability to continue to generate revenue from our key customers will depend on our ability to maintain strong relationships with these customers and introduce competitive new products at competitive prices. In most cases, our sales are made to these customers pursuant to standard purchase agreements, which may be canceled or reduced readily, rather than long-term purchase commitments that would require these customers to purchase any minimum or guaranteed volumes orders. In the event of a cancellation or reduction of an order, we may not have enough time to reduce operating expenses to minimize the effect of the lost revenue on our business. Our operating results will continue to depend on our ability to sell our products to our key customers. In addition, we must regularly compete for and win business with existing and new customers across all of our customer segments.\nIn addition, the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on global economic conditions may affect the network spending, procurement strategies, or business practices of our key customers. If any of our key customers experience a loss in revenue due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their consumer or enterprise customers, they may reduce or delay capital spending generally or with respect to our products, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe manufacturing process for our optical engine and the assembly of our finished products are very complex. The partial or complete loss of any of our manufacturing facilities, a reduction in yields of our PICs or an inability to scale capacity to meet customer demands could harm our business.\nThe manufacturing process for our optical engine, including the PICs, DSPs and specialized ASICs, and the assembly of our finished products are very complex. In the event that any of our manufacturing facilities utilized to build these components and assemble our finished products were fully or partially destroyed, or shut down, as a result of a natural disaster, work stoppage or otherwise, it could severely limit our ability to sell our products. Because of the complex nature of our manufacturing facilities, such loss would take a considerable amount of time to repair or replace. The partial or complete loss of any of our manufacturing facilities, or an event causing the interruption in our use of any such facilities, whether as a result of a natural disaster, like the COVID-19 pandemic, work stoppage or otherwise, for any extended period of time would cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to be harmed.\nMinor deviations in the PIC manufacturing process can cause substantial decreases in yields and, in some cases, cause production to be suspended. In the past, we have had significant variances in our PIC yields, including production interruptions and suspensions and may have continued yield variances, including additional interruptions or suspensions in the future. Lower than expected yields from our PIC manufacturing process or defects, integration issues or other performance problems in our products could limit our ability to satisfy customer demand requirements, and could damage customer relations and cause business reputation problems, harming our business and operating results.\nOur inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand, either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements with third parties, could harm our relationships with our customers, our business and our results of operations.\nIncreased consolidation among our customers and suppliers in the communications networking industry has had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe have seen increased consolidation in the communications networking industry over the past few years, which has adversely affected our business and results of operations. For example, several of our customers have consolidated in the past. During 2016, Charter Communications acquired Time Warner Cable, Inc. and Altice acquired Cablevision. During 2017, Verizon acquired XO Communications and CenturyLink acquired Level 3 Communications. Customer consolidation has led to changes in buying patterns, slowdowns in spending, redeployment of existing equipment and re-architecture of parts of existing networks or future networks, as the combined companies evaluate the needs of the combined business. Moreover, the significant purchasing power of these large companies can increase pricing and competitive pressures for us, including the potential for decreases in our average selling prices. If one of our customers is acquired by another company that does not rely on us to provide it with products or relies on another provider of similar products, we may lose that customer\u2019s business. Such consolidation may further reduce the number of customers that generate a significant percentage of our revenue and may exacerbate the risks relating to dependence on a small number of customers. Any of the foregoing results will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our suppliers in the communications networking industry have recently continued to consolidate. For example, Lumentum acquired Oclaro in 2018 and II-VI acquired Finisar in 2019. In June 2021, the stockholders of Coherent and II-VI approved a proposal for Coherent to be acquired by II-VI. Supplier consolidation may lead to increased prices of components for our products, deployment delays and/or a disruption in output. In addition, such consolidation may exacerbate the risks relating to our dependence on a small number of suppliers for certain components and materials that are required to manufacture our products.\nActions that we are taking to restructure our business to cut costs in order to align our operating structure with current opportunities may not be as effective as anticipated.\nDuring 2020 and 2021, we undertook certain restructuring initiatives, including the 2020 Restructuring Plan and the 2021 restructuring of certain international research and development functions, in order to reduce expenses, reallocate resources to align more closely with our evolving business model, and improve operating efficiencies. These activities might not produce the full expense reduction, resource realignment and efficiency benefits we expect, which could harm our business. Further, any anticipated benefits from these restructuring initiatives may be realized later than expected or not at all, and the ongoing costs of implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated. In addition, as a result of these restructuring actions, our ability to execute on product development, address key market opportunities and/or meet customer demand could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on various third-party service partners to help complement our global operations, and failure to adequately manage these relationships could adversely impact our financial results and relationships with customers.\nWe rely on a number of third-party service partners, both domestic and international, to complement our global operations. We rely upon these partners for certain installation, maintenance, logistics and support functions. In addition, as our customers increasingly seek to rely on vendors to perform additional services relating to the design, construction and operation of their networks, the scope of work performed by our service partners is likely to increase and may include areas where we have less experience providing or managing such services. We must successfully identify, assess, train and certify qualified service partners in order to ensure the proper installation, deployment and maintenance of our products. The vetting and certification of these partners can be costly and time-consuming, and certain partners may not have the same operational history, financial resources and scale as we have. Additionally, certain service partners may provide similar services for other companies, including our competitors. We may not be able to manage our relationships with our service partners effectively, and we cannot be certain that they will be able to deliver services in the manner or time required, that we will be able to maintain the continuity of their services, or that they will adhere to our approach to ethical business practices. Our service partners may also experience challenges in providing services to us as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We may also be exposed to a number of risks or challenges relating to the performance of our service partners, including:\n\u2022delays in recognizing revenue;\n\u2022liability for injuries to persons, damage to property or other claims relating to the actions or omissions of our service partners;\n\u2022our services revenue and gross margin may be adversely affected; and\n\u2022our relationships with customers could suffer.\nIf we do not effectively manage our relationships with third-party service partners, or if they fail to perform these services in the manner or time required, our financial results and relationships with our customers could be adversely affected.\nIf our contract manufacturers do not perform as we expect, our business may be harmed.\nWe rely on third-party contract manufacturers to perform a portion of the manufacturing of our products, and our future success will depend on our ability to have sufficient volumes of our products manufactured in a cost-effective and quality-controlled manner. We have engaged third parties to manufacture certain elements of our products at multiple contract manufacturing sites located around the world but do not have long-term agreements in place with some of our manufacturers and suppliers that would guarantee product availability, or the continuation of particular pricing or payment terms. We face a number of risks due to our dependence on contract manufacturers, including:\n\u2022reduced control over delivery schedules, particularly for international contract manufacturing sites;\n\u2022reliance on the quality assurance procedures of third parties;\n\u2022potential uncertainty regarding manufacturing yields and costs;\n\u2022potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of high demand;\n\u2022potential variability of pricing or payment terms due to agreement length;\n\u2022counterparty risk, particularly if our contract manufacturers are sensitive to inflation and interest-rate risk;\n\u2022risks and uncertainties associated with the locations or countries where our products are manufactured, including potential manufacturing disruptions caused by geopolitical events, military actions, work stoppages or other social factors, natural disasters or other environmental factors, or international health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022limited warranties on components; and\n\u2022potential misappropriation of our intellectual property.\nAny of these risks could impair our ability to fulfill orders. Any delays by our contract manufacturers may cause us to be unable to meet the delivery requirements of our customers, which could decrease customer satisfaction and harm our product sales. In addition, if our contract manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our products or components of our products in required volumes or our relationship with any of our contract manufacturers is discontinued for any reason, we would be required to identify and qualify alternative manufacturers, which could cause us to be unable to meet our supply requirements to our customers and result in the breach of our customer agreements. Qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and time-consuming. If we are required to change or qualify a new contract manufacturer, we could lose revenue and damage our customer relationships.\nWe must respond to rapid technological change and comply with evolving industry standards and requirements for our products to be successful.\nThe optical transport networking equipment market is characterized by rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards. We continually invest in research and development to sustain or enhance our existing products, but the introduction of new communications technologies and the emergence of new industry standards or requirements could render our products obsolete. Further, in developing our products, we have made, and will continue to make, assumptions with respect to which standards or requirements will be adopted by our customers and competitors. If the standards or requirements adopted by our prospective customers are different from those on which we have focused our efforts, market acceptance of our products would be reduced or delayed, and our business would be harmed.\nWe are continuing to invest a significant portion of our research and development efforts in the development of our next-generation products. We expect our competitors will continue to improve the performance of their existing products and introduce new products and technologies and to influence customers\u2019 buying criteria so as to emphasize product capabilities that we do not, or may not, possess. To be competitive, we must anticipate future customer requirements and continue to invest significant resources in research and development, sales and marketing, and customer support. If we do not anticipate these future customer requirements and invest in the technologies necessary to enable us to have and to sell the appropriate solutions, it may limit our competitive position and future sales, which would have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We may not have sufficient resources to make these investments and we may not be able to make the technological advances necessary to be competitive.\nIf we fail to accurately forecast our manufacturing requirements or customer demand, we could incur additional costs, including inventory write-downs or equipment write-offs, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe generate forecasts of future demand for our products several months prior to the scheduled delivery to our prospective customers. This requires us to make significant investments before we know if corresponding revenue will be recognized. Lead times vary significantly for materials and components, including ASICs, that we need to order for the manufacture of our products and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, contract terms and demand for each component at a given time. In the past, we have experienced lengthened lead times for certain components, and we are currently seeing longer lead times with certain components due to industry-wide supply chain challenges, which makes forecasting more challenging. We may be required to purchase increased levels of such components to satisfy our delivery commitments to our customers as a result of longer lead times for components. In addition, we must manage our inventory to ensure we continue to meet our commitments as we introduce new products or make enhancements to our existing products.\nIf we overestimate market demand for our products and, as a result, increase our inventory in anticipation of customer orders that do not materialize, we will have excess inventory, which could result in increased risk of obsolescence and significant inventory write-downs. Furthermore, this will result in reduced production volumes and our fixed costs will be spread across fewer units, increasing our per unit costs. If we underestimate demand for our products, we will have inadequate inventory, which could slow down or interrupt the manufacturing of our products, cause delays in shipments and our ability to recognize revenue, and result in potential loss of customers to competitors. In addition, we may be unable to meet our supply commitments to customers, which could result in a loss of certain customer opportunities or a breach of our customer agreements.\nOur large customers have substantial negotiating leverage, which may cause us to agree to terms and conditions that result in lower average selling prices and potentially increased cost of sales leading to lower gross margin, each of which would harm our results of operations.\nMany of our customers are large service providers and ICPs that have substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us. In addition, customer consolidation in the past few years has created combined companies that are even larger and have greater negotiating leverage. Our customers have sought and may continue to seek advantageous pricing, payment and other commercial terms. We have agreed and may continue to agree to unfavorable commercial terms with these customers, including the potential of reducing the average selling price of our products, increasing cost of sales or agreeing to extended payment terms in response to these commercial requirements or competitive pricing pressures.\nContinued and increased inflation could decrease the profitability of customer contracts, particularly those with extended payment terms, that are not indexed to inflation. To maintain acceptable operating results, we will need to comply with these commercial terms, develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis, and continue to reduce our costs.\nOur sales cycle can be long and unpredictable, which could result in an unexpected revenue shortfall in any given quarter.\nOur products can have a lengthy sales cycle, which can extend from six to twelve months and may take even longer for larger prospective customers. Our prospective customers conduct significant evaluation, testing, implementation and acceptance procedures before they purchase our products. We incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort during this time, regardless of whether we make a sale. We have seen a lengthening of our sales cycle as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, due to delays in the customer certification process for our products resulting from customer facility closures or access restrictions. Because our sales cycle is long, we are likely to recognize higher inflation-related costs before recognizing the benefits of any price increases that we implement for our products. Moreover, the costs associated with our sales cycle may increase faster than our ability to increase prices. In addition, changes in regulatory requirements or uncertainty associated with the regulatory environment could delay or impede investment in network infrastructures and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause the purchase of our equipment involves substantial cost, most of our customers wait to purchase our equipment until they are ready to deploy it in their network. As a result, it is difficult for us to accurately predict the timing of future purchases by our customers. In addition, product purchases are often subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals and unplanned administrative processing and other delays, including the need for the customer to obtain external financing. If sales expected from customers for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all, our revenue will be negatively impacted.\nAny acquisitions or strategic transaction that we undertake could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have made strategic acquisitions of businesses, technologies and other assets in the past, including most recently the Acquisition. We may engage in acquisitions, divestitures or other strategic transactions in the future. In order to undertake certain of these transactions, we may use cash, issue equity that could dilute our current stockholders, or incur debt or assume indebtedness. If we are unable to achieve the anticipated efficiencies and strategic benefits of such transactions, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected if investors and securities analysts react unfavorably to a strategic transaction or if the integration or the anticipated financial and strategic benefits of such transactions are not realized as rapidly as or to the extent anticipated by investors and securities analysts.\nAcquisitions, divestitures or other strategic transactions can also result in adverse tax consequences, warranty or product liability exposure related to acquired assets, additional stock-based compensation expense, and write-up of acquired inventory to fair value. Divestitures can also result in contractual, employment or intellectual property liability related to divested assets. In addition, we may record goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in connection with an acquisition and incur impairment charges in the future. If our actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses, are less favorable than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur additional impairment charges.\nAcquisitions, divestitures or other strategic transactions also involve numerous risks that could disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management team, including:\n\u2022problems integrating the acquired operations, technologies or products with our own;\n\u2022challenges in divesting assets and intellectual property without negatively affecting our retained business lines;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u2022adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u2022risks associated with entering new markets or exiting existing markets; and\n\u2022loss of key employees.\nOur failure to adequately manage the risks associated with an acquisition, divestment or strategic transaction could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFinancial and Macroeconomic Risk Factors\nWe may be unable to generate the cash flow necessary to make anticipated capital expenditures, service our debt or grow our business.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make anticipated capital expenditures, to enable us to service our debt or grow our business. For example, in each of the fiscal years since the completion of the Acquisition, we have had a net loss and negative cash flows from operations and we may continue to incur losses and negative cash flows from operations in the future periods. Our ability to pay our expenses, service our debt and fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by general economic, competitive, legislative, political, regulatory, public health issues and other factors beyond our control, and our ability to continue to realize synergies and anticipated cost savings. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt or to make anticipated capital expenditures, we may be required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, borrow additional funds or evaluate alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations, including the issuance of equity, equity-linked and debt securities.\nInflation may adversely affect us by increasing costs beyond what we can recover through price increases.\nRecently, inflation has increased throughout the U.S. economy. Inflation can adversely affect us by increasing the costs of labor, supplies and other costs of doing business. In an inflationary environment, our ability to raise prices enough to match the rate of inflation may be constrained by customer resistance and competitive concerns, as well as industry-specific and other economic conditions, which would reduce our profit margins. We have experienced, and continue to experience, increases in the prices of labor, supplies and other costs of doing business. Continued inflationary pressures could impact our profitability.\nUnfavorable macroeconomic and market conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and financial results.\nIn the past, unfavorable macroeconomic and market conditions have resulted in sustained periods of decreased demand for optical communications products and slowdowns in the telecommunications industry in which we operate. Such slowdowns may result in:\n\u2022reduced demand for our products as a result of constraints on capital spending by our customers;\n\u2022increased price competition for our products, not only from our competitors, but also as a result of our customer\u2019s or potential customer\u2019s utilization of inventoried or underutilized products, which could put additional downward pressure on our near-term gross profits;\n\u2022risk of excess or obsolete inventories;\n\u2022our customers facing financial difficulties, including bankruptcy;\n\u2022excess manufacturing capacity and higher associated overhead costs as a percentage of revenue; and\n\u2022more limited ability to accurately forecast our business and future financial performance.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have negatively affected the economies of many countries and have created significant uncertainty regarding global macroeconomic conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets, credit markets, and supply chains. These\nconditions may also result in the tightening of credit markets, which could limit or delay our customers\u2019 ability to obtain necessary financing for their purchases of our products.\nOur customers may delay or cancel their purchases or increase the time they take to pay or default on their payment obligations due to lack of liquidity in the capital markets, the continued uncertainty in the global economic environment or inflationary concerns, which would negatively affect our business and operating results. Weakness and uncertainty in the global economy could cause some of our customers to become illiquid, delay payments or adversely affect our collection of their accounts, which could result in a higher level of bad debt expense. In addition, currency fluctuations could negatively affect our international customers\u2019 ability or desire to purchase our products.\nA lack of liquidity and economic uncertainty may adversely affect our suppliers or the terms on which we purchase products from these suppliers. It may also cause some of our suppliers to become illiquid. Any of these impacts could limit our ability to obtain components for our products from these suppliers and could adversely impact our supply chain or the delivery schedule to our customers. This also could require us to purchase more expensive components, or re-design our products, which could cause increases in the cost of our products and delays in the manufacturing and delivery of our products. Such events could harm our gross margin and harm our reputation and our customer relationships, either of which could harm our business and operating results.\nIf we need additional capital in the future, it may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.\nOur business requires significant capital. We have historically relied on outside debt or equity financing as well as cash flow from operations to fund our operations, capital expenditures and expansion. For example, in September 2018, we issued convertible senior notes due September 1, 2024 (the \u201c2024 Notes\u201d) to pay the cost of related capped call transactions, as discussed below, to fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the Acquisition, and for general corporate purposes. In August 2019 and as amended thereafter, we entered into the Amended Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank and BMO Harris Bank N.A. to provide additional working capital flexibility to manage our business, utilizing the Credit Facility. In addition, in March 2020 we issued convertible senior notes due March 1, 2027 (the \u201c2027 Notes\u201d and, together with the 2024 Notes, the \u201cNotes\u201d) to raise additional funds for general corporate purposes, including working capital to fund growth and potential strategic projects. For additional risks related to the Notes, please see \u201cCommon Stock and Indebtedness Risk Factors\u201d below. In August 2020, we entered into the Sales Agreement with Jefferies LLC (\"Jefferies\") under which we issued and sold through Jefferies, acting as agent and/or principal, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of $96.3 million, to raise funds for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures. We may require additional capital from equity or equity-linked financing, debt financing or other financings in the future to fund our operations, respond to competitive pressures or strategic opportunities or to refinance our existing debt obligations. In the event that we require additional capital, we may not be able to secure timely additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, and may be affected by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on capital markets. The terms of any additional financing may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, if and when we require it, our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be limited and our business will be harmed.\nOur international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that may harm our operating results.\nSales of our products into international markets continue to be an important part of our business. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, we derived approximately 53%, 54% and 52%, respectively, of our revenue from customers outside of the United States. We expect that significant management attention and financial resources will be required for our international activities over the foreseeable future as we continue to operate in international markets. In some countries, our success in selling our products and growing revenue will depend in part on our ability to form relationships with local partners. Our inability to identify appropriate partners or reach mutually satisfactory arrangements for international sales of our products could impact our ability to maintain or increase international market demand for our products. In addition, many of the companies we compete against internationally have greater name recognition and a more substantial sales and marketing presence.\nWe have sales and support personnel in the Americas, EMEA (with offices in the Middle East) and APAC (including China). In addition, we have established development centers in Canada, China, Finland, Germany, India, Portugal and Sweden. There is no assurance that our reliance upon development resources in international locations will enable us to achieve meaningful cost reductions or greater resource efficiency.\nAs a result of having global operations, the sudden disruption of the supply chain and/or the manufacture of our customer\u2019s components caused by events outside of our control could impact our results of operations by impairing our ability to timely and efficiently deliver our products or provide installation and maintenance services to our customers. For example, the global COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt the global supply chain for certain components necessary for our products and could continue to threaten the health and safety of our employees.\nOur international operations are subject to inherent risks, and our future results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:\n\u2022greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;\n\u2022difficulties of managing and staffing international offices, and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;\n\u2022political, social and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, political unrest, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions;\n\u2022tariff and trade barriers and other regulatory requirements, contractual limitations, or customer specifications impacting our ability to sell or develop our products in certain foreign markets;\n\u2022less effective protection of intellectual property than is afforded to us in the United States or other developed countries;\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, and health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022changes to free trade agreements, trade protection measures, tariffs, export compliance, domestic preference procurement requirements, qualification to transact business and additional regulatory requirements, including changes related to policy and other changes made by the federal government in the United States; and\n\u2022effects of changes in currency exchange rates, particularly relative increases in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies that could negatively affect our financial results and cash flows.\nInternational customers may also require that we comply with certain testing or customization of our products to conform to local standards. The product development costs to test or customize our products could be extensive and a material expense for us.\nOur international operations are subject to increasingly complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including but not limited to anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the \"FCPA\"), and the UK Bribery Act, antitrust or competition laws, anti-money laundering laws, various trade controls, national security related regulations, and data privacy laws, among others. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies, procedures and training designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no complete assurance that any individual employee, contractor or agent will not violate our policies. Additionally, the costs of complying with these laws (including the costs of investigations, auditing and monitoring) could also adversely affect our current or future business.\nAs we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to effectively anticipate and manage these and other risks and expenses associated with our international operations. For example, political instability and uncertainty in the European Union (the \"E.U.\") and, in particular, the United Kingdom's exit from the E.U., could slow economic growth in the region, affect foreign exchange rates, and could have a negative impact on near-term economic activity, leading to our customers delaying purchases of our products. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and reduce our international sales, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate, which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income.\nOur effective tax rate and the amount of our taxable income could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:\n\u2022changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;\n\u2022changes in the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;\n\u2022changing tax laws, regulations, rates and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate;\n\u2022changes to the financial accounting rules for income taxes;\n\u2022the tax effects of acquisitions; and\n\u2022the resolution of issues arising from tax audits.\nFor example, the Biden administration has proposed tax reform legislation to increase the U.S. corporate income tax rate, increase U.S. taxation of international business operations and impose a global minimum tax, which could result in increased marginal corporate tax rates. The global minimum tax is also supported by numerous countries and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\"OECD\"). Such countries, the OECD and other organizations are also actively considering changes to existing tax laws or have proposed or enacted new laws that could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate our business. Any changes in federal, state or international tax laws or tax rulings could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nA portion of our sales and expenses stem from countries outside of the United States, and are in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and therefore subject to foreign currency fluctuation. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency rates could have a material impact on our financial results in future periods. We currently enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain non-functional currency account balances. These forward contracts reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on certain transactions, but do not cover all foreign-denominated transactions and therefore do not entirely eliminate the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur debt obligations may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital and will be a burden on our future cash resources, particularly if we elect to settle these obligations in cash upon conversion or upon maturity or required repurchase.\nAs of December 25, 2021, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes and the 2027 Notes was $402.5 million and $200.0 million, respectively. The degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, litigation, general corporate or other purposes may be limited; and\n\u2022a substantial portion of our future cash balance may be dedicated to the payment of the principal of our indebtedness as we have stated the intention to pay the principal amount of each series Notes in cash upon conversion or when otherwise due, such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business.\nOur ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments, including the Notes, depends on our future cash flow performance. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, as well as other factors that may be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate positive cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations. As a result, we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, less able to withstand competitive pressures and less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with conversions of the 2024 Notes, and thereby dilute our existing stockholders and potentially adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the event that some or all of each series of Notes are converted and we elect to deliver shares of common stock, the ownership interests of existing stockholders will be diluted, and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. In addition, the anticipated conversion of any series of Notes could depress the market price of our common stock.\nThe fundamental change provisions of the 2024 Notes and the 2027 Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.\nIf a fundamental change, such as an acquisition of our company, occurs prior to the maturity of the 2024 Notes or 2027 Notes, holders of the applicable series of Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes of such series. In addition, if such fundamental change also constitutes a make-whole fundamental change, the conversion rate for the applicable series of Notes may be increased upon conversion of the such series of Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. Any increase in the conversion rate will be determined based on the date on which the make-whole fundamental change occurs or becomes effective and the price paid (or deemed paid) per share of our common stock in such transaction. Any such increase will be dilutive to our existing stockholders. Our obligation to repurchase any series of Notes or increase the conversion rate upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change may, in certain circumstances, delay or prevent a takeover of us that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders.\nThe Capped Calls may affect the value of the 2024 Notes and our common stock.\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, we entered into capped call transactions (the \"Capped Calls\") with certain financial institutions who are the option counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce or offset the potential dilution upon conversion of the 2024 Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2024 Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.\nFrom time to time, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 2024 Notes. This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the Capped Calls.\nThe option counterparties to the capped call transactions are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them might default under the capped call transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Past global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If an option\ncounterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under the capped call transactions with such option counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.\nLegal and Regulatory Risk Factors\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed, or we could incur significant expense to enforce our rights.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of methods to protect our intellectual property, including limiting access to certain information, and utilizing trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. The steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate to preclude misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, and our ability to police such misappropriation, unauthorized disclosure or infringement is uncertain, particularly in countries outside of the United States. This is likely to become an increasingly important issue if we expand our operations and product development into countries that provide a lower level of intellectual property protection. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims, and even if patents are issued, they may be contested, circumvented or invalidated. Moreover, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with a competitive advantage, and, as with any technology, competitors may be able to develop similar or superior technologies to our own now or in the future.\nProtecting against the unauthorized use of our products, trademarks and other proprietary rights is expensive, difficult, time consuming and, in some cases, impossible. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of management resources, either of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights than we do. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nClaims by others that we infringe on their intellectual property rights could harm our business.\nOur industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. In particular, many leading companies in the optical transport networking industry, including our competitors, have extensive patent portfolios with respect to optical transport networking technology. In addition, non-practicing patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. We expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps in technology implementation occur. From time to time, third parties may assert exclusive patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are important to our business or seek to invalidate the proprietary rights that we hold. Competitors or other third parties have asserted, and may continue to assert claims or initiate litigation or other proceedings against us or our manufacturers, suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights, or seeking to invalidate our proprietary rights, with respect to our products and technology. In addition, in the past we have had certain patent licenses with third parties that have not been renewed, and if we cannot successfully renew these licenses, we could face claims of infringement. In the event that we are unsuccessful in defending against any such claims, or any resulting lawsuits or proceedings, we could incur liability for damages and/or have valuable proprietary rights invalidated. For additional information regarding certain of the legal proceedings in which we are involved, see Part II, Item 8 under the heading \u201cLegal Matters\u201d.\nAny claim of infringement from a third party, even one without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, and could distract our management from running our business. Furthermore, a party making such a claim, if successful, could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages or\ncould include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products. In addition, we might be required to seek a license for the use of such intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, which would require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful. Any of these events could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetitors and other third parties have and may continue to assert infringement claims against our customers and sales partners. Any of these claims would require us to initiate or defend potentially protracted and costly litigation on their behalf, regardless of the merits of these claims, because we generally indemnify our customers and sales partners from claims of infringement of proprietary rights of third parties. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers or sales partners, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe incorporate free and open source licensed software into our products. Although we monitor our use of such open source software closely, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. In addition, non-compliance with open source software license terms and conditions could subject us to potential liability, including intellectual property infringement and/or contract claims. In such events, we may be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished in a timely manner, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity incidents, such as data breaches and cyber-attacks, could compromise our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential information and cause significant damage to our business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our networks, including data related to our intellectual property and data related to our business, customers and business partners, which may be considered proprietary or confidential information. This sensitive data includes certain personal information and other data relating to our employees and others. We also utilize third-party service providers to host, transmit, or otherwise process data in connection with our business activities, including our supply chain processes, operations, and communications. Companies, especially in the technology industry, have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber attacks, malicious activity, including ransomware, malware and viruses, and other attempts to gain unauthorized access and disrupt systems and the confidentiality, security, and integrity of information, and we and our third-party service providers and suppliers have faced and may continue to face security threats and attacks from a variety of sources. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our employees are working from home and accessing our corporate network via remote devices, which may be less secure than those used in our offices and thus could increase the potential for such events to occur.\nWhile the secure maintenance of this information and the security of our systems is critical to our business and reputation, our network and storage applications, and those systems and other business applications maintained by our third-party providers, may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached or otherwise compromised due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. It may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such security incidents or breaches and to prevent or mitigate damage caused as a result. Accordingly, a data breach, security incident, cyber-attack, attack using ransomware or other malware, or any other unauthorized access to systems used in our business or unauthorized acquisition, disclosure, or other processing of our information or other information that we or our third-party vendors maintain or otherwise process could compromise our intellectual property, disrupt our operations, and result in loss of or unauthorized access to or acquisition, disclosure, modification, misuse, corruption, unavailability, or destruction of proprietary or confidential information. While we continually work to safeguard our internal network systems and validate the security of our third-party suppliers and providers to mitigate these potential risks, including through information security policies and employee awareness and training, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber attacks or security breaches or incidents, and we cannot guarantee that our systems and networks or our third-party service providers\u2019 systems and networks have not been breached or that they or any components of our supply chain do not contain exploitable defects or bugs, including defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our systems and networks or the systems and networks of third parties that support our operations. We and third-party service providers also may face difficulties or delays in identifying or responding to security breaches and other security-related incidents. We have been subjected in\nthe past to a range of incidents including phishing, emails purporting to come from an executive or vendor seeking payment requests, malware and communications from look-alike corporate domains. For example, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we experienced a phishing attack that resulted in an immaterial loss. While these have not had a material effect on our business or our network security to date, security incidents involving access to or improper use of our systems, networks or products, or those of third-party service providers, could compromise confidential or otherwise protected information, result in unauthorized acquisition, disclosure, modification, misuse, corruption, unavailability, or destruction of data, cause payments to be diverted to fraudulent accounts, or otherwise disrupt our operations. These security incidents, or any reports or perceptions that they have occurred, could cause us to incur significant costs and expenses to remediate and otherwise respond to any actual or suspected the incident, subject us to regulatory actions and investigations, disrupt key business operations, open us up to claims, demands, and liability, and divert attention of management and key information technology resources, any of which could cause significant harm to our business and reputation. Even the perception of inadequate security may damage our reputation and negatively impact our business. Further, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to address any data security incident or breach and to attempt to prevent future security incidents and breaches.\nAlthough we maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain liabilities in connection with some security breaches and other security incidents, we cannot be certain our insurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, including any consequential damages that may arise from such security incidents, that insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms (if at all) or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, or denials of coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nWe are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The provisions of the act require, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Preparing our financial statements involves a number of complex processes, many of which are done manually and are dependent upon individual data input or review. These processes include, but are not limited to, calculating revenue, deferred revenue and inventory costs. While we continue to automate our processes and put in place controls to reduce the likelihood for errors, we expect that for the foreseeable future many of our processes will remain manually intensive and thus subject to human error. If we are unable to implement effective key operation controls around financial processes and successfully manage and monitor manual processes, we may fail to prevent or detect material misstatements in our financial statements, in which case investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our securities may decline. In addition, prior to the Acquisition, we maintained separate internal controls over financial reporting with different financial reporting processes and different ERP systems, and Coriant, as a private company, was not required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any issues with our integrated ERP system may cause time delays and impact our ability to undertake financial reporting in a timely manner.\nWe are subject to various governmental export control, trade sanctions, and import laws and regulations that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate these controls.\nIn some cases, our products are subject to U.S. and foreign export control laws and regulations that may limit where and to whom we are permitted to sell our products, including the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and our activities may be subject to trade and economic sanctions, including those administered by the United States Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (collectively, \u201cTrade Controls\u201d). As such, a license may be required to export or re-export our products, or provide related services, to certain countries and end-users, and for certain end-uses. Further, our products incorporating encryption functionality may be subject to special controls applying to encryption items and/or certain reporting requirements.\nWe have procedures in place designed to ensure our compliance with Trade Controls, with which failure to comply could subject us to both civil and criminal penalties, including substantial fines, possible incarceration\nof responsible individuals for willful violations, possible loss of our export or import privileges, and reputational harm. Further, the process for obtaining necessary licenses may be time-consuming or unsuccessful, potentially causing delays in sales or losses of sales opportunities. Trade Controls are complex and dynamic regimes, and monitoring and ensuring compliance can be challenging, particularly given that our products are widely distributed throughout the world and are available for download without registration. Although we have no knowledge that our activities have resulted in violations of Trade Controls, any failure by us or our partners to comply with applicable laws and regulations would have negative consequences for us, including reputational harm, government investigations, and penalties.\nIn addition, various countries regulate the import of certain technologies and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products and certain product features or could limit our customers\u2019 ability to implement our products in those countries. Changes in our products or changes in U.S. and foreign import and export regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or, in some cases, prevent the import and export of our products to certain countries altogether. For example, in 2018 and 2019, the United States imposed tariffs on a large variety of products originating from China, including some on components that are supplied to us from China. Depending upon the duration and implementation of these and future tariffs, as well as our ability to mitigate their impact, these tariffs could materially affect our business, including in the form of increased cost of goods sold, increased pricing for customers, and reduced sales. At this time, it remains unclear what additional actions, if any, will be taken by the governments of the United States or China with respect to such trade and tariff matters. Any change in import and export regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, persons or technologies impacted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Failure to comply with these and similar laws on a timely basis, or at all, or any limitation on our ability to develop, export or sell our products would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental regulations that could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to environmental rules and regulations or other social initiatives that impact how and where we manufacture our products. In particular, our manufacturing operations use substances that are regulated by various federal, state, local, foreign and international laws and regulations governing health, safety and the environment, including WEEE, RoHS and REACH regulations adopted by the E.U. From time to time, the E.U. restricts or considers restricting certain substances under these Directives. For example, indium phosphide is currently being considered for restriction under RoHS. Any restriction of indium phosphide or any other substance integral to our systems could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, if we experience a problem complying with these laws and regulations, it could cause an interruption or delay in our manufacturing operations or it could cause us to incur liabilities or costs related to health, safety or environmental remediation or compliance. We could also be subject to liability if we do not handle these substances in compliance with safety standards for handling, storage and transportation and applicable laws and regulations. If we experience a problem or fail to comply with such safety standards or laws and regulations, our business, financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\nWe are subject to global data privacy and data protection laws and regulations that could adversely affect our business or subject us to liability.\nData privacy and data protection is an area of increasing focus for our customers, governmental regulators and privacy advocates, and many jurisdictions, including the E.U., the United States, China and other regions, are evaluating or have implemented regulations relating to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection, which can affect the market and requirements for networking and communications equipment. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) in effect in the E.U., and similar regulatory standards in effect in the United Kingdom, the Personal Information Protection Law (\"PIPL\") in China, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) and the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), and enacted or proposed legislation in other jurisdictions have created new compliance obligations with respect to data handling and processing.\nWe cannot fully predict the impact of the GDPR, the PIPL, the CCPA, the CPRA or other laws or regulations, including those enacted in the future, relating to cybersecurity, privacy or data protection on our business or operations, These laws and regulations have required us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply, and we expect to continue to\nincur such costs and expenses in the future. Any failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in claims, litigation, and regulatory proceedings, as well as damage to our customer relationships. These could result in substantial costs, diversion of resources, fines, penalties, and other damages, and harm to our reputation. Any of these could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities, which are subject to a number of uncertainties, challenges, and risks.\nWe currently sell many of our solutions to various government entities, and we may in the future increase sales to government entities. Sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks. Selling to government entities can be highly competitive, expensive, and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will complete a sale. In the event that we are successful in being awarded a government contract, such award may be subject to appeals, disputes, or litigation, including, but not limited to, bid protests by unsuccessful bidders. Government demand and payment for our solutions may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our solutions. Government entities may also have statutory, contractual, or other legal rights to terminate contracts for convenience or due to a default. For purchases by the U.S. federal government, the government may require certain products to be manufactured in the United States and other high-cost manufacturing locations, and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet government requirements, and as a result, our business and results of operations may suffer. Contracts with governmental entities may also include preferential pricing terms, including, but not limited to, \u201cmost favored customer\u201d pricing.\nAdditionally, we may be required to obtain special certifications to sell some or all of our solutions to government or quasi-government entities. Such certification requirements for our solutions may change, thereby restricting our ability to sell into the federal government sector until we have attained the revised certification. If our products and subscriptions are late in achieving or fail to achieve compliance with these certifications and standards, or our competitors achieve compliance with these certifications and standards, we may be disqualified from selling our products to such governmental entities, or be at a competitive disadvantage, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. There are no assurances that we will find the terms for obtaining such certifications to be acceptable or that we will be successful in obtaining or maintaining the certifications.\nAs a government contractor or subcontractor, we must comply with laws, regulations, and contractual provisions relating to the formation, administration, and performance of government contracts and inclusion on government contract vehicles, which affect how we and our partners do business with government agencies. As a result of actual or perceived noncompliance with government contracting laws, regulations, or contractual provisions, we may be subject to non-ordinary course audits and internal investigations which may prove costly to our business financially, divert management time, or limit our ability to continue selling our products and services to our government customers. These laws and regulations may impose other added costs on our business, and failure to comply with these or other applicable regulations and requirements, including non-compliance in the past, could lead to claims for damages from our channel partners, downward contract price adjustments or refund obligations, civil or criminal penalties, and termination of contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting for a period of time with government agencies. Any such damages, penalties, disruption, or limitation in our ability to do business with a government would adversely impact, and could have a material adverse effect on, our business, financial condition, results of operations, public perception, and growth prospects.\nOur business could be adversely affected if our employees cannot obtain and maintain required security clearances or we cannot maintain a required facility security clearance, or we do not comply with legal and regulatory obligations regarding the safeguarding of classified information.\nOur U.S. government contract revenue includes income derived from contracts that require our employees to maintain various levels of security clearances, and may require us to maintain a facility security clearance, to comply with Department of Defense (\u201cDoD\u201d) requirements. The DoD has strict security clearance requirements for personnel who perform work in support of classified programs. In general, access to classified information, technology, facilities, or programs are subject to additional contract oversight and potential liability. In the event of a security incident involving classified information, technology, facilities, programs, or personnel holding clearances, we may be subject to legal, financial, operational, and reputational harm. We are limited in\nour ability to provide specific information about these classified programs, their risks, or any disputes or claims relating to such programs. As a result, investors have less insight into our classified programs than our other businesses and therefore less ability to fully evaluate the risks related to our classified business or our business overall. Obtaining and maintaining security clearances for employees involves a lengthy process, and it is difficult to identify, recruit, and retain employees who already hold security clearances. If our employees are unable to obtain security clearances in a timely manner, or at all, or if our employees who hold security clearances are unable to maintain their clearances or terminate employment with us, then a customer requiring classified work could terminate an existing contract or decide not to renew the contract upon its expiration. To the extent we are not able to obtain or maintain a facility security clearance, we may not be able to bid on or win new classified contracts, and existing contracts requiring a facility security clearance could be terminated.\nFailure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering laws, and similar laws, could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, and possibly other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the United States and in countries outside of the United States in which we conduct our activities. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies, their employees, agents, representatives, business partners, and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector.\nWe sometimes leverage third parties to sell our products and conduct our business abroad. We, our employees, agents, representatives, business partners our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these employees, agents, representatives, business partners or third-party intermediaries even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. We cannot assure you that all of our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. As we increase our international sales and business, our risks under these laws may increase.\nThese laws also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that none of our employees, agents, representatives, business partners or third-party intermediaries will take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible.\nAny allegations or violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, enforcement actions, fines, damages, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and prospects. Responding to any investigation or action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile and may be volatile in the future.\nThe trading prices of our common stock and the securities of other technology companies have been and may continue to be highly volatile. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include:\n\u2022variations in our operating results;\n\u2022announcements of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022the gain or loss of customers;\n\u2022recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022changes in the estimates of our future operating results or external guidance on those results or changes in recommendations or business expectations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u2022mergers and acquisitions by us, by our competitors or by our customers;\n\u2022market conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole, including global trade tariffs and fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates or inflation rates;\n\u2022social, geopolitical, environmental or health factors, including pandemics or widespread health epidemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022adoption or modification of regulations, policies, procedures or programs applicable to our business.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the broader stock market experience a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. Each of these factors, among others, could harm the value of your investment in our common stock. Some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities class action lawsuits filed against them. If a suit were filed against us, regardless of its merits or outcome, it could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nFuture sales of our common stock could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe have sold, and plan in the future to sell, shares of our common stock in underwritten offerings and have established, and may in the future establish, \u201cat-the-market\u201d offering programs pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock. Sales of securities have resulted and will continue to result in dilution of our existing stockholders, and such sales could cause our stock price to fall.\nIn addition, if our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intent to sell, a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market, it could cause our stock price to fall. We may also issue shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments or otherwise. Any such issuance would result in dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which apply to us, may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws:\n\u2022authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d convertible preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022establish a classified board of directors, as a result of which the successors to the directors whose terms have expired will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following their election;\n\u2022require that directors only be removed from office for cause;\n\u2022provide that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office rather than by stockholders;\n\u2022prevent stockholders from calling special meetings; and\n\u2022prohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America as the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which will restrict our stockholders\u2019 ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThese provisions would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. Our stockholders cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions.\nThese exclusive choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If a court were to find such exclusive-forum provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could harm our business.\nEvents that are outside our control, such as natural disasters, human violence or other catastrophic events, could harm our operations.\nOur headquarters and the majority of our infrastructure, including our PIC fabrication manufacturing facility, are located in Northern California, an area that is susceptible to earthquakes, fires, floods and other natural disasters. Further, attacks and violence aimed at Northern California or at the United States energy or telecommunications infrastructure could hinder or delay the development and sale of our products. In the event that an earthquake, targeted attack or other man-made or natural catastrophe were to destroy any part of our or our contract manufacturers\u2019 or suppliers' facilities, destroy or disrupt vital infrastructure systems, or interrupt our operations or supply chain for any extended period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.", "PERMNO": 92095, "SIC": 3576, "TIC": "INFN"}
