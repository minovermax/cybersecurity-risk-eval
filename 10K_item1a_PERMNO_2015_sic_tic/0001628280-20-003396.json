RISK FACTORS\nRISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves certain risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks that may have a material and adverse effect on the Company, and the risks described herein are not listed in order of the potential occurrence or severity. There is no assurance that we have identified, assessed and appropriately addressed all risks affecting our business operations. Additional risks and uncertainties could adversely affect our business and our results. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, and the market price for our shares could decline. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below are cautionary statements, identifying important factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. There can also be no assurance that the actual future results, performance, benefits or achievements that we expect from our strategies, systems, initiatives or products will occur.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nIf we lose key sending agents, our business with key sending agents is reduced or we are unable to maintain our sending agent network under terms consistent with those currently in place, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nMost of our revenue is earned through our sending agent network. Sending agents are the persons who generate our customers and provide them with our money remittance services. If sending agents decide to leave our network, our revenue and profits could be adversely affected. The loss of sending agents may occur for a number of reasons, including competition from other money remittance providers, a sending agent\u2019s dissatisfaction with its relationship with us or the revenue earned from the relationship, or a sending agent\u2019s unwillingness or inability to comply with our standards or legal requirements, including those related to compliance with anti-money laundering regulations, anti-fraud measures or agent monitoring. Sending agents also may generate fewer transactions or reduce locations for reasons unrelated to our relationship with them, including increased competition in their business, general economic conditions, regulatory costs or other reasons. In addition, we may not be able to maintain our sending agent network under terms consistent with those already in place. Larger sending agents may demand additional financial concessions, which could increase competitive pressure. The inability to maintain our sending agent contracts on terms consistent with those already in place could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face intense competition, and if we are unable to continue to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we face a variety of competitors across our businesses, some of which have larger and more established customer bases and substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. We compete in a concentrated industry, with a small number of large competitors such as Western Union, MoneyGram and Euronet and a large number of small, niche competitors, including consumer money remittance companies, banks, card associations, web-based services, payment processors, informal remittance systems and others. We believe our services are differentiated by features and functionalities, including trust, convenience, service, efficiency of outlets, value, technology and brand recognition. Distribution channels and digital platforms such as online, account based and mobile solutions continue to evolve and impact the competitive environment for money remittances.\nOur future growth depends on our ability to compete effectively. For example, if our services do not offer competitive features and functionalities, we may lose customers to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we fail to price our services appropriately relative to our competitors, consumers may not use our services, which could adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, transaction volume where we face intense competition could be adversely affected by increasing pricing pressures between our money remittance services and those of some of our competitors, which could reduce margins and adversely affect our financial results. We have historically implemented and may continue implementing price adjustments from time to time in response to competition and other factors. If we reduce prices in order to mitigate the actions of competitors, such reductions could adversely affect our financial results in the short term and may also adversely affect our financial results in the long term if transaction volumes do not increase sufficiently or we do not implement other pricing strategies.\nIf customer confidence in our business or in consumer money remittance providers generally deteriorates, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business is built on customer confidence in our brand and our ability to provide convenient, reliable and value-added money remittance services. Erosion in customer confidence in our business, or in consumer money remittance service providers as a means to\nIndex\ntransfer money more generally, could adversely impact transaction volumes which would in turn adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA number of factors could adversely affect customer confidence in our business, or in consumer money remittance providers more generally, many of which are beyond our control, and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These factors include:\n\u2022the quality of our services and our customer experience, and our ability to meet evolving customer needs and preferences;\n\u2022failure of our agents to deliver services in accordance with our requirements;\n\u2022reputational concerns resulting from actual or perceived events, including those related to fraud, consumer protection, money laundering, corruption or other matters;\n\u2022changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations, or regulator or judicial interpretation thereof, that have the effect of making it more difficult or less desirable to transfer money using consumer money remittance service providers, including additional customer due diligence, identification, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements;\n\u2022actions by federal, state or foreign regulators that interfere with our ability to remit customers\u2019 money reliably; for example, attempts to seize money remittance funds, imposition of tariffs or limits on our ability to, or that prohibit us from, remitting money in the corridors in which we operate;\n\u2022federal, state or foreign legal requirements, including those that require us to provide customer or transaction data, and other requirements or to a greater extent than is currently required;\n\u2022any interruption or downtime in our systems, including those caused by fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorism, vendor failure, unauthorized entry and computer viruses or disruptions in our workforce; and\n\u2022any attack or breach of our computer systems or other data storage facilities resulting in a compromise of personal data.\nA significant portion of our customers are migrants. Consumer advocacy groups or governmental agencies could consider migrants to be disadvantaged and entitled to protection, enhanced consumer disclosure, or other different treatment. If consumer advocacy groups are able to generate widespread support for actions that are detrimental to our business, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur profit margins may be adversely affected by expansion into new geographic or product markets, which we may enter by acquisition or otherwise, that do not have the same profitability as our core markets.\nAlthough expansion of our business into new geographic or product markets may increase our aggregate revenues, such new geographic or product markets may be more expensive to operate in and may require us to receive lower payment per wire or remittance than that which we currently experience in our core geographic markets of Mexico and Guatemala or other more established product markets due to, among other things:\n\u2022increased compliance and regulatory costs in a particular geographic or product area requiring us to dedicate more expense, time and resources to comply with such regulatory requirements;\n\u2022potentially higher operational expenses in a particular geographic or product area, such as higher agent fees, taxes, fees, technology costs, support costs or other charges and expense associated with engaging in the money transfer business in such jurisdictions or as a result of such product offerings;\n\u2022cost and reduced pricing models due to more intense competition in a particular geographic or product area with competitors that may have more experience and resources as well as more established relationships with relevant customers, regulators and industry participants in the particular geographic or product area;\n\u2022potentially reduced demand for remittance services in a particular geographic or product area; and\n\u2022difficulty building and maintaining a network of sending and paying agents in a particular geographic area or with respect to a particular product offering.\nDuring 2019, we expanded our services to allow remittances to Africa from the United States and also began offering sending services from Canada to Latin America and Africa. Additionally, we have expanded our product and service portfolio to include online payment\nIndex\noptions, pre-paid debit cards and direct deposit payroll cards, which may present different cost, demand, regulatory and risk profiles relative to our core remittance business. If we are unable to capitalize on these markets, or if we spend significant time and resources on expansion plans that fail or are delayed, our business will be adversely affected. Even if we are successful, we will be exposed to additional risks in these markets that we do not face in the United States or in our core remittance business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrent and proposed data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to requirements relating to data privacy and cybersecurity under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws. For example, in the U.S. the FTC routinely investigates the privacy practices of companies and has commenced enforcement actions against many, resulting in multi-million dollar settlements and multi-year agreements governing the settling companies\u2019 privacy practices. If we are unable to meet such requirements, we may be subject to significant fines or penalties. Furthermore, certain industry groups require us to adhere to privacy requirements in addition to federal, state and foreign laws, and certain of our business relationships depend upon our compliance with these requirements.\nAs the number of jurisdictions enacting privacy and related laws increases and the scope of these laws and enforcement efforts expands, we will increasingly become subject to new and varying requirements. For example, in June 2018, California enacted the CCPA, which became effective in January 2020. The CCPA will require covered companies to provide California consumers with new disclosures and will expand the rights afforded to consumers regarding their data. The CCPA is subject to proposed amendments, and accordingly, we cannot yet predict its potential impact on our business or operations. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the CCPA and similar laws may limit the use and adoption of our products and services and/or require us to incur substantial compliance costs, which could have an adverse impact on our business. Failure to comply with existing or future data privacy and cybersecurity laws, regulations and requirements, including by reason of inadvertent disclosure of personal information, could result in significant adverse consequences, including reputational harm, civil litigation, regulatory enforcement, costs of remediation, increased expenses for security systems and personnel, harm to our consumers and harm to our agents. These consequences could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, in connection with regulatory requirements to assist in the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing and pursuant to legal obligations and authorizations, we make information available to certain U.S. federal and state, as well as certain foreign, government agencies. In recent years, we have experienced increasing data sharing requests by these agencies, particularly in connection with efforts to prevent terrorist financing or reduce the risk of identity theft. During the same period, there has also been increased public attention to the corporate use and disclosure of personal information, accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer privacy. These regulatory goals may conflict, and the law in these areas is not consistent or settled. While we believe that we are compliant with our regulatory responsibilities, the legal, political and business environments in these areas are rapidly changing, and subsequent legislation, regulation, litigation, court rulings or other events could expose us to increased program costs, liability and reputational damage that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur current risk management and compliance systems may not be able to exhaustively assess or mitigate all risks to which we are exposed from a transaction monitoring perspective, which could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are engaged in ongoing efforts to enhance our risk management and compliance policies, procedures and systems to assure compliance with anti-money laundering laws and economic sanctions regulations. We have implemented, and are continuing to implement, policies, procedures and systems designed to address these laws and regulations, including monitoring on an automated and manual basis, the transactions processed through our systems and restricting business involving certain countries. However, the implementation of such policies, procedures and systems may be subject to human error. Further, we may be exposed to fraud or other misconduct committed by our employees, or other third parties, including but not limited to our customers and agents, or other events that are out of our control. Additionally, our risk management policies, procedures and systems are based upon our experience in the industry, and may not be adequate or effective in managing our future risk exposures or protecting us against unidentified or unanticipated risks, which could be significantly greater than those indicated by our past experience. As a result, despite our efforts to improve the aforementioned policies, procedures and systems, we can offer no assurances that these policies, procedures and systems will be adequate to detect or prevent money laundering activity or OFAC violations. If any of these policies, procedures or systems do not operate properly, or are disabled, or are subject to intentional manipulation or inadvertent human error, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our business, regulatory intervention or reputational damage.\nOur services might be used for illegal or improper purposes, such as consumer fraud or money laundering, which could expose us to additional liability and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur services remain susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses as criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving internet services and payment services, such as identity theft, fraud and paper instrument\nIndex\ncounterfeiting. As we make more of our services available online and via Internet-enabled mobile devices, we subject ourselves to new types of consumer fraud risk because requirements relating to consumer authentication are more complex with internet services and such other technologies. Additionally, it is possible that our agents could engage in fraud against consumers. We use a variety of tools to protect against fraud; however, these tools may not always be successful. Allegations of fraud may result in fines, settlements, litigation expenses and reputational damage.\nThe industry is under increasing scrutiny from federal, state and local regulators in connection with the potential for consumer fraud. If consumer fraud levels involving our services were to rise, it could lead to regulatory intervention and reputational and financial damage, as well as the risk of government enforcement actions and investigations, reduced use and acceptance of our services or increased compliance costs, causing a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOther illegal or improper uses of our services may include money laundering, terrorist financing, drug trafficking, human trafficking, illegal online gaming, romance and other online scams, illegal sexually-oriented services, prohibited sales of pharmaceuticals, fraudulent sale of goods or services, piracy of software, movies, music and other copyrighted or trademarked goods, unauthorized uses of credit and debit cards or bank accounts and similar misconduct. Users of our services also may encourage, promote, facilitate or instruct others to engage in illegal activities. If the measures we have taken are too restrictive and inadvertently screen proper transactions, this could diminish our customer experience which could harm our business. Despite measures we have taken to detect and lessen the risk of this kind of conduct, there is no assurance that these measures will stop all illegal or improper uses of our services. Our business could be harmed if customers use our system for illegal or improper purposes.\nA breach of security in the systems on which we rely could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on a variety of technologies to provide security for our systems. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments, including improper acts by third parties, may result in a compromise or breach of the security measures we use to protect our systems. We obtain, transmit and store confidential consumer, employer and agent information in connection with some of our services. These activities are subject to laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. The requirements imposed by these laws and regulations, which often differ materially among the many jurisdictions, are designed to protect the privacy of personal information and to prevent that information from being inappropriately disclosed. Any security breaches in our computer networks, databases or facilities could lead to the inappropriate use or disclosure of personal information, which could harm our business and reputation, adversely affect consumers\u2019 confidence in our or our agents\u2019 business, result in inquiries and fines or penalties from regulatory or governmental authorities, cause a loss of consumers, damage our reputation and subject us to lawsuits and subject us to potential financial losses. In addition, we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches. Our agents and third-party independent contractors may also experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of our data as well as the ability to initiate unauthorized transactions. If users gain improper access to our, our agents\u2019 or our third-party independent contractors\u2019 computer networks or databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify confidential customer information or generate unauthorized money remittances. Such a breach could expose us to monetary liability, losses and legal proceedings, lead to reputational harm, cause a disruption in our operations, or make our consumers and agents less confident in our services, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is particularly dependent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our information technology, computer network systems and data centers. Disruptions to these systems and data centers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to provide reliable services largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer network systems and data centers. Our business involves the movement of large sums of money and the management of data necessary to do so. The success of our business particularly depends upon the efficient and error-free handling of transactions and data. We rely on the ability of our employees and our internal systems and processes to process these transactions in an efficient, uninterrupted and error-free manner.\nIn the event of a breakdown, catastrophic event (such as fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure or physical break-in), security breach, computer virus, improper operation, improper action by our employees, agents, consumers, financial institutions or third-party vendors or any other event impacting our systems or processes or our agents\u2019 or vendors\u2019 systems or processes, we could suffer financial loss, loss of consumers, regulatory sanctions, lawsuits and damage to our reputation or consumers\u2019 confidence in our business. The measures we have enacted, such as the implementation of disaster recovery plans and redundant computer systems, may not be successful. We may also experience problems other than system failures, including software defects, development delays and installation difficulties, which would harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability and increased operating expenses. In addition, any work stoppages or other labor actions by employees who support our systems or perform any of our major functions could adversely affect our business.\nIndex\nIn addition, our ability to continue to provide our services to a growing number of agents and consumers in a growing number of countries, as well as to enhance our existing services and offer new services across new distribution platforms, is dependent on our information technology systems. If we are unable to effectively manage the technology associated with our business, we could experience increased costs, reductions in system availability and loss of agents or consumers. Any failure of our systems in scalability, reliability and functionality could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWeakness in economic conditions, in both the U.S. and international markets, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to business cycles and other outside factors that may negatively affect our business.\nOur money remittance business relies in part on the overall strength of economic conditions as well as international migration patterns. Consumer money remittance transactions and international migration patterns are affected by, among other things, employment opportunities and overall economic conditions. Additionally, consumers tend to be employed in industries such as construction, information, manufacturing, agriculture and certain service industries that tend to be cyclical and more significantly impacted by weak economic conditions than other industries. This may result in reduced job opportunities for our customers in the United States or other countries that are important to our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, increases in employment opportunities may lag other elements of any economic recovery.\nIf general market conditions in the United States or international economies important to our business were to deteriorate, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. Our sending agents and paying agents may have reduced sales or business as a result of weak economic conditions. As a result, our agents may reduce their number of locations, hours of operation, or cease doing business altogether. If our consumer transactions decline or international migration patterns shift due to deteriorating economic conditions, we may be unable to timely and effectively reduce our operating costs or take other actions in response, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, economic or political instability, wars, civil unrest, terrorism and natural disasters may make money transfers to, from or within a particular country more difficult. The inability to timely complete money transfers could adversely affect our business.\nWhile we do not experience meaningful seasonality, we do experience increased transaction volume around certain holidays, such as Mother\u2019s Day and the December holidays. As a result, our quarterly operating results may fluctuate which could lead to volatility in the price of our shares.\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected by public health crises such as the recent coronavirus outbreak.\nMarket and economic disruptions may occur in response to public health epidemics like the coronavirus currently affecting the global community. The rapid spread of coronavirus, or fear of such an event, can have a material adverse effect on the demand for our money remittance services to the extent it impacts the markets in which we operate. If our customers are adversely affected, or if the virus leads to a widespread health emergency that impacts economic growth generally, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Moreover, our operations and productivity could be negatively affected if our employees or agents are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain at this time and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others.\nA significant change or disruption in international migration patterns could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business relies in part on international migration patterns, as individuals move from their native countries to countries with greater economic opportunities or a more stable political environment. A significant portion of the industry\u2019s money remittance transactions are initiated by immigrants or refugees sending money back to their native countries. Changes in immigration laws that discourage international migration and political or other events (such as war, terrorism or health emergencies) that make it more difficult for individuals to migrate or work abroad could adversely affect our money remittance volume or growth rate. Sustained weakness in global economic conditions could reduce economic opportunities for migrant workers and result in reduced or disrupted international migration patterns. Reduced or disrupted international migration patterns in the United States, Canada, Latin America, or Africa are likely to reduce money remittance transaction volumes and therefore have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, significant changes in international migration patterns could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant developments stemming from the U.S. administration could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur business relies on the free flow of funds and migrants along our remittance corridors, including between the United States and Mexico and Guatemala. Changes in U.S. political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing immigration, foreign\nIndex\ntrade, development and investment in the territories and countries where we operate and our customers live could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to successfully develop and timely introduce new and enhanced services or if we make substantial investments in an unsuccessful new service or infrastructure change, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur future growth will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced methods of providing money remittance services that keep pace with competitive introductions, technological changes, and the demands and preferences of our agents, consumers and the financial institutions with which we conduct our business. Distribution channels such as online, account based, and mobile solutions continue to evolve and impact the competitive environment for money remittance. If alternative payment mechanisms become widely accepted as substitutes for our current services, and we do not develop and offer similar alternative payment mechanisms successfully and on a timely basis, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We may make future acquisitions and investments or enter into strategic alliances to develop new technologies and services or to implement infrastructure changes to further our strategic objectives, strengthen our existing businesses and remain competitive. Such acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, however, are inherently risky, and we cannot guarantee that such investments or strategic alliances will be successful. If such acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances are not successful, they could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn inability by us or our agents, or both, to maintain adequate banking relationships may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe buy and sell a number of global currencies and maintain a network of settlement accounts to facilitate the timely funding of money remittances and foreign exchange trades. Our relationships with clearing, check processing, trading and exchange rate and cash management banks are critical to an efficient and reliable remittance network. An inability on our part to maintain existing or establish new banking relationships sufficient to enable us to conduct our business could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish and maintain adequate banking relationships.\nIf we cannot maintain sufficient relationships with large U.S. and international banks that provide these services, we would be required to implement alternative cash management procedures, which may result in increased costs. Relying on local banks in each country could alter the complexity of our treasury operations, degrade the level of automation, visibility and service we currently receive from banks and affect patterns of settlement with our agents. This could result in an increase in operating costs and an increase in the amount of time it takes to concentrate agent remittances and to deliver agent payables, potentially adversely impacting our cash flow, working capital needs and exposure to local currency value fluctuations.\nA significant percentage of our banking relationships are concentrated in a few banks and if we lose one such relationship, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nA substantial portion of the transactions that we conduct with and through banks are concentrated in a few banks, notably Wells Fargo, Bank of America and US Bank. Because of the current concentration of our major banking relationships, if we lose such a banking relationship, which could be the result of many factors including, but not limited to, changes in regulation, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nA significant portion of our paying agents are concentrated in a few large banks and financial institutions or large retail chains and if we lose such a paying agent, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nA substantial portion of our paying agents are concentrated in a few large banks and financial institutions and large retail chains. Because of the current concentration of our paying agents in a few institutions, if we lose such an institution as a paying agent, which could be the result of many factors including, but not limited to, changes in regulation, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Elektra, our largest paying agent by volume, accounted for approximately 18% of Intermex\u2019s total remittance volume in fiscal year 2019. The loss of Elektra as one of our paying agents could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nMajor bank failure or sustained financial market illiquidity, or illiquidity at our clearing, cash management and custodial financial institutions, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face certain risks in the event of a sustained deterioration of domestic or international financial market liquidity, as well as in the event of sustained deterioration in the liquidity, or failure, of our clearing, cash management and custodial financial institutions. In particular:\nIndex\n\u2022We may be unable to access funds in our deposit accounts and clearing accounts on a timely basis to pay money remittances and make related settlements to agents. Any resulting need to access other sources of liquidity or short-term borrowing would increase our costs. Any delay or inability to pay money remittances or make related settlements with our agents could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022In the event of a major bank failure, we could face major risks to the recovery of our bank deposits used for the purpose of settling with our agents. A substantial portion of our cash and cash equivalents are either held at U.S. banks that are not subject to federal deposit insurance protection against loss or exceed the federal deposit insurance limit. Similarly, we hold cash and cash equivalents at foreign banks, which may not enjoy benefits such as the United States\u2019 federal deposit insurance protection.\n\u2022We may be unable to borrow from financial institutions or institutional investors on favorable terms, or at all, which could adversely impact our ability to pursue our growth strategy and fund key strategic initiatives.\nIf financial liquidity deteriorates, there can be no assurance we will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access capital and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and our sending agents are considered MSBs in the United States under the BSA.\nU.S. regulators are increasingly taking the position that MSBs under the BSA, as a class, are high risk businesses. In addition, the creation of anti-money laundering laws has created concern and awareness among banks of the negative implications of aiding and abetting money laundering activity. As a result, banks may choose not to provide banking services to MSBs in certain regions due to the risk of additional regulatory scrutiny and the cost of building and maintaining additional compliance functions. Further, certain foreign banks have been forced by U.S. correspondent banks to terminate relationships with MSBs. As a result, we have been denied access to retail banking services in certain markets by banks that have sought to reduce their exposure to MSBs and not as a result of any concern related to our compliance programs. If we or our agents are unable to obtain sufficient banking relationships, we or they may not be able to offer our services in a particular region, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in banking industry regulation and practice could make it more difficult for us and our sending agents to maintain depository accounts with banks, which would harm our business.\nThe banking industry, in light of increased regulatory oversight, is continually examining its business relationships with companies that offer money remittance services and with retail agents that collect and remit cash collected from end consumers. Certain major national and international banks have withdrawn from providing service to money remittance services businesses. Should our existing relationship banks decide to not offer depository services to companies engaged in processing money remittance transactions, or to retail agents that collect and remit cash from end customers, our ability to complete money remittances, and to administer and collect fees from money remittance transactions, could be adversely impacted.\nOur regulatory status and the regulatory status of our agents could affect our ability to offer our services. We also rely on bank accounts to provide our payment services. We and our agents are considered MSBs under the BSA, and many banks view MSBs, as a class, as higher risk customers for purposes of their anti-money laundering programs. We and some of our agents may in the future have difficulty establishing or maintaining banking relationships due to the banks' policies, including policies with respect to anti-money laundering. If we or a significant number of our agents are unable to maintain existing or establish new banking relationships, or if we or these agents face higher fees and other costs to maintain or establish new bank accounts, our ability and the ability of our agents to continue to offer our services may be adversely impacted, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe face credit risks from our sending agents and financial institutions with which we do business.\nThe majority of our business is conducted through independent sending agents that provide our services to consumers at their business locations. Our sending agents receive the proceeds from the sale of our money remittances, and we must then collect these funds from the sending agents. If a sending agent becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, commits fraud or otherwise fails to remit money remittance proceeds to us, we must nonetheless complete the money remittance on behalf of the consumer.\nMoreover, we have made, and may make in the future, secured or unsecured loans to sending agents under limited circumstances or allow sending agents to retain our funds for a period of time before remitting them to us. As of December 31, 2019, we had credit exposure in loans to our sending agents of $1.3 million in the aggregate.\nWe monitor the creditworthiness of our sending agents and the financial institutions with which we do business on an ongoing basis. There can be no assurance that the models and approaches we use to assess and monitor the creditworthiness of our sending agents and these financial institutions will be sufficiently predictive, and we may be unable to detect and take steps to timely mitigate an increased credit risk.\nIndex\nIn the event of a sending agent bankruptcy, we would generally be in the position of creditor, possibly with limited security or financial guarantees of performance, and we would therefore be at risk of a reduced recovery. We are not insured against credit losses, except in circumstances of agent theft or fraud. Significant credit losses could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.\nThe Company may identify material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting. While all such identified material weaknesses and significant deficiencies could be remediated, there can be no assurance that the Company will not identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in its internal control in the future. Moreover, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. The existence of a material weakness or significant deficiency could result in errors in the Company's financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, which could cause the Company to fail to meet its reporting obligations, lead to a loss of investor confidence and have a negative impact on the trading price of the Company's common stock.\nRetaining our chief executive officer and other key executives and finding and retaining qualified personnel is important to our continued success, and any inability to attract and retain such personnel could harm our operations.\nOur ability to successfully operate our business will depend upon the efforts of certain key personnel. The development and implementation of our strategy has depended in large part on our Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Robert Lisy. The retention of Mr. Lisy is important to our continued success, and we expect him to remain with the Company for the foreseeable future.\nIn addition to Mr. Lisy, we have a number of key executives who have a significant impact on our business. Although we expect all of such key personnel will continue to remain with the Company, the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect the operations and profitability of the Company. Our success also depends to a large extent upon our ability to attract and retain key employees. Qualified individuals with experience in our industry are in high demand. Our IT personnel have designed and implemented key portions of our proprietary software and are crucial to the success of our business. In addition, legal or enforcement actions against compliance and other personnel in the money remittance industry may affect our ability to attract and retain key employees and directors. The lack of management continuity or the loss of one or more members of our executive management team could harm our business and future development. A failure to attract and retain key personnel including operating, marketing, financial and technical personnel, could also have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and our agents are subject to numerous U.S. and international laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in material settlements, fines or penalties and reputational harm, and changes in these laws or regulations could result in increased operating costs or reduced demand for our services, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment, and our business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. We are also subject to oversight by various governmental agencies, both in the United States and abroad. Lawmakers and regulators in the United States in particular have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry. New or modified regulations and increased oversight may have unforeseen or unintended adverse effects on the financial services industry, which could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe money transfer business is subject to a variety of regulations aimed at preventing money laundering and terrorism. We are subject to U.S. federal anti-money laundering laws, including the BSA and the requirements of the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s OFAC, which prohibit us from transmitting money to specified countries or to or from prohibited individuals. Additionally, we are subject to anti-money laundering laws in the other countries in which we operate. We are also subject to financial services regulations, money transfer licensing regulations, consumer protection laws, currency control regulations, escheat laws, privacy and data protection laws and anti-bribery laws. Many of these laws are constantly evolving, unclear and inconsistent across various jurisdictions, making compliance challenging. Subsequent legislation, regulation, litigation, court rulings or other events could expose us to increased program costs, liability and reputational damage.\nWe are considered a MSB in the United States under the BSA, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. As such, we are subject to reporting, recordkeeping and anti-money laundering provisions in the United States as well as many other jurisdictions. In the past few years there have been significant regulatory reviews and actions taken by U.S. and other regulators and law enforcement agencies against banks, MSBs and other financial institutions related to money laundering, and the trend appears to be greater scrutiny by regulators of potential money laundering activity through financial institutions. We are also subject to regulatory oversight and enforcement by the\nIndex\nU.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\u201cFinCEN\u201d). Any determination that we have violated the anti-money-laundering laws could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act increases the regulation and oversight of the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act addresses, among other things, systemic risk, capital adequacy, deposit insurance assessments, consumer financial protection, interchange fees, derivatives, lending limits, thrift charters and changes among the bank regulatory agencies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires enforcement by various governmental agencies, including the CFPB. Money transmitters such as us are subject to direct supervision by the CFPB and are required to provide additional consumer information and disclosures, adopt error resolution standards and adjust refund procedures for international transactions originating in the United States in a manner consistent with the Remittance Transfer Rule (a rule issued by the CFPB pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act). In addition, the CFPB may adopt other regulations governing consumer financial services, including regulations defining unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices, and new model disclosures. We could be subject to fines or other penalties if we are found to have violated the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s prohibition against unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices. The CFPB\u2019s authority to change regulations adopted in the past by other regulators could increase our compliance costs and litigation exposure. Our litigation exposure may also be increased by the CFPB\u2019s authority to limit or ban pre-dispute arbitration clauses. We may also be liable for failure of our agents to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act. The legislation and implementation of regulations associated with the Dodd-Frank Act have increased our costs of compliance and required changes in the way we and our agents conduct business. In addition, we are subject to periodic examination by the CFPB. These examinations may require us to change the way we conduct business or increase the costs of compliance.\nThe United States and other countries periodically consider initiatives designed to lower costs of international remittances which, if implemented, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we are subject to escheatment laws in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. The concept of escheatment involves the reporting and delivery of property to states that is abandoned when its rightful owner cannot be readily located and/or identified. We are subject to the laws of various states in the United States which from time to time take inconsistent or conflicting positions regarding the requirements to escheat property to a particular state, making compliance challenging. In some instances, we escheat items to states pursuant to statutory requirements and then subsequently pay those items to consumers. For such amounts, we must file claims for reimbursement from the states.\nAny violation by us of the laws and regulations set forth above could lead to significant settlements, fines or penalties and could limit our ability to conduct business in some jurisdictions. Our systems, employees and processes may not be sufficient to detect and prevent violations of the laws and regulations set forth above by our agents, which could also lead to us being subject to significant settlements, fines or penalties. In addition to these fines and penalties, a failure by us or our agents to comply with applicable laws and regulations also could seriously damage our reputation, result in diminished revenue and profit and increase our operating costs and could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses or registrations, loss of approved status, termination of contracts with banks or retail representatives, administrative enforcement actions and fines, class action lawsuits, cease and desist or consent orders and civil and criminal liability. The occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn certain cases, regulations may provide administrative discretion regarding enforcement. As a result, regulations may be applied inconsistently across the industry, which could result in additional costs for us that may not be required to be incurred by our competitors. If we were required to maintain a price higher than most of our competitors to reflect our regulatory costs, this could harm our ability to compete effectively, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes in laws, regulations or other industry practices and standards, or interpretations of legal or regulatory requirements, may reduce the market for or value of our services or render our services less profitable or obsolete. Changes in the laws affecting the kinds of entities that are permitted to act as money remittance agents (such as changes in requirements for capitalization or ownership) could adversely affect our ability to distribute our services and the cost of providing such services. Many of our sending agents are in the check cashing industry. Any regulatory action that negatively impacts check cashers could also cause this portion of our agent base to decline. If onerous regulatory requirements were imposed on our agents, the requirements could lead to a loss of agents, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRegulators around the world compare approaches to the regulation of the payments and other industries. Consequently, a development in any one country, state or region may influence regulatory approaches in other jurisdictions. Similarly, new laws and regulations in a country, state or region involving one service may cause lawmakers there to extend the regulations to another service. As a result, the risks created by any new laws or regulations are magnified by the potential that they may be replicated, affecting our business in another market or involving another service. Conversely, if widely varying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may have difficulty adjusting our services, fees, foreign exchange spreads and other important aspects of our business, with the same effect. Either of these eventualities could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIndex\nRegulatory initiatives and changes in laws, regulations and industry practices and standards affecting us, our agents, or the banks with which we or our agents maintain accounts needed to provide our services could require changes to our business model and increase our costs of operations, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nOur agents are subject to a variety of regulatory requirements, which differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are subject to change. Material changes in the regulatory requirements for offering money transfer services, including with respect to anti-money laundering requirements, fraud prevention, licensing requirements, consumer protection, customer due diligence, agent registration, or increased requirements to monitor our agents in a jurisdiction important to our business have meant and could continue to mean increased costs and/or operational demands on our agents, which have resulted and could continue to result in their attrition, a decrease in the number of locations at which money transfer services are offered, an increase in the commissions paid to agents to compensate for their increased costs, and other negative consequences.\nOur fees, profit margins and/or foreign exchange spreads may be reduced or limited because of regulatory initiatives and changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation and industry practices and standards that are either industry wide or specifically targeted at our Company.\nThe evolving regulatory environment, including increased fees or taxes, regulatory initiatives, and changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation, industry practices and standards imposed by state, federal or foreign governments and expectations regarding our compliance efforts, is impacting the manner in which we operate our business, may change the competitive landscape and may adversely affect our financial results. Recently proposed and enacted legislation related to financial services providers and consumer protection in various jurisdictions around the world and at the federal and state level in the United States has subjected and may continue to subject us to additional regulatory oversight, mandate additional consumer disclosures and remedies, including refunds to consumers, or otherwise impact the manner in which we provide our services. If governments implement new laws or regulations that limit our right to set fees and/or foreign exchange spreads, then our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, changes in regulatory expectations, interpretations or practices could increase the risk of regulatory enforcement actions, fines and penalties.\nIn addition, policy makers may seek heightened customer due diligence requirements on, or restrict, remittances from the United States to Mexico. Policy makers have also discussed potential legislation to add taxes to remittances from the United States to Mexico and/or other countries. Further, one state has passed a law imposing a fee on certain money transfer transactions, and certain other states have proposed similar legislation. Several foreign countries have enacted or proposed rules imposing taxes or fees on certain money transfer transactions, as well. The approach of policy makers, the ongoing budget shortfalls in many jurisdictions, combined with future federal action or inaction on immigration reform, may lead other states or localities to impose similar taxes or fees, or other requirements or restrictions. Foreign countries in similar circumstances have invoked and could continue to invoke the imposition of sales, service or similar taxes, or other requirements or restrictions, on money transfer services. A tax, fee, or other requirement or restriction exclusively on money transfer services like us could put us at a competitive disadvantage to other means of remittance which are not subject to the same taxes, fees, requirements or restrictions. Other examples of changes to our financial environment include the possibility of regulatory initiatives that focus on lowering international remittance costs. Such initiatives may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nLitigation or investigations involving us or our agents could result in material settlements, fines or penalties and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have been, and in the future may be, subject to allegations and complaints that individuals or entities have used our money remittance services for fraud-induced money transfers, as well as certain money laundering activities, which may result in fines, penalties, judgments, settlements and litigation expenses. We also are the subject from time to time of litigation related to our business.\nRegulatory and judicial proceedings and potential adverse developments in connection with ongoing litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. There also may be adverse publicity associated with lawsuits and investigations that could decrease agent and consumer acceptance of our services. Additionally, our business has been in the past, and may be in the future, the subject of class action lawsuits, regulatory actions and investigations and other general litigation. The outcome of class action lawsuits, regulatory actions and investigations and other litigation is difficult to assess or quantify but may include substantial fines and expenses, as well as the revocation of required licenses or registrations or the loss of approved status, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations or consumers\u2019 confidence in our business. Plaintiffs or regulatory agencies in these lawsuits, actions or investigations may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of these actions may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend or settle future lawsuits or investigations may be significant. In addition, improper activities, lawsuits or investigations involving our agents may adversely impact our business operations or reputation even if we are not directly involved.\nIndex\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar anti-corruption laws.\nOur operations around the world, particularly in LAC countries and Africa are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the U.S. FCPA. The FCPA and similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or employees of commercial enterprises for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, a business advantage or a governmental approval. We operate in parts of the world that are perceived as having higher incidence of corruption and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Because of the scope and nature of our operations, we experience a higher risk associated with compliance with the FCPA and similar anti-corruption laws than many other companies.\nOur employees and agents interact with government officials on our behalf, including as necessary to obtain licenses and other regulatory approvals necessary to operate our business, employ expatriates and resolve tax disputes. We also have a number of contracts with third-party paying agents that are owned or controlled by non-U.S. governments. These interactions and contracts create a risk of payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of the FCPA or other similar anti-corruption laws. Under the FCPA and other similar anti-corruption laws, we may be held liable for actions taken by our employees or agents.\nIn recent years, there have been significant regulatory reviews and actions taken by the United States and other governments related to anti-corruption laws, and the trend appears to be greater scrutiny on payments to, and relationships with, foreign entities and individuals.\nAlthough we have implemented policies and procedures reasonably designed to promote compliance with local laws and regulations as well as U.S. laws and regulations, including the FCPA and similar anti-corruption laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees and agents will abide by our policies. If we are found to be liable for violations of the FCPA or similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions, either due to our own or others\u2019 acts or inadvertence, we could suffer, among other consequences, substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines, incarceration, prohibitions or limitations on the conduct of our business, the loss of our financing facilities and significant reputational damage, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of business, financial condition or results of operations.\nGovernment or regulatory investigations into potential violations of the FCPA or other similar anti-corruption laws by U.S. agencies or other governments could also have a material and adverse effect on our results of business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of the FCPA and other similar anti-corruption laws is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management.\nWe conduct money remittance transactions through agents in regions that are politically volatile or, in a limited number of cases, may be subject to certain OFAC restrictions.\nWe conduct money remittance transactions through agents in regions that are politically volatile or, in a limited number of cases, may be subject to certain OFAC restrictions. It is possible that our money remittance services or other services could be used in contravention of applicable law or regulations. Such circumstances could result in increased compliance costs, regulatory inquiries, suspension or revocation of required licenses or registrations, seizure or forfeiture of assets and the imposition of civil and criminal fines and penalties. In addition to monetary fines or penalties that we could incur, we could be subject to reputational harm that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew business initiatives, such as modifications to our current product offerings or the introduction of new products, may modify our risk profile from a regulatory perspective.\nA number of our recent and planned business initiatives and expansions of existing businesses may bring us into contact, directly or indirectly, with information, individuals and entities that are not within our traditional customer and agent network and that could expose us to new or enhanced regulatory scrutiny. For example, we are starting to offer services across new distribution platforms, which could expose us to increased anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financing and consumer protection regulations and compliance requirements. Any change in our risk profile stemming from this or any of our other business initiatives could result in increased compliance costs and litigation exposure, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws and unfavorable outcomes of tax positions we take could adversely affect our tax expense, liquidity, business and financial condition.\nWe file tax returns and take positions with respect to federal, state, local and international taxation, and our tax returns and tax positions are subject to review and audit by taxing authorities. An unfavorable outcome in a tax review or audit could result in higher tax expense, including interest and penalties, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. We establish reserves for material known tax exposures; however, there can be no assurance that an actual taxation event would not exceed our reserves.\nIndex\nOur business and results of operations may be adversely affected by foreign political, economic and social instability risks, foreign currency restrictions and devaluation, and various local laws associated with doing business in LAC countries and Africa.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from our money remittance transactions from the United States to the LAC corridor, particularly Mexico and Guatemala, and we are exposed to certain political, economic and other uncertainties not encountered in U.S. operations, including increased risks of social unrest, strikes, drug cartel and gang-related violence, war, kidnapping of employees or agents, nationalization, forced negotiation or modification of contracts, difficulty resolving disputes and enforcing contract provisions, expropriation of assets, taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions and restrictions on repatriation of income and capital, currency rate fluctuations, increased governmental ownership and regulation of the economy and markets in which we operate, and restrictive governmental regulation, bureaucratic delays, uncertain application of laws and regulations and general hazards associated with foreign sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted. LAC countries, in particular, have historically experienced uneven periods of economic growth, as well as recession, periods of high inflation and general economic and political instability. Additionally, as events in the LAC region have demonstrated, negative economic or political developments in one country in the region can lead to or exacerbate economic or political instability elsewhere in the region. Consequently, actions or events in LAC countries that are beyond our control could restrict our ability to operate there or otherwise adversely affect the profitability of those operations. Furthermore, changes in the business, regulatory or political climate in any of those countries, or significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates, could affect our ability to expand or continue our operations there, which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, our growth plans include potential expansion in the countries in which we currently operate, as well as, potentially, other countries in the LAC corridor. For example, we began offering remittances to Africa during 2019 and are now exposed to new political, economic and other uncertainties as a result of this geographic expansion, any of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the countries in which we operate may impose or tighten foreign currency exchange control restrictions, taxes or limitations with regard to repatriation of earnings and investments from these countries. If exchange control restrictions, taxes or limitations are imposed or tightened, our ability to receive dividends or other payments from affected jurisdictions could be reduced, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, corporate, contract, property, insolvency, competition, securities and other laws and regulations in many of the countries in which we operate have been, and continue to be, substantially revised. Therefore, the interpretation and procedural safeguards of the new legal and regulatory systems are in the process of being developed and defined, and existing laws and regulations may be applied inconsistently. Also, in some circumstances, it may not be possible to obtain the legal remedies provided for under these laws and regulations in a reasonably timely manner, if at all.\nOur ability to grow in international markets and our future results could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022changes in political and economic conditions and potential instability in certain regions, including in particular the recent civil unrest, terrorism and political turmoil in LAC countries and Africa;\n\u2022restrictions on money transfers to, from and between certain countries;\n\u2022inability to recruit and retain paying agents and customers for new corridors;\n\u2022currency exchange controls, new currency adoptions and repatriation issues;\n\u2022changes in regulatory requirements or in foreign policy, including the adoption of domestic or foreign laws, regulations and interpretations detrimental to our business;\n\u2022possible increased costs and additional regulatory burdens imposed on our business;\n\u2022the implementation of U.S. sanctions, resulting in bank closures in certain countries and the ultimate freezing of our assets;\n\u2022burdens of complying with a wide variety of laws and regulations;\n\u2022possible fraud or theft losses, and lack of compliance by international representatives in foreign legal jurisdictions where collection and legal enforcement may be difficult or costly;\n\u2022inability to maintain or improve our software and technology systems;\n\u2022reduced protection of our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022unfavorable tax rules or trade barriers; and\nIndex\n\u2022inability to secure, train or monitor international agents.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our brand and the intellectual property rights related to our existing and any new or enhanced services, or if we infringe on the rights of others, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Intermex brand is critical to our business. We utilize trademark registrations and other tools to protect our brand. We have not applied for trademark registrations for our name and logo in all geographic markets where we provide services. In those markets where we have applied for trademark registrations, failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our ability to enforce and defend our trademark rights. Our business would be harmed if we were unable to adequately protect our brand and the value of our brand was to decrease as a result.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, trademark and copyright laws and trade secret protection and invention assignment, confidentiality or license agreements to protect the intellectual property rights related to our services, all of which only offer limited protection. We may be subject to third-party claims alleging that we infringe their intellectual property rights or have misappropriated other proprietary rights. We may be required to spend resources to defend such claims or to protect and police our own rights. Some of our legal rights in information or technology that we deem proprietary may not be protected by intellectual property laws, particularly in foreign jurisdictions. The loss of our intellectual property protection, the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection or to successfully defend against claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nThe processes and systems we employ may be subject to patent protection by other parties, and any claims could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn certain countries, including the United States, patent laws permit the protection of processes and systems. We employ processes and systems in various markets that have been used in the industry by other parties for many years. We or other companies that use these processes and systems consider many of them to be in the public domain. If a person were to assert that it holds a patent covering any of the processes or systems we use, we would be required to defend ourselves against such claim. If unsuccessful, we may be required to pay damages for past infringement, which could be trebled if the infringement was found to be willful. We also may be required to seek a license to continue to use the processes or systems. Such a license may require either a single payment or an ongoing license fee. No assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain a license which is reasonable in fee and scope. If a patent owner is unwilling to grant such a license, or we decide not to obtain such a license, we may be required to modify our processes and systems to avoid future infringement.\nThe operation of retail locations creates risks and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have company-operated retail locations for the sale of our services. We may be subject to additional laws and regulations that are triggered by our ownership of retail locations and our employment of individuals who staff our retail locations. There are also certain risks inherent in operating any retail location, including theft, personal injury and property damage and long-term lease obligations.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe had approximately $97.0 million of indebtedness as of December 31, 2019, consisting of borrowings under the term loan facility. Our indebtedness could have important consequences to our investors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to servicing debt, including interest payments and quarterly excess cash flow prepayment obligations;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive environment; and\n\u2022limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.\nThe interest rates in our Credit Agreement (\u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) vary at stated margins above either the London Interbank Offered Rate, Eurodollar Rate or a base rate established by the administrative agent of the facility, all of which are subject to fluctuation. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on such variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates would adversely affect our profitability. See the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s\nIndex\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Intermex-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for more information.\nWe also are subject to capital requirements imposed by various regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We may need access to external capital to support these regulatory requirements in order to maintain our licenses and our ability to earn revenue in these jurisdictions. An interruption of our access to capital could impair our ability to conduct business if our regulatory capital falls below requirements.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom, which regulates the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), publicly announced that it will no longer compel or persuade banks to make LIBOR submissions after 2021. This announcement is expected to practically end LIBOR rates starting in 2022, and while other alternatives have been proposed, it is unclear which, if any, alternative to LIBOR will be available and widely accepted in major financial markets. We currently have borrowings that are subject to LIBOR-based interest rates, including borrowings under our credit facility. If an alternative to LIBOR is not available or widely accepted after 2021, our costs associated with our credit facility may increase and we may need to seek alternative financing.\nUpon the occurrence of an event of default relating to our credit facility, the lenders could elect to accelerate payments due and terminate all commitments to extend further credit.\nUnder our Credit Agreement, upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders will be able to elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to lend additional funds. If we are unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the Credit Agreement could proceed to foreclose against our collateral that secures that indebtedness. We have granted the lenders a security interest in substantially all of our assets, including the assets of certain subsidiaries.\nOur credit facility contains restrictive covenants that may impair our ability to conduct business.\nThe Credit Agreement contains operating covenants and financial covenants that may in each case limit management\u2019s discretion with respect to certain business matters. Among other things, these covenants restrict our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to grant additional liens, consolidate or merge with other entities, purchase or sell assets, declare dividends, incur additional debt, make advances, investments and loans, transact with affiliates, issue equity interests, modify organizational documents and engage in other business. We are required to comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. As a result of these covenants and restrictions, we will be limited in how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or other financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. Failure to comply with such restrictive covenants may lead to default and acceleration under our credit facility and may impair our ability to conduct business. We may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants, which may result in foreclosure of our assets. See the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Intermex-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for more information.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nFor as long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d, including not being required to obtain an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404\u201d), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, which we have elected to do.\nWe will be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following January 19, 2022, the fifth anniversary of us becoming a publicly-traded company, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the last business day of our prior second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active market for our common stock, our share price may be more volatile and the price at which our securities trade could be less than if we did not use these exemptions.\nIndex\nPursuant to the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for so long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nSection 404 requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and generally requires in the same report a report by our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d Accordingly, until we cease being an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d our stockholders will not have the benefit of an independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control environment.\nWe are a holding company with nominal net worth and will depend on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to pay any dividends, and our outstanding debt obligations may limit our ability to pay dividends.\nWe are a holding company with nominal net worth. We do not have any assets or conduct any business operations other than our investments in our subsidiaries. Our business operations are conducted primarily out of our operating subsidiary, Intermex Wire Transfer, LLC. As a result, our ability to pay dividends, if any, will be dependent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from our subsidiaries. Payments to us by our subsidiaries will be contingent upon their respective earnings and subject to any limitations on the ability of such entities to make payments or other distributions to us. See \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Indebtedness-\u201d for additional information. In addition, our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to make any funds available to us.\nFurthermore, on November 7, 2018, the Company and its subsidiaries entered into a financing agreement with, among others, certain of the Company\u2019s domestic subsidiaries as borrowers and a group of banking institutions (as further amended on December 7, 2018, that limits the Company\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things, pay dividends and make certain distributions. For additional information relating to the Credit Agreement, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe intend to retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion, and debt repayment, and we have no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. The declaration, amount, and payment of any future dividends on shares of common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors. Our board of directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition, and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax, and regulatory restrictions, implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us, and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by covenants of our existing and outstanding indebtedness and may be limited by covenants of any future indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nOur ability to meet expectations and projections in any research or reports published by securities or industry analysts, or a lack of coverage by securities or industry analysts, could result in a depressed market price and limited liquidity for our common stock.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. If no or few securities or industry analysts commence coverage of the Company, our stock price would likely be less than that which would obtain if we had such coverage and the liquidity, or trading volume of our common stock may be limited, making it more difficult for a stockholder to sell shares at an acceptable price or amount. If any analysts do cover the Company, their projections may vary widely and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our share price may decline if our actual results do not match the projections of research analysts covering us. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who write reports on us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, our share price or trading volume could decline.\nProvisions in our charter and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.\nOur charter contains provisions that opt out of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d). These provisions include the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred shares, which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nIndex\nIn addition, while we have opted out of Section 203 of the DGCL, our charter contains similar provisions providing that we may not engage in certain \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d with any \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a three-year period following the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless:\n\u2022prior to such time, our board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;\n\u2022upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding certain shares; or\n\u2022at or subsequent to that time, the business combination is approved by our board of directors and by the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.\nThese anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of us. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take corporate actions other than those you desire.\nOur charter designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur charter provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the DGCL or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The exclusive forum provision of our bylaws does not establish exclusive jurisdiction in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for claims that arise under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal securities laws if there is exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction in the federal courts. By becoming our stockholder, you will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our charter related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our charter may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nWe are a no longer a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the Nasdaq rules. However we will continue to qualify for, and may rely on during a one-year transition period, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that would otherwise provide protection to our stockholders.\nWe are no longer a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the Nasdaq listing rules. Consequently, the Nasdaq listing rules will require that we (a) have a majority of independent directors on our board of directors within one year after the date we no longer qualified as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d; and (b)(i) have at least a majority of independent directors on each of the compensation and nominating and governance committees within 90 days after the date we no longer qualified as a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d and (b)(ii) have compensation and nominating and governance committees composed entirely of independent directors within one year of such date. We have satisfied the 90-day requirement of having a majority of independent directors on the compensation and nominating and governance committees and expect to satisfy the other corporate governance requirements during the one-year transition period.\nDuring this transition period, we will continue to qualify for and may continue to utilize the available exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements as permitted by Nasdaq listing rules. Accordingly, during the transition period, you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the Nasdaq listing rules, which could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nBecause Stella Point controls a significant percentage of our common stock, it may influence our major corporate decisions and its interests may conflict with the interests of other holders of our common stock.\nSPC Intermex, an affiliate of Stella Point, beneficially owns approximately 32.5% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock and 23.3% of our common stock as of December 31, 2019. Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, SPC Intermex has the right to designate eight of our directors until it holds less than 10% of our outstanding common stock, and the other parties to the Shareholders Agreement are required to vote their shares of our common stock (representing approximately 42.8% of our outstanding common stock at December 31, 2019) for those designees. Although we are no longer a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the Nasdaq listing rules, SPC Intermex will continue to be able to exert a significant degree of influence over the Company\u2019s management and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of business combinations or dispositions and other extraordinary transactions. SPC Intermex also may have interests that differ from the interests of other holders of our common stock and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. The concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of the Company and may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, Stella Point may in the future own businesses that directly compete with the business of the Company.\nIndex\nCertain of our directors have relationships with Stella Point, which may cause conflicts of interest with respect to our business.\nAs of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, three of our nine directors are affiliated with Stella Point. Stella Point affiliated directors have fiduciary duties to us and, in addition, have duties to their respective funds. As a result, these directors may face real or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting both us and their funds, whose interests may be adverse to ours in some circumstances.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management\u2019s attention.\nOur share price may be volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.", "PERMNO": 16630, "SIC": 6099, "TIC": "IMXI"}
