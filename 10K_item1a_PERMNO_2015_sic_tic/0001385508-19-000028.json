{"cik": "1385508", "company": "OPIANT PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-21", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Prior to making a decision about investing in our securities, you should carefully consider all of the information in this Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties we have described are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our operations. The occurrence of any of these known or unknown risks might cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to our Business, Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWith the exception of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017 and the five month transition period ended December 31, 2017, we have historically generated limited revenue to date and expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have an accumulated deficit of $74.4 million. The likelihood of our future success must be considered in light of the expenses, difficulties, complications and delays often encountered in connection with the clinical trials that will be conducted and on the development of new solutions to common addictions and related disorders. These potential challenges include, but are not limited to, unanticipated clinical trial delays, poor data, changes in the regulatory and competitive landscape and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current budget estimates. In order to complete certain clinical trials and otherwise operate pursuant to our current business strategy, we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses. In addition, we expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and we also expect to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund the operating losses and capital expenditures. We recognize that if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues or source funding, we will not be able to continue operations as currently contemplated, complete planned clinical trials and/or achieve profitability. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability will also negatively impact the value of our securities. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, then the Company will most likely fail.\nWe may not succeed in completing the development of our product candidates, commercializing our products, and generating significant revenues.\nOur current pipeline includes medicines in development for OOR, AUD, OUD, ACO and additional treatment applications. Our products have generated limited revenues. Our ability to generate significant revenues and achieve profitability depends on our ability to successfully complete the development of our product candidates, obtain market approval, successfully launch our products and generate significant revenues. On December 15, 2014, we and Adapt entered into the Adapt Agreement, as amended by the Adapt Amendment entered into between the parties on December 13, 2016, that provides Adapt, now a subsidiary of EBS, with a global license to develop and commercialize our intranasal naloxone Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product, now known as NARCAN\u00ae. The loss for any reason of Adapt/EBS as a key partner could have a significant and adverse impact on our business. If we are unable to retain Adapt/EBS as a partner on commercially acceptable terms, we may not be able to commercialize NARCAN\u00ae as planned and we may experience delays in or suspension of the marketing of NARCAN\u00ae.\nThe future success of our business cannot be determined at this time, and we do not anticipate generating significant revenues from product sales for the foreseeable future. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we expect to generate revenues from NARCAN\u00ae, for which we are dependent on many factors, including the performance of our licensing partner Adapt/EBS and competition in the market. In addition, we have no experience in commercializing on our own and face a number of challenges with respect to commercialization efforts, including, among other challenges:\n\u2022\nhaving inadequate financial or other resources to complete the development of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe inability to manufacture our products in commercial quantities, at an adequate quality, at an acceptable cost or in collaboration with third parties;\n\u2022\nexperiencing delays or unplanned expenditures in product development, clinical testing or manufacturing;\n\u2022\nthe inability to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution channels;\n\u2022\nhealthcare professionals and patients may not accept our treatments;\n\u2022\nwe may not be aware of possible complications from the continued use of our products since we have limited clinical experience with respect to the actual use of our products;\n\u2022\ntechnological breakthroughs in reversing opioid overdoses and treating patients with AUD, OUD and ACO may reduce the demand for our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market for reversing opioid overdoses and treating patients with AUD, OUD and ACO, new alliances between existing market participants and the entrance of new market participants may interfere with our market penetration efforts;\n\u2022\nthird-party payors may not agree to reimburse patients for any or all of the purchase price of our products, which may adversely affect patients\u2019 willingness to purchase our products;\n\u2022\nuncertainty as to market demand may result in inefficient pricing of our products;\n\u2022\nwe may face third party claims of intellectual property infringement;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our products in our markets or may face adverse regulatory or legal actions relating to our products even if regulatory approval is obtained; and\n\u2022\nwe our dependent upon the results of clinical studies relating to our products and the products of our competitors. If data from a clinical trial is unfavorable, we would be reluctant to advance the specific product for the indication for which it was being developed.\nIf we are unable to meet any one or more of these challenges successfully, our ability to effectively commercialize our products could be limited, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGiven our lack of sufficient revenue and cash flow, we may need to raise additional capital, which may be unavailable to us or, even if consummated, may cause dilution or place significant restrictions on our ability to operate.\nSince we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue or cash flow to fund our operations for the foreseeable future, we may need to seek additional equity or debt financing to provide the capital required to maintain or expand our operations. We may also need additional funding to continue the development of our product candidates, build our sales and marketing capabilities, promote brand identity or develop or acquire complementary technologies, assets and companies, as well as for working capital requirements and other operating and general corporate purposes.\nBesides the Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement dated October 13, 2017, we do not currently have any arrangements or credit facilities in place as a source of funds, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital if needed on acceptable terms, or at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or is not available at all, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate the development of our product candidates and other business opportunities and our ability to achieve our business objectives, our competitiveness and our operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Our inability to fund our business could thus lead to the loss of your investment.\nIf we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities and/or equity-linked securities, the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders may be reduced, and accordingly these stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may also issue equity securities and/or equity-linked securities that provide for rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of Common Stock. Given our need for cash and that equity and equity-linked issuances are very common types of fundraising for companies like us, the risk of dilution is particularly significant for our stockholders.\nDebt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include liens on our assets and covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt. Debt financing could also be required to be repaid regardless of our operating results.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some rights to our products or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nWe depend on third parties in connection with our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, which may result in costs and delays that prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval or successfully commercializing our product candidates.\nWe engage third parties to perform various aspects of our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. For instance, on September 10, 2018, we entered into a development and manufacturing agreement for OPNT003 (intranasal nalmefene), a potent, long-acting opioid antagonist for the treatment of opioid overdose with Consort Medical plc (\"Consort\"), a leading contract development and manufacturing organization. Under this agreement, Aesica and Bespak, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Consort, will work with us to produce a pre-filled delivery nasal spray with nalmefene. As part of the agreement, Aesica will supply Opiant with clinical samples and registration batches for the purposes of performing clinical studies and obtaining regulatory approvals. We depend on these third parties to perform these activities on a timely basis in accordance with the protocol, good laboratory practices, good clinical practices, and other regulatory requirements. Our reliance on these third parties for pre-clinical and clinical development activities reduces our control over these activities. Accordingly, if these parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be extended, delayed, terminated or our data may be rejected by the FDA. For example, if Consort were to cease to be able to supply the device to us, our OPNT003 program would be delayed until we obtained an alternative source, which could take a considerable length of time. If there are delays in testing or obtaining regulatory approvals as a result of a third party\u2019s failure to perform, our drug discovery and development costs will likely increase, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nFurther, upon approval by the FDA, Aesica and Bespak will manufacture and supply the commercial device for us. Third parties\u2019 abilities to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our product candidates is dependent on the operation of their facilities which may be impacted by, among other things:\n\u2022\navailability, performance, or contamination of raw materials and components used in the manufacturing process, particularly those for which we have no other source or supplier;\n\u2022\ncapacity of our facility and those of contract manufacturer;\n\u2022\nthe performance of information technology systems;\n\u2022\ncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ninclement weather and natural disasters;\n\u2022\nchanges in forecasts of future demand for product components;\n\u2022\ntiming and actual number of production runs for product components;\n\u2022\npotential facility contamination by microorganisms or viruses;\n\u2022\nupdating of manufacturing specifications; and\n\u2022\nproduct quality success rates and yields.\nIf the efficient manufacture and supply of our product candidates is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments or supply constraints, which may materially impact our ongoing and future pre-clinical studies and clinical trials.\nAny contract manufacturer must undergo a potentially lengthy FDA approval process, as well as other regulatory approval processes, and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. It is a multi-year process to build and license a new manufacturing facility and it can take significant time to qualify and license a contract manufacturer.\nIf regulatory authorities determine that we or our contract manufacturer or certain of our third-party service providers have violated regulations or if they restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, they could prohibit us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. Because our third-party service providers are subject to the FDA and, potentially, in the future, foreign\nregulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party service providers may not be available on a timely basis or at all. If we or our third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us, we may experience delayed shipments, and supply constraints for our products.\nOur current and future operations substantially depend on our Chief Executive Officer and our ability to hire other key personnel, the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations.\nOur business depends and will continue to depend in substantial part on the continued service of Dr. Roger Crystal, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services of Dr. Crystal would significantly impede implementation and execution of our business strategy and may result in the failure to reach our goals.\nOur future viability and ability to achieve sales and profits will also depend on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel in the diverse areas required for continuing operations. There is a risk that we will be unable to attract, train, retain or motivate qualified personnel, both near term or in the future, and the failure to do so may severely damage its prospects.\nOur employment agreements with our named executive officers may require us to pay severance benefits to any of those persons who are terminated in connection with a change in control of us which could harm our financial condition or results.\nCertain of our executive officers are parties to employment agreements that contain change in control and severance provisions providing for aggregate cash payments of up to approximately $3.5 million for severance and other benefits and acceleration of vesting of stock options with a value of approximately $2.4 million, in the event of a termination of employment in connection with a change of control of the Company. The accelerated vesting of options could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and harm the market price of our Common Stock. The payment of these severance benefits could harm our financial conditions and results. In addition, these potential severance payments may discourage or prevent third parties from seeking a business combination with us.\nUnder the Company's agreement with Adapt/EBS, they have the right to license third-party intellectual property which may result in a reduction of our potential royalty and milestone payments.\nUnder the Company's license agreement, with Adapt/EBS (the \"Adapt Agreement\"), Adapt/EBS may seek to license certain intellectual property held by a third-party that Adapt/EBS reasonably determines would be infringed upon through the performance of the Adapt Agreement or that Adapt/EBS otherwise determines is necessary or desirable for Adapt/EBS to perform its obligations under the Adapt Agreement. On March 18, 2019, the Company and Adapt/EBS entered into an amendment to the Adapt Agreement that clarifies the circumstances under which Adapt/EBS may enter into such licenses and deduct a material amount, as provided in the Adapt Agreement, of any upfront payment, milestones or royalties paid to such third-party from any regulatory milestone payments, sales-based milestone payments, and royalty payments payable to the Company under the Adapt Agreement. Following the execution of the amendment, in most situations, in order to exercise its right to deduct any payments with respect thereto, Adapt/EBS will need the consent of the Company that the licensing arrangement is acceptable.\nSome of our programs are partially supported by government grant awards, which may not be available to us in the future.\nWe have received funding under grant award programs funded by governmental agencies, such as the NIDA and BARDA. To fund a portion of our future research and development programs, we may apply for additional grant funding from these or similar governmental agencies. However, funding by these governmental agencies may be significantly reduced or eliminated in the future for a number of reasons. For example, some programs are subject to a yearly appropriations process in Congress. In addition, we may not receive full funding under current or future grants because of budgeting constraints of the agency administering the program or unsatisfactory progress on the study being funded. Therefore, we cannot assure you that we will receive any future grant funding from any government agencies, or, that if received, we will receive the full amount of the particular grant award. Any such reductions could delay the development of our product candidates and the introduction of new products.\nExposure to United Kingdom political developments, including the outcome of the referendum on membership in the European Union, could be costly and difficult to comply with and could seriously harm our business.\nWe have based a significant portion of our non-U.S. operations in the United Kingdom. In June 2016, a referendum was passed in the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d This decision created an uncertain political and economic environment in the United Kingdom and other European Union countries, even though the formal process for leaving the European Union may take years to complete. This formal process began in March 2017, when the United Kingdom served notice to the European Council under Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon. The long-term nature of the United Kingdom\u2019s relationship with the European Union is unclear and there is considerable uncertainty when any relationship will be agreed and implemented. Without further agreement, the United Kingdom will formally leave the European Union in March 2019. The political and economic instability created by Brexit has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets and uncertainty regarding the regulation of pharmaceuticals in the United Kingdom. In particular, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations, including those related to the pricing of pharmaceuticals, as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replicate or replace. If the United Kingdom were to significantly alter its regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals, we could face significant new costs. As a result, Brexit could impair our ability to transact business in the European Union and the United Kingdom. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people between the United Kingdom, the European Union, and elsewhere. The full effect of Brexit is uncertain and depends on any agreements the United Kingdom may make to retain access to European Union markets. Consequently, no assurance can be given about the impact of the outcome and our business, including operational and tax policies, may be seriously harmed or require reassessment if our European operations or presence become a significant part of our business.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and product candidates, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products and product candidates that are similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates may be adversely affected.\nOur commercial success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our products and product candidates. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our products and product candidates that are important to our business, as appropriate. We cannot be certain that patents will be issued or granted with respect to applications that are currently pending or that we may apply for in the future with respect to one or more of our products and product candidates, or that issued or granted patents will not later be found to be invalid and/or unenforceable.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Although we may enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to patentable aspects of our research and development output, such as our employees, distribution partners, consultants, advisors and other third parties, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose such output before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection.\nThe patent position of pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued, and even if issued, the patents may not meaningfully protect our products or product candidates, effectively prevent competitors and third parties from commercializing competitive products or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors or other third parties may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative products in a non-infringing manner.\nChanges in either the patent laws, implementing regulations or interpretation of the patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may also diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions.\nWe cannot be certain that our patents and patent rights will be effective in protecting our products, product candidates and technologies. Failure to protect such assets may have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may face litigation from third parties claiming that our products or business infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights, or seeking to challenge the validity of our patents.\nOur future success is also dependent in part on the strength of our intellectual property, trade secrets and know-how, which have been developed from years of research and development, and on our ability, and the ability of our future collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our products and product candidates, if approved, and use our proprietary technologies without alleged or actual infringement, misappropriation or other violation of the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties.\nIn addition to the litigation with TEVA and Perrigo discussed below, we may be exposed to, or be threatened with, adversarial proceedings or additional future litigation by third parties regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our current and any future product candidates and technology, including interference or derivation proceedings, post grant review and inter partes review before the USPTO or similar adversarial proceedings or litigation in other jurisdictions seeking to challenge the validity of our intellectual property rights, claiming that the Company has misappropriated the trade secrets of others, or claiming that our technologies, products or activities infringe the intellectual property rights of others.\nThere have been many lawsuits and other proceedings involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions and reexamination proceedings before the USPTO, and corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties. We actively track third-party applications with claims that, if valid, could be construed to read upon the use our NARCAN\u00ae product(s) for the treatment of opioid overdose, or other products and indications. Certain of these applications could be granted in the future. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future including, perhaps, the aforementioned allowed patent application, regardless of their merit. There is a risk that third parties may choose to engage in litigation with us to enforce or to otherwise assert their patent rights against us. Even if we believe such claims are without merit, a court of competent jurisdiction could hold that these third-party patents are valid, enforceable and infringed, and the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or are finally determined to be invalid or unenforceable. Similarly, if any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our compositions, formulations, or methods of treatment, prevention or use, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires or is finally determined to be invalid or unenforceable. In either case, such a license may not be available on\ncommercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. Some claimants may have substantially greater resources than we do and may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could. In addition, patent holding companies that focus solely on extracting royalties and settlements by enforcing patent rights may target us. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or to enable the commercialization of our product candidates. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In such an event, we would be unable to further practice our technologies or develop and commercialize any of our product candidates at issue, which could harm our business significantly.\nParties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, if approved. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of management and employee time and resources from our business. Third parties making such claims may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to these legal actions than we or our licensors or collaborators can. In the event of a successful claim of infringement, misappropriation or other violation against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys' fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure.\nSimilarly, we or our licensors or collaborators may initiate such proceedings or litigation against third parties, e.g., to challenge the validity or scope of intellectual property rights controlled by third parties. In order to successfully challenge the validity of any U.S. patent in federal court, we would need to overcome a presumption of validity. As this burden is a high one requiring us to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of any such United States patent claim, there is no assurance that a court would invalidate the claims of any such United States patent.\nPatent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time. The cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. During the course of any patent or other intellectual property litigation or other proceeding, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, rulings on motions, and other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative, the perceived value of our product candidates or intellectual property could be diminished. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock may decline. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, ability to compete in the marketplace, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate our patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property, or those of our licensors. To counter infringement, misappropriation, unauthorized use or other violations, we may be required to file legal claims, which can be expensive and time consuming and divert the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel.\nFor example, within the last 24 months, we along with Adapt (collectively, the \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) have filed six separate complaints for patent infringement against Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. (\u201cTeva Ltd.\u201d) and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Teva Ltd. (\u201cTeva USA\u201d and, together with Teva Ltd., \u201cTeva\u201d) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey arising from Teva USA\u2019s filing of ANDA with the FDA seeking regulatory approval to market a generic version of NARCAN before the expiration of the Company\u2019s patents. Additionally, on October 25, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a similar complaint for patent infringement against Perrigo UK FINCO Limited Partnership (\u201cPerrigo\u201d) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey arising from Perrigo\u2019s ANDA filing with the FDA.\nFor more information about these litigation matters, see Part I, Item 3: Legal Proceedings. We maintain full confidence in our intellectual property portfolio related to NARCAN\u00ae and expect that the Company\u2019s patents will continue to be vigorously defended from any infringement. However, there can be no assurances that we will be successful with respect to these litigation matters or any other litigation matters which may arise in the ordinary course of our business. Such a failure may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition in the future.\nWe may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensees or any future licensors, infringement, misappropriation or other violations of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, there is a risk that a court\nwill decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue. There is also a risk that, even if the validity of such patents is upheld, the court will construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or decide that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the invention. An adverse outcome in a litigation or proceeding involving our patents could limit our ability to assert our patents against those parties or other competitors, and may curtail or preclude our ability to exclude third parties from making and selling similar or competitive products. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition. Similarly, if we assert trademark infringement claims, a court may determine that the marks we have asserted are invalid or unenforceable, or that the party against whom we have asserted trademark infringement has superior rights to the marks in question. In this case, we could ultimately be forced to cease use of such trademarks.\nIn any infringement, misappropriation or other intellectual property litigation, any award of monetary damages we receive may not be commercially valuable. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are concluded. Even if we ultimately prevail in such claims, the monetary cost of such litigation and the diversion of the attention of our management and scientific personnel could outweigh any benefit we receive as a result of the proceedings.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world, which could negatively impact our business.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents covering NARCAN\u00ae, and any future product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Further, licensing partners may not prosecute patents in certain jurisdictions in which we may obtain commercial rights, thereby precluding the possibility of later obtaining patent protection in these countries. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may also export infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidates, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. Furthermore, while we intend to protect our intellectual property rights in our expected significant markets, we cannot ensure that we will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market our product candidates. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates in all of our expected significant foreign markets.\nAdditionally, the requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. For example, unlike other countries, China has a heightened requirement for patentability, and specifically requires a detailed description of medical uses of a claimed drug. In India, unlike the United States, there is no link between regulatory approval of a drug and its patent status. Furthermore, generic or biosimilar drug manufacturers or other competitors may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of our or our licensors\u2019 patents, requiring us or our licensees or any future licensors to engage in complex, lengthy and costly litigation or other proceedings. In addition, certain countries in Europe and developing countries, including China and India, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we and our licensees or any future licensors may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we or our licensees or any future licensors are compelled to grant a license to a third party, which could\nmaterially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our and our licensees\u2019 or any future licensors\u2019 efforts to enforce intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we own or license.\nWe may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants, contractors or advisors have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated the intellectual property of a third party, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the intellectual property and other proprietary information, know-how or trade secrets of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed such intellectual property or other proprietary information. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nIn addition, while we typically require our employees, consultants and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. To the extent that we fail to obtain such assignments, such assignments do not contain a self-executing assignment of intellectual property rights or such assignments are breached, we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Such intellectual property rights could be awarded to a third party, and we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to commercialize our technology or products. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management and scientific personnel.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance and annuity fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our products, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, the value of our technology could be materially adversely affected and our business would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and products, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, in seeking to develop and maintain a competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, consultants, independent contractors, advisors, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, suppliers and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with employees and certain consultants. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets and know-how by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary technologies will be effective.\nSince our inception, we have sought to contract with manufacturers to supply commercial quantities of pharmaceutical formulations and products. As a result, we have disclosed, under confidentiality agreements, various aspects of our technology with potential manufacturers and suppliers. We believe that these disclosures, while necessary for our business, may have resulted and may result in the attempt by potential manufacturers and suppliers to improperly assert ownership claims to our technology in an attempt to gain an advantage in negotiating manufacturing and supplier rights.\nWe cannot guarantee that our trade secrets and other proprietary and confidential information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. Any party with whom we have executed such an agreement may breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts both within and outside the United States may be less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. Further, if any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such third party, or those to whom they communicate such technology or information, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our business and competitive position could be harmed.\nTrade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect as trade secrets and know-how will over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the publication of journal articles, and the movement of personnel skilled in the art from company to company or academic to industry scientific positions. If we fail to prevent material disclosure of the know-how, trade secrets and other intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, we will not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even if we are able to adequately protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, our trade secrets could otherwise become known or could be independently discovered by our competitors. For example, competitors could purchase our products and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, design around our protected technology or develop their own competitive technologies that fall outside of our intellectual property rights. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, in the absence of patent protection, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate, from using that technology or information to compete with us.\nWe may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property, trade secrets or confidential information, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our business.\nOnce granted, patents may remain open to opposition, interference, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, nullification or derivation action in court or before patent offices or similar proceedings for a given period after allowance or grant, during which time third parties can raise objections against such grant. In the course of such proceedings, which may continue for a protracted period of time, the patent owner may be compelled to limit the scope of the allowed or granted claims thus attacked, or may lose the allowed or granted claims altogether. In addition, the degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because even granted intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u2022\nothers may be able to make formulations that are similar to our NARCAN\u00ae or other formulations but that are not covered by the claims of our patent rights\u037e\n\u2022\nthe patents of third parties may have an adverse effect on our business;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors or any future strategic partners might not have been the first to conceive or reduce to practice the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors or any future strategic partners might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions\u037e\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights\u037e\n\u2022\nit is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents\u037e\n\u2022\nissued patents that we may own or that we exclusively license in the future may not provide us with any competitive advantage, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors\u037e\n\u2022\nour competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets\u037e\n\u2022\nthird parties performing manufacturing or testing for us using our product candidates or technologies could use the intellectual property of others without obtaining a proper license;\n\u2022\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nShould any of these events occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe expiration or loss of patent protection may adversely affect our future revenues and operating earnings.\nWe rely on patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing and sale of our products and product candidates. In particular, patent protection is important in the development and eventual commercialization of our products and product candidates. Patents covering our products and product candidates normally provide market exclusivity, which is important in order for our products and product candidates to become profitable.\nCertain of our patents will expire in the next 16 years. While we are seeking additional patent coverage which may protect the technology underlying these patents, there can be no assurances that such additional patent protection will be granted, or if granted, that these patents will not be infringed upon or otherwise held enforceable. Even if we are successful in obtaining a patent, patents have a limited lifespan. In the U.S., the natural expiration of a utility patent typically is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available; however, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Without patent protection, our products and product candidates, we may be open to competition from generic versions of such methods and devices\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of our Products\nWe may be exposed to product liability risks, and clinical and preclinical liability risks, which could place a substantial financial burden upon us should we be sued.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical formulations and products. We cannot be sure that claims will not be asserted against us. A successful liability claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot give assurances that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain adequate product liability insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, or that such insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Claims or losses in excess of any product liability insurance coverage that we may obtain could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products may have undesirable side effects which may delay or prevent marketing approval, or, if approval is received, require it to be taken off the market, require it to include safety warnings or otherwise limit sales of the product.\nUnforeseen side effects from our products and product candidates could arise either during clinical development or, if approved, after the products have been marketed. This could cause regulatory approvals for, or market acceptance of, the products to be harder and more costly to obtain.\nTo date, no serious adverse events have been attributed to our products and product candidates. The results of our planned or any future clinical trials may show that our products and product candidates cause undesirable or unacceptable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, and result in delay of, or failure to obtain, marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities, or result in marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities with restrictive label warnings. If our product candidates receive marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable or unacceptable side effects caused by the use of our products:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the products, which would force us to remove its products from the market;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, specific warnings, a contraindication, or field alerts to physicians, pharmacies and others;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to change instructions regarding the way the products are administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the products;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to limitations on how it may promote the products;\n\u2022\nsales of the products may decrease significantly;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us or our potential future collaborators from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the products or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from the sale of our products.\nWe currently have no marketing and sales organization and have no experience marketing pharmaceutical products. If we are unable to establish our own marketing and sales capabilities, or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our products after approval, we may not be able to generate product revenues.\nWe do not have a sales organization for the marketing, sales and distribution of any pharmaceutical products. In order to commercialize our products or any other product candidates we may develop or acquire in the future, we must develop these capabilities on our own or make arrangements with third parties for the marketing, sales and distribution of its products. The establishment and development of our own sales force will be expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch, and we cannot be certain that it would be able to successfully develop this capability. As a result, we may seek one or more partners to handle some or all of the sales, marketing and distribution of our products. There also may be certain markets within the United States and elsewhere for our products for which we may seek a co-promotion arrangement. However, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with third parties to sell our products on favorable terms, or at all. In the event, we are unable to develop its own marketing and sales force or collaborate with a third party marketing and sales organization, we will not be able to commercialize our products or any other product candidates that we develop, which will negatively impact our ability to generate product revenues. Furthermore, whether we commercialize products on our own or rely on a third party to do so, our ability to generate revenue would be dependent on the effectiveness of the sales force. In addition, to the extent we rely on third parties to commercialize our approved products, we would likely receive less revenues than if we commercialized these products ourselves.\nThe market for our products is rapidly changing and competitive, and new drugs, which may be developed by others, could impair our ability to maintain and grow our business and remain competitive.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is subject to rapid and substantial technological change. Developments by others may render our technologies and products noncompetitive or obsolete. We also may be unable to keep pace with technological developments and other market factors. Technological competition from medical device, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and others diversifying into the field is intense and is expected to increase. Many of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities and budgets than we do, as well as substantially more marketing, manufacturing, financial and managerial resources. These entities represent significant competition for us.\nOur reliance on collaborations with third parties to develop and commercialize our products, such as the Adapt Agreement to develop and commercialize, NARCAN\u00ae is subject to inherent risks and may result in delays in product development and lost or reduced revenues, restricting our ability to commercialize our products and adversely affecting our profitability.\nWith respect to the products we have licensed, we depend upon collaborations with third parties to develop these product candidates and also depend substantially upon third parties to commercialize these products. As a result, our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval of, manufacture and commercialize our existing and possibly future product candidates depends upon our ability to maintain existing, and enter into and maintain new, contractual and collaborative arrangements with others. We also engage, and intend in the future to continue to engage, contract manufacturers and clinical trial investigators.\nIn addition, although not a primary component of our current strategy, the identification of new compounds or product candidates for development has led us in the past, and may continue to require us, to enter into license or other collaborative agreements with others, including other pharmaceutical companies and research institutions. Such collaborative agreements for the acquisition of new compounds or product candidates would typically require us to pay license fees, make milestone payments and/or pay royalties. Furthermore, these agreements may result in our revenues being lower than if we developed our product candidates and in our loss of control over the development of our product candidates.\nContractors or collaborators may have the right to terminate their agreements with us or reduce their payments to us under those agreements on limited or no notice and for no reason or reasons outside of our control. For example, we may be unable to maintain our relationship with Adapt/EBS on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all, as the Adapt Agreement may be terminated\nby Adapt/EBS in its sole discretion, either in its entirety or in respect of one or more countries, at any time by providing 60 days prior notice to us. In addition, Adapt/EBS may have similar or more established relationships with our competitors or larger customers which may negatively impact our relationship with Adapt/EBS. Moreover, the loss for any reason of Adapt/EBS as a key partner could have a materially significant and adverse impact on our business. If we are unable to retain Adapt/EBS as a partner on commercially acceptable terms, we may not be able to commercialize NARCAN\u00ae and we may experience delays in or suspension of the marketing of our products. The same could apply to other product candidates we may develop or acquire in the future. Our dependence upon third parties to assist with the development and commercialization of our product candidates may adversely affect our ability to generate profits or acceptable profit margins and our ability to develop and deliver such products on a timely and competitive basis. Additionally, our Aegis License Agreement shall expire upon the expiration of our obligation to pay royalties under the Aegis License Agreement; provided, however, that we shall have the right to terminate the License granted on a product-by-product or country-by-country basis upon 30 days\u2019 prior written notice to Aegis.\nIf our current or future licensees exercise termination rights they may have, or if these license agreements terminate because of delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, or for other reasons, and we are not able to establish replacement or additional research and development collaborations or licensing arrangements, we may not be able to develop and/or commercialize our product candidates. Moreover, any future collaborations or license arrangements we may enter into may not be on terms favorable to us.\nA further risk we face with the collaborations is that business combinations and changes in the collaborator or their business strategy may adversely affect their willingness or ability to complete their obligations to us.\nOur current or any future collaborations or license arrangements ultimately may not be successful. Our agreements with collaborators typically allows them discretion in electing whether to pursue various development, regulatory, commercialization and other activities, such as the Adapt Agreement.\nIf any collaborator were to breach its agreement with us or otherwise fail to conduct collaborative activities in a timely or successful manner, the pre-clinical or clinical development or commercialization of the affected product candidate or research program would be delayed or terminated.\nOther risks associated with our collaborative and contractual arrangements with others include the following:\n\u2022\nwe may not have day-to-day control over the activities of our contractors or collaborators;\n\u2022\nour collaborators may fail to defend or enforce patents they own on compounds or technologies that are incorporated into the products we develop with them;\n\u2022\nthird parties may not fulfill their regulatory or other obligations; and\n\u2022\nwe may not realize the contemplated or expected benefits from collaborative or other arrangements; and disagreements may arise regarding a breach of the arrangement, the interpretation of the agreement, ownership of proprietary rights, clinical results or regulatory approvals.\nThese factors could lead to delays in the development of our product candidates and/or the commercialization of our products or reduction in the milestone payments we receive, or could result in us not being able to commercialize our products. Further, disagreements with our contractors or collaborators could require or result in litigation or arbitration, which would be time-consuming and expensive. Our ultimate success may depend upon the success and performance on the part of these third parties. If we fail to maintain these relationships or establish new relationships as required, development of our product candidates and/or the commercialization of our products will be delayed or may never be realized.\nOur product pipeline includes pre-clinical product candidates, such as a vaccine for heroin addiction. We may not be successful in completing the pre-clinical work required for these product candidates, the clinical trials necessary for obtaining market approval, or being able to commercially launch these product candidates.\nIn October 2016, we licensed a vaccine to treat heroin addiction from the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (\"WRAIR\"). This is an early-stage asset and requires significant additional pre-clinical research and development before human testing may be initiated. We plan to work closely with scientists at WRAIR in order to advance the program into the clinic and determine if this vaccine is safe and effective in a patient population. As a result, we may be unable to obtain sufficient pre-clinical data to apply for, or gain, the requisite authorizations to commence human clinical testing on either this asset or other pre-clinical assets we may pursue. However, even if we are successful moving a pre-clinical program into humans, the ultimate success of any development program is uncertain. If we obtain positive clinical data for either this or other pre-clinical assets\nwe may develop, there will be a significant time lag before the asset gains regulatory approval or commercialization may begin, if ever.\nWe are exposed to product liability, non-clinical and clinical liability risks which could place a substantial financial burden upon us should lawsuits be filed against us.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical formulations and products. We expect that such claims are likely to be asserted against us at some point. In addition, the use in our clinical trials of pharmaceutical formulations and products and the subsequent sale of these formulations or products by us or our potential collaborators may cause us to bear a portion of or all product liability risks. Any claim under any existing insurance policies or any insurance policies secured in the future may be subject to certain exceptions, and may not be honored fully, in part, in a timely manner, or at all, and may not cover the full extent of liability we may actually face. Therefore, a successful liability claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the products we provide to customers, and damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products, which could adversely affect our business/operating margins, revenues and competitive position.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation of our Industry\nLegislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare system may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nIn both the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to sell future products and profitability. On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, \u201cPPACA\u201d), which includes a number of health care reform provisions and requires most U.S. citizens to have health insurance. The new law, among other things, imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products, addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, and establishes a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance also have been added, which may require modification of business practices with health care practitioners.\nIn the coming years, additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our future products, and we could be adversely affected by current and future health care reforms.\nWe are subject to intense regulation from the U.S. Government and such other governments and quasi-official regulatory bodies where our products are and product candidates may be sold.\nBoth before and after regulatory approval to market a particular product candidate, including our product candidates, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, distribution and record keeping related to the product are subject to extensive, ongoing regulatory requirements, including, without limitation, submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with (\u201ccGMP\u201d) requirements and good clinical practice requirements for any clinical trials we conduct post-approval. As a result, we are subject to a number of governmental and other regulatory risks, which include:\n\u2022\nclinical development is a long, expensive and uncertain process; delay and failure can occur at any stage of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour clinical trials are dependent on patient enrollment and regulatory approvals; we do not know whether our planned trials will begin on time, or at all, or will be completed on schedule, or at all;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or other regulatory authorities may not approve a clinical trial protocol or may place a clinical trial on hold;\n\u2022\nwe rely on third parties, such as consultants, contract research organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct clinical trials for our drug candidates and if we or any of our third-party contractors fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, such as cGMP requirements, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, the European Medicines Agency or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials;\n\u2022\nif the clinical development process is completed successfully, our ability to derive revenues from the sale of our product candidates will depend on us first obtaining FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory approvals, each of which are subject to unique risks and uncertainties;\n\u2022\nthere is no assurance that we will receive FDA or corollary foreign approval for any of our product candidates for any indication; we are subject to government regulation for the commercialization of our product candidates\n\u2022\nwe have not received regulatory approval in the United States for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates;\n\u2022\neven if one or more of our product candidates does obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve such product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than our requests, may not approve the price we intend to charge for our products, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials or may approve with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate;\n\u2022\nundesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities;\n\u2022\nlater discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with the regulatory requirements of FDA and other applicable United Statesc and foreign regulatory authorities could subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions;\n\u2022\nthe FDA's policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates, and if we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained; and\n\u2022\nwe may be liable for contamination or other harm caused by hazardous materials used in the operations of our business.\nIn addition, our operations are also subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse, physician payment transparency and privacy and security laws, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare or Medicaid programs. This statute has been applied to pharmaceutical manufacturer marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies and relationships with healthcare providers. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nFederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions that prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be present, claims for payment or approval to the federal government that are false or fraudulent, knowingly making a false statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government. The government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes;\n\u2022\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) and its implementing regulations, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, also imposes certain regulatory and contractual requirements regarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nFederal \u201csunshine\u201d requirements imposed by the PPACA on drug manufacturers regarding any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, and any ownership and investment interests held by such\nphysicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up an aggregate of $150,000 per year (and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for \u201cknowing failures\u201d), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission, and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations; and\n\u2022\nState and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require drug manufacturers to comply with the industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of certain health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA.\nMany of our business practices are subject to scrutiny by regulatory and government enforcement authorities, as well as to lawsuits brought by private citizens under federal and state laws. Failure to comply with applicable law or an adverse decision in lawsuits may result in adverse consequences to us.\nThe laws governing our conduct in the U.S., and the conduct of collaborators, licensors or licensees on whom the success of our business relies, are enforceable by administrative, civil, and criminal penalties. Violations of laws such as the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Social Security Act (including the Anti-Kickback Statute), and the Federal False Claims Act, and any regulations promulgated under the authority of the preceding, may result in a range of enforcement action including jail sentences, fines integrity oversight and reporting obligations and/or exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs, as may be determined by Medicare, Medicaid and the Department of Health and Human Services and other regulatory authorities as well as by the courts in response to actions brought by the Department of Justice. FDA regulates drugs throughout the development process, from preclinical and clinical trials through approval and postmarketing requirements. Failure to fully comply with FDA law may cause the FDA to issue inspectional observations, untitled or warning letters, bring an enforcement action, suspend or withdraw an approved product from the market, require a recall or institute fines or civil fines, or could result in disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecution, any of which (whether applied directly to us or to our collaborators, licensors, or licensees) could harm our reputation and our business. There can be no assurance that our activities, or those of our collaborators, licensors or licensees, will not come under the scrutiny of regulators and other government authorities or that our practices will not be found to violate applicable laws, rules and regulations or prompt lawsuits by private citizen \"relators\" under federal or state false claims laws.\nLaws impacting the U.S. healthcare system are subject to a great deal of uncertainty, which may result in adverse consequences to our business.\nThere have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system, reduce the costs of healthcare and change medical reimbursement policies. Doctors, clinics, hospitals and other users of our products may decline to purchase our products to the extent there is uncertainty regarding coverage from government or commercial payors. Further proposed legislation, regulation and policy changes affecting third-party reimbursement are likely. Among other things, Congress has in the past proposed changes to and the repeal of the PPACA, and lawsuits have been brought challenging aspects of the law at various points. There have been repeated recent attempts by Congress to repeal or replace the PPACA. Some of the provisions of the PPACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the PPACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has previously been successful at passing comprehensive repeal legislation through both Chambers of Congress, it had then been vetoed by former President Obama and full repeal legislation is unlikely in the current political climate. However, Congress has passed two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December of 2017 included a provision that would repeal one of the primary pillars of the law, the PPACA\u2019s individual mandate penalty that essentially assessed a monetary penalty or fine on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain fees mandated by the PPACA, including the so-called \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Moreover, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 among other things, amends the PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole\u201d. Congress may consider other legislation to repeal or replace elements of the PPACA on a provision-by-provision basis. In addition, there have been recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, control drug costs, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. We are unable to predict what legislation or regulation, if any, relating to the health care industry or third-party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future at the state or federal level, or what effect such legislation or regulation may have on us. Denial of coverage and reimbursement of our products, or the revocation or changes to coverage and reimbursement policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are planning to pursue the FDA 505(b)(2) pathway for our product candidates, and if we are not able to successfully do so, seeking approval of these product candidates through the 505(b)(1) NDA pathway would require full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness. Although we find the feedback received from the FDA to date generally encouraging toward our interest in pursuing the 505(b)(2) pathway for the treatment of AUD and opioid overdose, such feedback is preliminary only and includes a number of comments and recommendations that we will need to address in our drug development program to meet FDA standards for approval. In addition, our nasally delivered product candidates will include a drug delivery device, and that constituent part will be evaluated by the FDA, as will the combination products as a whole, under our NDA. Even if we are able to pursue the 505(b)(2), we could be subject to legal challenges and regulatory changes which might result in extensive delays or result in our 505(b)(2) application being unsuccessful.\nSection 505(b)(2) of the FDA permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Section 505(b)(2), if applicable to us, would allow an NDA we submit to the FDA to rely in part on data in the public domain or the FDA's prior conclusions regarding the safety and effectiveness of approved compounds, which could expedite the development program for a product candidate by potentially decreasing the amount of clinical data that we would need to generate in order to obtain FDA approval. We plan to pursue this pathway for our product candidates.\nIf the FDA does not allow us to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway as anticipated, we would need to reconsider our plans and might not be able to commercialize our product candidates in a cost-efficient manner, or at all. If we were to pursue approval under the 505(b)(1) NDA pathway, we would be subject to more extensive requirements and risks.\nIn addition, medical products containing a combination of new drugs, biological products, or medical devices are regulated as \u201ccombination products\u201d in the United States. Each constituent part of a combination product is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of constituent part, whether a new drug, biologic, or device. In order to facilitate pre-market review of combination products, the FDA designates one of its centers to have primary jurisdiction for the pre-market review and regulation of the overall product based upon a determination by FDA of the primary mode of action of the combination product, and typically one application (e.g., for a drug/device combination product assigned to CDER, an NDA - either under 505(b)(1) or 505(b)(2)) will be made.\nWhen evaluating products that utilize a specific drug delivery system or device, the FDA will evaluate the characteristics of that delivery system and its functionality, as well as the potential for undesirable interactions between the drug and the delivery system, including the potential to negatively impact the safety or effectiveness of the drug. The FDA review process can be more complicated for combination products, and may result in delays, particularly if novel delivery systems are involved. We rely on third parties for the design and manufacture of the delivery systems for our products, and in some cases for the right to refer to their data on file with the FDA or other regulators. Quality or design concerns with the delivery system, or commercial disputes with these third-parties, could delay or prevent regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates.\nIn some instances over the last few years, certain brand-name pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA's interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) and legally challenged decisions by the agency. If an FDA decision or action relative to our product candidate, or the FDA's interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) more generally, is successfully challenged, it could result in delays or even prevent the FDA from approving a 505(b)(2) application for our product candidates.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are subject to special requirements designed to protect the patent rights of sponsors of previously approved drugs that are referenced in a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. A claim by the applicant that a patent is invalid or will not be infringed is subject to challenge by the patent holder, requirements may give rise to patent litigation and mandatory delays in approval (i.e., a 30-month stay) of a 505(b)(2) application. It is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products. If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the new product. However, even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition.\nEven if we are able to utilize the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, there is no guarantee this would ultimately lead to accelerated product development or earlier approval. Even if approved pursuant to the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, a drug may be subject to the same post-approval limitations, conditions and requirements as any other drug.\nClinical trials for our product candidates have in some cases or may in the future be conducted outside the United States and not under an IND, and where this is the case, the FDA may not accept data from such trials.\nAlthough the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States and not under an IND in support of research or marketing applications for our product candidates, this is subject to certain conditions set out in 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 312.120. For example, such foreign clinical trials should be conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee and obtaining the informed consent from subjects of the clinical trials. The FDA must also be able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection if the agency deems it necessary. The foreign clinical data should also be applicable to the United States population and United States medical practice. Other factors that may affect the acceptance of foreign clinical data include differences in clinical conditions, study populations or regulatory requirements between the United States and the foreign country.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe price of our Common Stock could be highly volatile due to a number of factors, which could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.\nOur Common Stock closed as high as $24.40 and as low as $5.35 per share between January 1, 2016 and August 28, 2017 on the OTCQB. On October 2, 2017 we changed our state of incorporation from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated October 2, 2017, whereby we merged with and into our recently formed, wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary. On August 24, 2017, we received approval for up-listing to the Nasdaq Capital Market and our Common Stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on August 29, 2017. Our Common Stock closed as high as $50.50 and as low as $12.89 per share between August 29, 2017 and March 15, 2019. On March 15, 2019 the closing price of our Common Stock, as reported on the Nasdaq Capital Market was $14.70. Historically, the over-the-counter markets for securities, such as our Common Stock, have experienced extreme price fluctuations. Some of the factors leading to this volatility include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncements of product releases by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of acquisitions and/or partnerships by us or our competitors; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions.\nAlthough shares of our Common Stock currently trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cOPNT\u201d, there\nis no assurance that our stock will not continue to be volatile while listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market in the future.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our Common Stock.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. Accordingly, we do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future, but will review this policy from time to time as circumstances dictate.\nCertain of our executive officers and directors control the direction of our business by means of a significant collective ownership of our Common Stock. The concentrated beneficial ownership of our Common Stock may prevent other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nDr. Roger Crystal, our Chief Executive Officer and a director, Dr. Gabrielle Silver, Lead Independent Director, Dr. Michael Sinclair, a director, Ann MacDougall, a director, Thomas T. Thomas, a director, David O'Toole, our Chief Financial Officer and Dr. Phil Skolnick, our Chief Scientific Officer collectively beneficially own approximately 37% of our outstanding Common Stock as of December 31, 2018. As a result, such executive officers and directors effectively control the Company and have the ability to exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors, amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation, and any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all our assets and other corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership could be disadvantageous to other stockholders with differing interests from such executive officers and directors.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could prevent or delay transactions that our stockholders may favor and may prevent stockholders from changing the direction of our business or management.\nAfter giving effect to our merger into our wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary, provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended and restated, and Bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, and may also frustrate or prevent any attempt by stockholders to change our direction or management. For example, these provisions:\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nestablish a staggered board of directors such that all members of the Board are not elected at one time;\n\u2022\nallow only the Board to fill any vacancy in the Board by reason of death, resignation or otherwise, or if the number of directors shall be increased; and\n\u2022\nrequire a vote of a majority of the shares of our outstanding stock entitled to vote at an election of directors to remove a director.\nCompliance with changing corporate governance and public disclosure regulations may result in additional expense.\nKeeping abreast of, and in compliance with, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and any new Securities and Exchange Commission regulations will require an increased amount of management attention and external resources. We intend to continue to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards, which may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nOur Common Stock is thinly traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market exchange and no assurances can be made about stock performance, liquidity, or maintenance of our Nasdaq listing.\nHistorically, our Common Stock was quoted on the OTCQB, which provided significantly less liquidity than a securities exchange (such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market). On August 24, 2017, our Common Stock was approved for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Beginning on August 29, 2017, our Common Stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cOPNT\u201d. Although currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet the Nasdaq Capital Market\u2019s minimum listing requirements or that of any other national exchange. In addition, there can be no assurances that a liquid market will be created for our Common Stock. If we are unable to maintain listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market or if a liquid market for our Common Stock does not develop, our common stock may remain thinly traded.", "PERMNO": 16904, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "OPNT"}
