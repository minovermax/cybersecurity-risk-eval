{"cik": "1549346", "company": "Shutterstock, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the financial and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business may also be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial. If any of the following risks, such other risks or the risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d, actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and prospects could be materially adversely affected. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain customers of, and contributors to, our creative platform in a cost-efficient manner. If customers reduce or cease their spending with us, or if content contributors reduce or end their participation on our platform, our business will be harmed.\nThe continued use of our creative platform by customers and contributors is critical to our success. Our future performance largely depends on our ability to attract new, and retain existing, paying customers and contributors. The majority of our revenue is derived from customers who have purchased from us in the past. Our ability to attract new customers and contributors, and to incentivize our customers to continue purchasing our products and our contributors to add new content to our platform depends on several factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe scope of content available for licensing;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nthe features and functionality of our platform;\n\u2022\nour current products and services and ability to expand our offerings;\n\u2022\nour customers\u2019 and contributors\u2019 experience in using our platform; and\n\u2022\nthe quality and accuracy of our search algorithms.\nWe spend a significant amount on marketing activities to acquire new customers and retain and engage existing customers, and we expect our marketing expenses to continue to account for a significant portion of our operating expenses. For example, in 2018, 2017 and 2016 our advertising costs, which have historically been the most significant component of our marketing expenses, were approximately $91.5 million, $76.6 million and $64.9 million, respectively. If our marketing activities prove less successful than anticipated in attracting new customers or retaining existing customers, we may not be able to recover our marketing spend, we may not acquire new customers or our cost to acquire new customers may increase, and our existing customers may reduce the frequency or size of their purchases from us. Further, a significant portion of our marketing spend consists of search engine marketing and a major search engine operator could change its algorithms in a manner that negatively affects our paid or non-paid search ranking, and competitive dynamics could impact the effectiveness of search engine marketing or search engine optimization. If our marketing efforts to attract new paying customers or retain existing paying customers are not successful, we may not accomplish cost-effective acquisition of customers.\nFurther, our growth strategy relies on network effects: we rely in part on a growing audience of paying users to attract more content from contributors, thereby increasing our content selection and in turn attracting additional paying customers. For example, our global strategy relies on enabling easier global access in order to attract new contributions of local content, in turn attracting more paying customers who have preferences for local content.\nIf we are unable to grow our customer and contributor base, or retain our existing contributors and paying customers, or are unable to attract paying customers in a cost-effective manner, our financial performance, operating results and business may be adversely affected.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive with low barriers to entry and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could suffer.\nThe industry in which we operate is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving, with low barriers to entry. We compete with a wide and diverse array of companies, from significant media companies to individual content creators. Our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large established companies to emerging start-ups across different industries, including online marketplace and traditional stock content suppliers of current and archival creative and editorial imagery, photography, stock video clips, and music; specialized visual content companies in specific geographic segments; providers of commercially licensable music; websites specializing in image search, recognition, discovery and consumption;\nwebsites that host and store images, art and other related products; providers of free images, photography, music, stock video clips and related tools (including offerings by our partners); social networking and social media services; and commissioned photographers and photography agencies.\nWe believe that the principal competitive factors in the content industry include: quality, relevance and breadth of content; the ability to source new content; content licensing options and the degree to which users are protected from legal risk; the effective use of current and emerging technology; accessibility of content, distribution capability, and speed and ease of search and fulfillment; brand recognition and reputation; customer service; and the global nature of a company\u2019s interfaces and marketing efforts, including local content, languages, currencies, and payment methods. If our competitors use their experience and resources to provide an offering that is more attractive to customers across these categories, or if our competitors innovate and provide products faster than we can, we may be unable to compete effectively and our business will be harmed.\nMany of our competitors have or may obtain significantly greater financial, marketing or other resources or greater brand awareness than we have. Some of these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or expanding technology and devote more resources to product development, marketing or content acquisition than we can. Additionally, some of these competitors may acquire, invest in or partner with other competitors or leverage their own content-related competencies to enter our market. While we believe that there are obstacles to creating a meaningful network effect between customers and contributors, the barriers to creating a platform that allows for the licensing of digital content or provides workflow tools are low. If competitors offer higher royalties, easier submission workflows, or less rigorous vetting processes or incentivize contributors to distribute their content on an exclusive basis, contributors may choose to stop distributing new content with us or remove their existing content from our collection. Further, as technology advances or other market dynamics make creating, sourcing, archiving, indexing, reviewing, searching or delivering content easier or more affordable, our existing and potential competitors may also seek to develop new products, technologies or capabilities that could render many of the products, services and content types that we offer obsolete or less competitive. For any of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors.\nIn addition, demand for our products and services is sensitive to price. Many external factors, including our technology and personnel costs and our competitors\u2019 pricing and marketing strategies, could significantly impact our pricing strategies and we could fail to meet our customers\u2019 pricing expectations. Increased competition and pricing pressures may result in reduced sales, lower margins, losses or the failure of our product and services to maintain and grow their current market share, any of which could harm our business.\nIf we cannot continue to innovate technologically or develop, market and offer new products and services, or enhance existing technology and products and services to meet customer requirements, our ability to grow our revenue could be impaired.\nOur growth largely depends on our ability to innovate and add value to our existing creative platform and to provide our customers and contributors with a scalable, high-performing technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably handle increased customer and contributor usage globally, as well as the deployment of new features. For example, a video clip represents significantly more data as compared to a still image, and if the proportion of our business related to video clip licensing and our video clip library continues to grow, we will need to expand and enhance our technological capabilities to ingest, store and search video clips and audio content in ways that are similar to our management of images. Without improvements to our technology and infrastructure, our operations might suffer from unanticipated system disruptions, slow website or application performance or unreliable service levels, any of which could negatively affect our reputation and ability to attract and retain customers and contributors. We are currently making, and plan to continue making, significant investments to support and enhance the technology and infrastructure supporting our customer and contributor facing web properties and software platforms and to evolve our information processes and computer systems to more efficiently run our business and remain competitive. Our technology investments have increased, and may continue to increase, our operating costs and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits, significant growth or increased market share from these investments for several years, if at all. If we are unable to manage our investments successfully or in a cost-efficient manner, our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nOur growth also depends, in part, on our ability to identify and develop new products and services and enhance existing products and services. The process of developing new products and services and enhancing existing products and services and bringing products or enhancements to market in a timely manner is complex, costly and uncertain and we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges such as product planning and timing, technical hurdles, or a lack of resources. The success of our products depends on several factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nanticipate customers\u2019 and contributors\u2019 changing needs or emerging technological trends;\n\u2022\ntimely develop, complete and introduce innovative new products and enhancements;\n\u2022\ndifferentiate our products from those of our competitors;\n\u2022\neffectively market our products and gain market acceptance;\n\u2022\nprice our products competitively; and\n\u2022\nprovide timely, effective and accurate support to our customers and contributors.\nWe may be unable to successfully identify new product opportunities or enhancements, develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner, or achieve market acceptance of our products. There can be no assurance that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or less competitive. If we are unsuccessful in innovating our technology or in identifying new or enhancing our existing product offerings, our ability to compete in the marketplace, to attract and retain customers and contributors and to grow our revenue could be impaired.\nChanges in internet search engine algorithms and dynamics could have a negative impact on traffic for our sites and ultimately, our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on organic traffic generated from search engines to attract users to our websites. This organic traffic is dependent in part upon the way in which links to and information from our web properties are featured on search engine result pages. Search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user\u2019s search, such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our web properties can be negatively affected. In addition, a search engine could, for competitive or other purposes, alter its search algorithms or results causing our websites to place lower in organic search query results. Furthermore, our failure to successfully manage our search engine optimization could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our web properties, as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic. If a major search engine changes its algorithms in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking of our websites or those of our partners, or if we fail to successfully manage our search engine optimization, our business and financial performance would be adversely affected.\nWe face risks resulting from the digital content in our collection such as unforeseen costs related to infringement claims, potential liability arising from indemnification claims and the inability to prevent misuse.\nOur digital content is licensed from copyright owners such as photographers, illustrators, videographers and composers who contribute content to our collection and, subject to our licenses with our contributors, we typically offer customers a perpetual, royalty-free license to use the content for their editorial or commercial needs. Although we have implemented measures to review the content that we accept into our collection, we cannot guarantee that each contributor holds the rights or releases he or she claims or that such rights and releases are adequate, which in turn affects the licenses granted to our customer. As a result, we and our customers have been, and in the future will likely be, subject to third-party claims, including intellectual property infringement claims, related to our customers\u2019 use of our content.\nUnder our license agreements with our contributors, our contributors represent and warrant that they have the right to license content to us. Under our license agreements with our customers, we expressly represent and warrant that unaltered content downloaded and used in compliance with our license agreements and applicable law will not infringe any copyright, trademark or other intellectual property right, violate any third-party\u2019s rights of privacy or publicity, violate any U.S. law, be defamatory or libelous, or be pornographic or obscene. We offer our customers indemnification at amounts ranging from $10,000 to $250,000, with exceptions for certain products for which our indemnification obligations are uncapped, for direct damages attributable to our breach of the express representations and warranties contained in our license agreements. However, our contractual maximum liability may not be enforceable in all jurisdictions. The aggregate amount of capped indemnification liability, or the amount of uncapped indemnification liability in individual instances, may be significant. Any customers who seek indemnification claims from us may also discontinue use of our products and services, which could harm our business.\nWe are also subject to many federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations related to rights of publicity, rights of privacy, content regulation and intellectual property and we rely on common-law frameworks in order to provide content to our customers. These laws, regulations and frameworks are constantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended in a manner that could seriously harm our business. However, these legal frameworks are subject to uncertain judicial interpretation and regulatory and legislative amendments. If the rules around these laws, regulations and doctrines change, if international jurisdictions refuse to apply similar protections, or if a court were to disagree with our application of those rules to our customers\u2019 use of content, we and our customers could become subject to third-party claims and we could become subject to significant indemnification liability.\nWhile we maintain insurance policies to cover potential intellectual property disputes and have not historically incurred any material financial liability as a result of these indemnification obligations individually or in the aggregate, we have incurred, and will expect to continue to incur, expenses related to such claims and related settlements, which may increase over time. If a third-party infringement claim or series of claims is brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage or for uninsured liabilities, our business could suffer. In addition, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us against all losses.\nFurther, unauthorized parties have attempted, and may in the future attempt, to improperly use the digital content in our collection and such misuse of our content may result in lost revenue and increase our risk of litigation. While we have proactively enforced our intellectual property rights, preventing misuse or infringement of our content is inherently difficult and we rely on intellectual property laws and contractual restrictions to protect our rights and the digital content in our collection. Certain countries may be very lax in enforcing intellectual property laws or have very onerous and time-consuming requirements to enforce intellectual property rights. Litigation in those countries will likely be costly and ineffective. Consequently, these intellectual property laws afford us only limited protection. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to prevent the unauthorized use of our digital content or that we will be successful in stopping such use once it is detected.\nRegardless of their merit, intellectual property and indemnification claims are time-consuming, expensive to litigate or settle and cause significant diversion of management attention and could severely harm our financial condition and reputation, and adversely affect our business.\nTechnological interruptions that impair access to our web properties or the efficiency of our marketplace could damage our reputation and brand and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our web properties and our network infrastructure are critical to our reputation, our ability to attract and retain customers and contributors to our platform and our ability to maintain adequate customer service levels. Any system interruptions that result in the unavailability of our websites could result in negative publicity, damage our reputation and brand or adversely affect our results of operations. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience temporary system interruptions for a variety of reasons, including security breaches and other security incidents, viruses, telecommunication and other network failures, power failures, programming errors, undetected bugs, design faults, data corruption, denial-of-service attacks, poor scalability or network overload from an overwhelming number of visitors trying to reach our websites at the same time. Even a disruption as brief as a few minutes could have a negative impact on our marketplace activities and could result in a loss of revenue.\nBecause some of the causes of system interruptions may be outside of our control, we may not be able to remedy such interruptions in a timely manner, or at all. In addition, we have entered into service level agreements with some of our larger customers and strategic partners. Technological interruptions could result in a breach of such agreements and subject us to considerable penalties and could cause our customers to believe our service is unreliable, causing harm to our business, reputation and financial condition.\nWe rely on information technologies and systems to operate our business and maintain our competitiveness, and any failures in our technology infrastructure could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems, including technology and systems used for our platform and apps, customer service, invoicing and billing, communications, fraud detection and administration. As our operations grow in size, scope and complexity, we will need to continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of consumer-enhanced services, features and functionalities, while maintaining and improving the reliability, security and integrity of our systems and infrastructure.\nOur future success also depends on our ability to adapt our services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve our platform\u2019s performance, features and reliability. We may not be able to maintain our existing systems or replace our current systems or introduce new technologies and systems quickly or cost effectively. Failure to invest in and adapt to technological developments and industry trends may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe rely upon third-party service providers, such as co-location and cloud service providers, for our data centers and application hosting, and we are dependent on these third parties to provide continuous power, cooling, internet connectivity and physical security for our servers, and our reliance on these third-parties can be expected to increase as we expand our infrastructure in the future. In the event that these third-party providers experience any interruption in operations or cease business for any reason, or if we are unable to agree on satisfactory terms for continued hosting relationships, our business could be harmed and we could be forced to enter into a relationship with other service providers or assume hosting responsibilities ourselves. Although our use of multiple production data centers enables us to provide rapid content delivery to our customers and are intended to mitigate the risks associated with supporting business continuity in the event of an emergency, a system disruption at an active data center or third-party hosting service provider could result in a noticeable disruption and performance degradation to our websites.\nFurther, our technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer intrusions, vulnerabilities and viruses, software errors, computer denial-of-service attacks and other events. A significant number of the systems making up this infrastructure are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for every eventuality. Our technology infrastructure may fail or be vulnerable to damage or interruption because of actions by third parties or employee error or malfeasance. We may not carry\nbusiness interruption insurance sufficient to protect us from any and all losses that may result from interruptions in our services as a result of technology infrastructure failures or to cover all contingencies. Any interruption in the availability of our websites and on-line interactions with customers or partners may cause a reduction in customer or partner satisfaction levels, which in turn could cause additional claims, reduced revenue or loss of customers or partners. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, a loss of customers, loss of confidence in the stability and reliability of our platform, damage to our reputation, and legal liability, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nUnless we increase market awareness of our brand and our existing and new products and services, our revenue may not continue to grow.\nWe believe that the brand identity that we have developed has significantly contributed to the success of our products and services and that our ability to attract and retain new customers and contributors depends in large part on our ability to increase our brand awareness. We have and may continue to expend significant resources on advertising, marketing, and other brand-building efforts to preserve and enhance customer and contributor awareness of our brand, products and services. We also have incurred and expect to incur significant costs in developing and marketing new products to obtain user acceptance and we may not be successful in our efforts to increase awareness and market share of these products. Our competitors may be able to achieve and maintain brand awareness and market share more quickly and effectively than we can.\nOur brand may be impaired by a number of factors, including the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, disruptions in service due to technology, data privacy and security issues, and exploitation of our trademarks and other intellectual property by others without our permission. Maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to be a leading platform for high-quality digital content, tools and services for creative professionals and to continue to provide a user experience that anticipates our customers\u2019 needs. Additionally, our marketing campaigns or other efforts to increase our brand awareness may not succeed in bringing new visitors to our platform or converting such visitors to paying customers or contributors and may not be cost-effective. It is possible that, as our industry becomes increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brand may become increasingly difficult and expensive and our efforts may not be successful.\nWe may not continue to grow our revenues at historical rates.\nOur future profitability will depend in part on our continued ability to grow our revenues; however, we have seen a deceleration in our growth rate, which may continue, and we may not even be able to grow at all. In future periods, our revenue could grow more slowly than in recent periods or further decline for many reasons, including any increase in competition, reduction in demand for our products, inability to introduce new products or enhance our existing product offerings, pricing pressures, contraction of our overall market or our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities. In addition, while we plan to manage our growth in a cost-effective manner, we expect expenses to increase in the near term, particularly as we continue to make significant investments in our technology and operational infrastructure, continue to expand our operations globally and develop new products and features for, and enhancements of, our existing products. A significant decrease in our historical rate of growth may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Further, if our growth rate declines, investors\u2019 perceptions of our business may be adversely affected, and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nAssertions by third parties of infringement of intellectual property rights related to our technology could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business and operating results.\nInternet, technology and media companies are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights or rights related to their use of technology. Some internet, technology and media companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, which they may use to assert claims against us. Our technology is critical to our business and we have developed proprietary technology and a robust infrastructure to power our products and services. Third parties may in the future assert that the technology we have developed infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates their intellectual property rights, and as we face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. Such litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue, and therefore our own issued and pending patents may provide little or no deterrence to these patent owners in bringing intellectual property rights claims against us. Existing laws and regulations are evolving and subject to different interpretations, and various federal and state legislative or regulatory bodies may expand current or enact new laws or regulations. We cannot guarantee that our technology is not infringing or violating any third-party intellectual property rights or rights related to use of technology.\nWe cannot predict whether assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or any infringement or misappropriation or other claims arising from such assertions will substantially harm our business and operating results. If we are forced to defend against any infringement or misappropriation claims, whether they are with or without merit, are settled out of court, or are determined in our favor, we may be required to expend significant time and financial resources on the defense of such claims.\nFurthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party\u2019s intellectual property; expend additional development resources to redesign our technology; enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies, content, or materials; and to indemnify our partners and other third parties. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required or desirable, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may require significant royalty payments and other expenditures. In addition, any lawsuits regarding intellectual property rights, regardless of their success, could be expensive to resolve and would divert the time and attention of our management and technical personnel.\nOur international operations and our continued expansion internationally expose us to many risks.\nRevenues derived from customers outside of the United States comprise a significant portion of our revenues and we seek to expand our international operations to attract customers and contributors in countries other than the United States as a critical element of our business strategy. For each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, approximately two-thirds of our revenue, respectively, was derived from customers located outside of the United States. While a significant portion of our customers reside outside of the United States, we have limited experience operating as a company outside the United States. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to international expansion through, for example, the possibility of establishing additional offices, hiring additional overseas personnel, entering into strategic arrangements with local partners, and exploring acquisition opportunities. In addition, we expect to increase marketing for our foreign language offerings and to further localize our collection and user experience for foreign markets. Our ability to expand our business and attract talented employees, as well as customers and contributors, in an increasing number of international markets requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the challenges of supporting a growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems, regulatory systems and commercial infrastructures. If we fail to deploy, manage or oversee our international operations successfully, our business may suffer.\nAdditionally, expanding our international focus may subject us to risks that we have not faced before or increase risks that we currently face, including risks associated with:\n\u2022\nmodifying our technology and marketing and localizing our offerings for customers\u2019 and contributors\u2019 preferences, customs and language;\n\u2022\nlegal, political or systemic restrictions on the ability of U.S. companies to do business in foreign countries, including, among others, restrictions imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on the ability of U.S. companies to do business in certain specified foreign countries or with certain specified organizations and individuals;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws in other jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ncompliance with foreign laws and regulations, including with respect to disclosure requirements, privacy, consumer and data protection, marketing restrictions, human rights, rights of publicity, intellectual property, technology and content;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulation of e-commerce and other services and restrictive governmental actions on the distribution of content, such as censorship;\n\u2022\ndisturbances in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political, economic or military conditions, including potential sanctions (e.g., civil, political and economic conditions in markets including but not limited to Russia, Ukraine and the Crimean peninsula);\n\u2022\nlower levels of consumer spending in foreign countries or lack of adoption of the internet as a medium of commerce;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for our or our contributors\u2019 intellectual property rights in certain countries;\n\u2022\nlaws that grant rights that may conflict with our business operations;\n\u2022\nenhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing, developing, managing and overseeing foreign operations as a result of travel distance, language and cultural differences as well as infrastructure, human resources and legal compliance costs;\n\u2022\ndifficulty enforcing contractual rights in our license agreements;\n\u2022\npotential adverse foreign tax consequences, especially those that may result from the expected proactive global development of greater efforts to identify, capture and subject to income and transactional tax, e-commerce revenue earned solely via the internet;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange fluctuations, hyperinflation, or devaluation;\n\u2022\nstrains on our financial and other systems to properly administer VAT, withholdings, sales and other taxes; and\n\u2022\nhigher costs associated with doing business internationally.\nThese risks may make it impossible or prohibitively expensive to expand to new international markets, or delay entry into such markets, which may affect our ability to grow our business. As international e-commerce and other online and web services grow, competition is expected to intensify and local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer. If we do not effectively enter new international markets, our competitive advantage may be harmed.\nThe potential effects of the U.K. voters\u2019 decision to exit the European Union may negatively impact our operations.\nOn March 29, 2019, the United Kingdom (the \u201cU.K.\u201d) is scheduled to withdraw from the European Union (E.U.), commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d pursuant to a July 2016 referendum in which Brexit was approved by U.K. voters. The terms of the withdrawal are subject to ongoing negotiation that has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. In particular, a November 2018 draft Withdrawal Agreement establishing Brexit terms negotiated by the U.K. and the E.U. was rejected by the U.K. Parliament on January 15, 2019. A withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. with no agreement or \u201chard Brexit,\u201d would exacerbate this uncertainty and would likely have adverse effects on labor and trade and result in increased currency volatility.\nIn 2018, sales to customers in the United Kingdom accounted for approximately 8% of our total revenue and sales to customers in Europe, including the United Kingdom, accounted for approximately 33% of our total revenue. The impact of Brexit on the our business will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations. It is possible that economic activity in the U.K. and the E.U. will be adversely impacted and that there will be increased regulatory and legal complexities, including those relating to tax, trade, security and employees. Such changes could be costly and potentially disruptive to our operations and business relationships in these markets. In addition, Brexit could lead to economic uncertainty and instability, including significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rates, that may adversely impact our business or that of our customers. Currency volatility could weaken the British pound, decreasing income from our U.K. operations translated to dollars as well as decreasing the profitability of our U.K. operations. Any of these effects of Brexit, among others, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe are subject to foreign exchange risk.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had operations based in a number of territories outside of the United States and a significant portion of our business may be transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the euro, the British pound, the Australian dollar and the Japanese yen. Because our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in the value of the euro, British pound, Australian dollar, Japanese yen and other currencies against the U.S. dollar have had and will continue to have a significant effect on our reported financial results. Exchange rates have been volatile in recent years and such volatility may persist due to economic and political circumstances.\nA decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies in which we receive revenues, including the euro, British pound, Australian dollar and Japanese yen, against the U.S. dollar will tend to reduce our reported revenues and expenses, while an increase in the value of any such foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar will tend to increase our reported revenues and expenses. Variations in exchange rates can significantly affect the comparability of our financial results between financial periods. As we further expand our international operations, our exposure to foreign exchange risk will increase.\nAt this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in order to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. It is difficult to predict the impact hedging activities would have on our results of operations and any future actions we may take with respect to hedging our foreign currency exchange risk may be unsuccessful.\nWe have experienced significant growth in recent periods and if we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business and operating results may suffer.\nWe have experienced significant growth and may continue to experience such growth. For example, our revenues increased from $494.3 million in 2016 to $557.1 million in 2017 and to $623.3 million in 2018. The pace of this growth has placed, and we expect that the pace of future growth will continue to place, significant demands on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth\neffectively. As our operations have grown in size, scope and complexity, we have made and expect to continue to make significant expenditures and allocate valuable management resources to improve and upgrade our technology, customer service, sales and marketing infrastructure and product offerings, including new product offerings, and to continue developing or acquiring new and relevant content and product offerings. Growth may also strain our ability to maintain reliable operation of our platform, enhance our operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and recruit, train and retain highly skilled personnel. If we fail to effectively allocate our limited resources within our organization as it grows and do not successfully implement improved technology and infrastructure, our business, operating results and financial condition may suffer.\nAs the portion of our sales to large corporate customers grows, we may encounter greater pricing pressure, and increased service, indemnification and working capital requirements, each of which could increase our costs and harm our business and operating results.\nIn order to continue to attract and retain customers, particularly larger corporate customers, we may face greater demands in terms of increased service requirements, greater indemnification requirements, greater pricing pressure, and greater working capital to accommodate the larger receivables and collections issues that are likely to occur as a result of being paid on credit terms. If we are unable to adequately address those demands or manage our resources, our ability to grow our business may be harmed, which may adversely affect our results of operations and future growth. If we address those demands in a way that expands our risk of indemnification claims, significantly increases our operating costs, reduces our ability to maintain or increase pricing, or increases our working capital requirements, our business, operating results and financial condition may suffer.\nExpansion of our operations into new products, services and technologies, including content categories, is inherently risky and may subject us to additional business, legal, financial and competitive risks.\nHistorically, our operations have been focused on our marketplace for content. Further expansion of our operations and our marketplace into additional content categories, such as Shutterstock Editorial or into new products and services, such as Shutterstock Custom, a provider of custom visual content we acquired in July 2017, or our workflow tools, such as Shutterstock Editor and Shutterstock Editor Pro, involves numerous risks and challenges, including increased capital requirements, increased marketing spend to gain brand awareness of these new operations, potential new competitors, and the need to develop new contributor and strategic relationships. Growth into additional content, product and service areas may require changes to our existing business model and cost structure and modifications to our infrastructure and may expose us to new regulatory and legal risks, any of which may require expertise in which we have little or no experience. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue from sales of such content, products and services to offset the costs of developing, acquiring, managing and monetizing such content, products and services and our business may be adversely affected.\nGovernment regulation of the internet, both in the United States and abroad, is evolving and unfavorable changes could have a negative impact on our business.\nThe adoption, modification or interpretation of laws or regulations relating to the internet, e-commerce or other areas of our business could adversely affect how we conduct our business or the overall popularity and growth of internet use. Such laws and regulations may cover a vast array of activities. For example, automatic contract or subscription renewal, credit card fraud and processing, sales, advertising, taxation, tariffs, data privacy, management and storage, cybersecurity, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts, consumer protection, outsourcing, broadband residential internet access, internet neutrality and the characteristics and quality of products or services, and intellectual property ownership and infringement are all subject to jurisdictional laws and regulations. In certain countries, including European jurisdictions in particular, certain of these laws may be more restrictive than in the United States. It is not clear how some existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, data privacy and security apply to the internet and e-commerce as many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the internet or e-commerce.\nThose laws that relate to the internet are at various stages of development and are subject to amendment, interpretation or repeal by the courts and agencies, and thus, the scope and reach of their applicability can be uncertain. For example, in 2010, California\u2019s Automatic Renewal Law went into effect, requiring companies to adhere to enhanced disclosure requirements when entering into automatically renewing contracts with consumers. Several other states have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, consumer protection policies or legal precedents that purport to void or substantially limit the automatic renewal provisions of consumer contracts or free or discounted trial incentives, as well. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in litigation, damage to our reputation, lost business and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, which could impact our operating results.\nBy way of additional example, effective June 2018, net neutrality regulations that prohibit blocking, degrading or prioritizing certain types of internet traffic were repealed by the Federal Communications Commission. Users who access our platform through devices such as smart phones, laptops, and tablet computers must have a high-speed Internet connection, such as Wi-Fi, 3G, or 4G, to use our services. Currently, this access is provided by telecommunications companies and Internet access service providers that have significant and increasing market power in the broadband and Internet access marketplace. The repeal of net neutrality allows telecommunications companies and internet service providers to take measures that affect their customers\u2019 ability to use our products and services, such as degrading the quality of the data packets we transmit over their lines, giving our packets low priority, giving other packets higher priority than ours, blocking our packets entirely, or attempting to charge their customers more for using our products and services. To the extent that Internet service providers implement usage-based pricing, including meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks, we could incur greater operating expenses and customer acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, to the extent network operators were to create tiers of Internet access service and either charge us or their customers for availability of our services through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.\nCompliance with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations of existing regulations or legislation could cause us to incur additional expenses, make it more difficult to renew subscriptions automatically, require us to display specific disclaimers, require us to obtain consent from users for certain activities, make it more difficult to attract new customers, require us to implement costly security or other measures before users can utilize our services, or otherwise require us to alter our business model, or cause us to divert resources and funds to address government or private investigatory or adversarial proceedings. Further, the law related to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users is currently unsettled both within the United States and abroad. Claims may also be threatened against us for aiding and abetting, defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other reasons based on the nature and content of information that we collect or use, or to or from which we provide links or that may be posted online. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe collect, store, process and use personally identifiable information and other data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, information security and data protection. Any cybersecurity breaches or our actual or perceived failure to comply with such legal obligations by us, or by our third-party service providers or partners, could harm our business.\nWe currently provide content licensing to customers in more than 150 countries and license content from contributors located in over 100 countries. In connection with providing content licensing, we collect, store, process and use our customers\u2019 and contributors\u2019 personally identifiable information and other data, and we rely on third parties that are not directly under our control to do so as well. We also collect, store, process and use our employees\u2019 personally identifiable information and other data in connection with their employment. While we take measures intended to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the personal information and other sensitive information we collect, store or transmit, we cannot guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur, or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information. There have been a number of recent reported incidents where third-party service providers or partners have used software to access the personal data of their customers\u2019 or partners\u2019 customers for marketing and other purposes. While our privacy policies prohibit such activities, our third-party service providers or partners may engage in such activity without our knowledge or consent. If we or our third-party service providers or partners were to experience a cybersecurity incident, data breach or disruption, unauthorized access or failure of systems compromising our customers\u2019, contributors\u2019 or employees\u2019 data, or if one of our third-party service providers or partners were to access our customers\u2019 personal data without authorization, our brand and reputation could be adversely affected, use of our products could decrease, we could experience business interruption and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation and regulatory proceedings. Depending on the nature of the information compromised in a cybersecurity incident, data breach or disruption or unauthorized access or failure of systems compromising our customers\u2019, contributors\u2019 or employees\u2019 data, we may also have obligations to notify customers, contributors, employees or governmental bodies about the incident and we may need to provide some form of remedy and compensation for the individuals affected. Complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs, including compliance, crisis management and remediation costs, and receive negative publicity. While we maintain insurance coverage that is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the event we experience a cybersecurity incident, data breach, disruption, unauthorized access or failure of systems.\nRegulatory scrutiny of privacy, data collection, use of data and data protection is intensifying both within the United States and globally. The personal information and other data we collect, store, process and use is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, especially in Europe. These laws often develop in ways we cannot predict and some laws may be in conflict with one another. This may significantly increase our cost of doing business, particularly as we expand our localization efforts. For example, GDPR, which came into effect in the E.U. in May 2018 and superseded prior E.U. data protection legislation, imposes more stringent data protection requirements and provides\nfor greater penalties for noncompliance. Further, the United Kingdom has initiated the formal process to leave the E.U., creating uncertainty with regard to the regulation of data protection in the United Kingdom. In particular, it is unclear how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated and whether or not the United Kingdom will receive an adequacy decision from the European Commission permitting cross-border data transfer prior to leaving the E.U. Additionally, although we are making use of the E.U. Standard Contractual Clauses with regard to the transfer of certain personal data to countries outside the European Economic Area (the \u201cEEA\u201d), some regulatory uncertainty remains surrounding the future of data transfers from the EEA to the United States. We also rely on the E.U.-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks, respectively, that provide a mechanism for companies to legally transfer personal data from the E.U. and Switzerland to the U.S. However, these frameworks as well as other personal data transfer mechanisms face a number of legal challenges, both by regulators and private parties. Several other foreign jurisdictions, such as Brazil, where a new General Data Privacy Law that imposes detailed rules for the collection, use, processing and storage of personal data in Brazil was signed into law in August 2018, and India, where in July 2018 a committee formed by the Indian government issued a report and draft data protection bill that has been submitted for consideration to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, have adopted or are considering adopting new or updated comprehensive privacy legislation to offer additional data privacy protections for individuals. Although we are closely monitoring regulatory developments in this area, any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with any regulatory requirements or orders or other domestic or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others (e.g., class action litigation), subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase our costs and adversely affect our business.\nData protection legislation is also becoming increasingly common in the United States at both the federal and state level. For example, in June 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which will come into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. However, legislators have stated that they intend to propose amendments to the CCPA, and it remains unclear what, if any, modifications will be made to the CCPA or how it will be interpreted. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The scope and interpretation of data privacy and cybersecurity regulations continues to evolve, and we believe that the adoption of increasingly restrictive regulations in this area is likely in the near future within the U.S. at both state and federal levels. The burdens imposed by the CCPA and other similar laws that may be enacted at the federal and state level may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs in order to comply.\nFurther, we may be or become subject to data localization laws mandating that data collected in a foreign country be processed and stored only within that country. Russia adopted such a law in 2014, and, in 2018, India introduced a bill requiring local storage of all personal data of Indian data principals. Such data localization requirements may have cost implications for us, impact our ability to utilize the efficiencies and value of our global network, and could affect our strategy. Further, if other countries in which we have customers were to adopt data localization laws, we could be required to expand our data storage facilities there or build new ones in order to comply. The expenditure this would require, as well as costs of ongoing compliance, could harm our financial condition.\nCybersecurity breaches and improper access to or disclosure of data or confidential information we maintain, or hacking or phishing attacks on our systems, could expose us to liability, protracted and costly litigation and damage our reputation.\nAs a global technology business, we and our third-party service providers collect and maintain confidential information and personal data about our employees, customers, contributors and other third parties, in connection with marketplace-related processes on our websites and, in particular, in connection with processing and remitting payments to and from our customers and contributors, and we are therefore exposed to security and fraud-related risks, which are likely to become more challenging as we expand our operations. We also rely heavily on our networks, and on the networks of third-party service providers for the secure storage, processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information and generally to conduct our business. Although we maintain security features on our websites and utilize encryption and authentication technology, our cybersecurity measures may not detect or prevent all attempts, whether intentional or unintentional, to hack our systems, denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, phishing attacks, ransomware, other social engineering attacks, cybersecurity breaches or other attacks and disruptions that may jeopardize our networks and the security of information stored in and transmitted by our networks and websites.\nWe use third-party service providers, including payment processors and co-location and cloud service vendors for our data centers and application hosting, to operate our business, and their security measures may not prevent cybersecurity incidents and other disruptions that may jeopardize their networks and the security of information stored in and transmitted by their networks. Some of the software and services that we use to operate our business, including our internal e-mail, payment processor and customer relationship management software, are also hosted by third parties. It is possible that our security measures or the security measures of our third-party service providers might be breached due to employee error, inadequate use of cybersecurity controls by customers, contributors or employees, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, or otherwise. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in the loss of control of confidential information, disruption to our business operations and significant legal and financial exposure, as well as damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, a significant cybersecurity breach or cyber-attack could result in payment networks prohibiting us from processing transactions on their networks.\nAlthough cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of the processes, practices and controls that are designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage, disruption or unauthorized access are a high priority for us, because the techniques used to attack, damage, disrupt or obtain unauthorized access are constantly evolving in sophisticated ways to avoid detection and often are not recognized until launched against a target, our efforts may not be enough to anticipate or prevent a party from circumventing our security measures, or the security measures of our third-party service providers, and accessing and misusing the confidential information of our employees, customers and contributors. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users and customers. We may also be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against such cybersecurity incidents to alleviate problems caused by such incidents. While we continually work to safeguard our internal network systems and validate the security of our third-party providers, to mitigate these potential risks, including through information security policies and employee awareness and training, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber-attacks or cybersecurity breaches. Any actual or perceived breach or the perceived threat of a breach, could cause our customers, contributors and other third parties to cease doing business with us, or subject us to lawsuits, regulatory fines, criminal penalties, statutory damages, and other costs, including for provision of breach notices and credit monitoring to our customers, and other action or liability, and could lead to business interruption, any of which could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAction by governments to restrict access to, or operation of, our products or services in their countries could substantially harm our business and financial results.\nForeign governments, or internet service providers acting pursuant to foreign government policies or orders, of one or more countries may seek to censor content available through our e-commerce platform in their country, restrict access to our products and services from their country entirely, or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products or services in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely if our products and services are deemed to be in violation of their local laws and regulations. For example, domestic internet service providers have blocked and continue to block access to Shutterstock in China and other countries, such as Turkey, have intermittently restricted access to Shutterstock. There are substantial uncertainties regarding interpretation of foreign laws and regulations that censor content available through our products and services and we may be forced to significantly change or discontinue our operations in such markets if we were to be found in violation of any new or existing law or regulation. If access to our products and services is restricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries or our competitors can successfully penetrate geographic markets that we cannot access, our ability to retain or increase our contributor and customer base may be adversely affected, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated, and our financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur operations may expose us to greater than anticipated income, non-income and transactional tax liabilities, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have operations in various taxing jurisdictions in the United States and foreign countries, and there is a risk that the fiscal authorities in one or more jurisdictions may contend that our tax liabilities and/or obligation to remit transactional taxes could be greater relative to prior taxable periods and more than anticipated relative to future taxable periods.\nWe believe our worldwide provision for taxes is reasonable, but our ultimate tax liability may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially adversely affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. We have created reserves with respect to such tax liabilities where we believe it to be appropriate. However, there can be no assurance that our ultimate tax liability will not exceed the reserves that we have created.\nIn addition, tax law and regulatory changes in the U.S., E.U. and other jurisdictions, including tax law and regulatory changes that may be impacted as a result of tax policy recommendations from organizations such as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) have and may continue to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSpecifically, the enactment of the TCJA had a significant impact on our financial statements for 2017 and 2018, and we believe may potentially have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations in future years. Certain provisions of the TCJA are likely to undergo revisions or by their terms are set to expire on certain specified future dates, unless such provisions are further modified in subsequent legislation. There continues to be unresolved questions regarding how certain provisions of the TCJA are to be interpreted and implemented. Potential regulatory and/or legislative action to address questions that have arisen or may arise because of the TCJA as well as any potential changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the TCJA could cause uncertainty with respect to the ultimate impact of the TCJA on our tax provisions.\nIn response to the TCJA, several sovereign foreign jurisdictions, as well as administrative bodies such as the E.U. and the OECD, have expressed reservations and raised concerns about certain of the provisions of the TCJA, and it is possible that formal challenges or reactionary regulatory legislation may be instituted by one or more of such foreign authorities that could ultimately adversely affect us and/or negate or minimize some or all of the favorable impacts that we have or may derive from the TCJA.\nThere is also heightened scrutiny by fiscal authorities in virtually every sovereign foreign jurisdiction on the potential taxation of e-commerce businesses. The OECD has issued guidelines, referred to as the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project, or BEPS, to its member-nations aimed at encouraging broad-based legislative initiatives intended to prevent perceived base erosion transactions and income shifting in a tax-advantaged manner. Further, for the past several years, the OECD has also had a specific focus on the taxation implications of e-commerce business and is expected to issue final report on jurisdictional taxation of e-commerce business in the next several years. Any effort to implement any expanded policies to tax e-commerce businesses, whether driven by the OECD\u2019s final report and recommendation, or any efforts by foreign jurisdictions in advance of the OECD\u2019s final report, may be uncoordinated and result in greater or even double taxation that companies may not have sufficient means to remedy. Efforts to alleviate this increased tax burden may increase the cost of structuring and compliance as well as the cost of doing business internationally. Any changes to the taxation of our international activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.\nFurther, the prospective taxation by multiple jurisdictions of e-commerce businesses could subject us to exposure to withholding, sales and/or other transaction taxes on our past and future transactions in such jurisdictions where we currently or in the future may be required to report taxable transactions. A successful assertion by any jurisdiction that we failed to pay such withholding, sales or other transaction taxes, or the imposition of new laws requiring the registration for, collection of, and payment of such taxes, could result in substantial tax liabilities related to past and future sales, create increased administrative burdens and costs, discourage customers from purchasing digital content from us, or otherwise substantially harm our business and results of operations. We are currently subject to and in the future may become subject to additional compliance requirements for certain of these taxes. Where appropriate, we have made accruals for these taxes, which are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Changes in the estimates or assumptions underlying these accruals could have an adverse impact on our financial condition in the future.\nLastly, in June 2018, the Supreme Court of the United States (the \u201cSupreme Court\u201d) issued its decision in the matter of South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. This decision effectively reversed the 25-year-old \u201cphysical presence doctrine\u201d previously established by the Supreme Court in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, which required a minimum level of physical presence within a state before the state could impose an obligation to register and remit sales tax on revenue derived within that state. Since the decision, a number of states have enacted sales tax enabling legislation which has had the effect of significantly expanding the liability of e-commerce companies to register, collect and remit state sales taxes from customers. We are in the process of registering for, and collecting sales tax in a number of states. We are in the process of determining how and when our collection practices will need to change in the relevant states and have already registered for and are collecting sales tax in several states. We are also evaluating the impact, if any, of the imposition of sales tax on customer demand for our products, or our realized revenue. However, we anticipate that this decision will significantly increase the costs associated with the collection and compliance burden on us.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nWe regard our patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and our other intellectual property rights as critical to our success. We rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection, and non-disclosure agreements and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered or applied to register \u201cShutterstock\u201d, \u201cOffset\u201d, \u201cBigstock\u201d, \u201cPremiumBeat,\u201d \u201cRex Features\u201d and \u201cShutterstock Editor\u201d and associated logos and other marks as trademarks in the United States and other jurisdictions and we are the registered owner of the shutterstock.com, bigstock.com, offset.com, premiumbeat.com and rexfeatures.com internet domain names and various other related domain names. Effective intellectual property protection for our trademarks and domain names may not be available or practical in every country in which we operate or intend to operate.\nDespite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights and trade secrets, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our intellectual property, trade secrets and other confidential information, or adopt domain names, trademarks or service names confusingly similar to ours. In order to protect our trade secrets and other confidential information, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of misappropriation of trade secrets or any unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets or other confidential information.\nPolicing our intellectual property rights is difficult, costly and may not always be effective. Litigation or proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our patent rights, trademarks, trade secrets and domain names and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others is and will be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. The monitoring and protection of our intellectual property rights may become more difficult, costly and time consuming as we continue to expand internationally, particularly in certain markets, such as China and certain other developing countries in Asia, in which legal protection of intellectual property rights is less robust than in the United States and Europe. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management time, each of which could substantially harm our operating results.\nMuch of the software and technologies used to provide our services incorporate, or have been developed with, \u201copen source\u201d software, which may restrict how we use or distribute our services or require that we publicly release certain portions of our source code.\nMuch of the software and technologies used to provide our services incorporate, or have been developed with, \u201copen source\u201d software. Such \u201copen source\u201d software may be subject to third-party licenses that impose restrictions on our software and services. Examples of \u201copen source\u201d licenses include the GNU General Public License and GNU Lesser General Public License. Such open source licenses typically require that source code subject to the license be made available to the public and that any modifications or derivative works to open source software continue to be licensed under open source licenses. Few courts have interpreted open source licenses, and the way these licenses may be interpreted and enforced is therefore subject to some uncertainty. If portions of our proprietary technology are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our technologies, or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our technologies, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our services and technologies and materially and adversely affect our ability to sustain and grow our business. If an author or other third-party that distributes open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the sale of our services that contained the open source software and required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of some of our services.\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which could cause our results to fall short of expectations and our stock price to decline.\nOur revenue and operating results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period to period basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\n\u2022\nour ability to retain our current customers and to attract new customers and contributors;\n\u2022\nour ability to provide new and relevant content to our customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively manage our growth;\n\u2022\nthe effects of increased competition on our business;\n\u2022\nour ability to keep pace with changes in technology or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u2022\ninterruptions in service, whether or not we are responsible for such interruptions, and any related impact on our reputation and brand;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with defending any litigation or other claims, including those related to our indemnification of our customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to pursue, and the timing of, entry into new geographies or markets and, if pursued, our management of such expansion;\n\u2022\nthe impact of general economic conditions on our revenue and expenses;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulation affecting our business; and\n\u2022\ncosts related to potential acquisitions of technology or businesses.\nBecause of these risks and others, it is possible that our future results may be below our expectations and the expectations of analysts and investors. In such an event, the price of our common stock may decline significantly.\nIf we do not successfully make, integrate and maintain acquisitions and investments, our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe have acquired, invested in and entered into strategic relationships with companies, and we may acquire, invest in or enter into strategic relationships with additional companies to complement our existing business and the breadth of our offerings. These transactions are inherently risky and expose us to risks which include:\n\u2022\ndisruption of our ongoing business, including diverting management\u2019s attention from existing businesses and operations;\n\u2022\nrisks inherent in launching or acquiring new products or extending our existing platform, where we have limited or no experience;\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating acquired technology and assets, including content collections, into our systems and offerings;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with any acquired liabilities;\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating personnel;\n\u2022\ninformation security vulnerabilities;\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating accounting, financial reporting, management, infrastructure and information security, human resources and other administrative and operational systems;\n\u2022\npotential impairment resulting from the recording of goodwill and intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing;\n\u2022\nthe potential damage to employee, customer, contributor and other supplier relationships; and\n\u2022\nother unknown liabilities.\nFuture acquisitions or investments could also result in potential dilutive issuances of equity securities, use of significant cash balances or the incurrence of debt, any of which could adversely affect our stock price, financial condition and results of operations. Further, our acquisitions or investments could result in significant impairments related to goodwill and amortization expenses related to other intangible assets and exposure to undisclosed or potential liabilities of the acquired companies. To the extent that the goodwill arising from the acquisitions carried on the financial statements does not pass a goodwill impairment test, excess goodwill will be impaired and will reduce future earnings.\nWe cannot make assurances that our investments will be successful. If we fail to effectively integrate the companies we acquire, invest in or enter into strategic relationships with, we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed.\nAn adverse change in the projected cash flows from our business units or the business climate in which they operate, could require us to record a goodwill impairment charge, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nWe test our goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1st, or more frequently if and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist, such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, we make assumptions regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows, discount rates, growth rates and terminal values. These assumptions take into consideration business trends, market and economic conditions and historical experience, and with respect to future cash flows, are dependent on our ability to execute on our strategy. Certain of these assumptions, particularly the discount rate, are also based on market conditions that are outside of our control. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and in applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill and intangible assets.\nAlthough we believe that we use reasonable methodologies for developing assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. Any significant adverse change regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows, terminal value growth rates and discount rates used in valuing our reporting units could require us to record an impairment charge, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain and motivate key personnel, attract qualified personnel, integrate new members of our management team or maintain our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nWe are highly dependent on the continued service and performance of our senior management team, including our Founder and Chief Executive Officer Jon Oringer, as well as key personnel. We believe that the successful performance of our senior management team and key personnel is critical to managing our operations and supporting our growth. Further, many of our technologies and systems are custom-made for our business by our personnel. The loss of any key engineering, product development, marketing or sales personnel and our inability to implement a succession plan or find suitable replacements for any of these individuals could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur continued and future success is also dependent, in part, on our ability to identify, attract, retain and motivate highly skilled technical, managerial, product development, marketing, content operations and customer service personnel and to preserve the key aspects of our corporate culture. Competition for qualified personnel is intense in our industry and we may be unsuccessful in offering competitive compensation packages to attract and retain personnel. Further, we believe that a critical contributor to our success and to our recruiting efforts has been our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As we continue to pursue growth and expansion of our operations globally, we may not be able to maintain our corporate culture, which could impact our ability to attract and retain personnel. We are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. Changes to immigration policies in the U.S. and other key jurisdictions that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately recruit and retain key employees. The failure to successfully recruit and hire key personnel or the loss of any key personnel could have a significant impact on our operations and growth.\nWe may be exposed to risks related to our use of independent contractors.\nWe rely on independent third parties to provide certain services for our Company. The state of the law regarding independent contractor status varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is subject to change based on court decisions and regulation. For example, on April 30, 2018, the California Supreme Court adopted a new standard for determining whether a company \u201cemploys\u201d or is the \u201cemployer\u201d for purposes of the California Wage Orders in its decision in the Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v. Superior Court case. The Dynamex decision alters the analysis of whether an individual, who is classified by a hiring entity as an independent contractor in California, has been properly classified as an independent contractor. Under the new test, an individual is considered an employee under the California Wage Orders unless the hiring entity establishes three criteria: (i) the worker is free from the control and direction of the hirer in connection with the performance of the work, both under the contract for the performance of such work and in fact; (ii) the worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business; and (iii) the worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work performed for the hiring entity.\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in lawsuits and claims that assert that certain independent contractors should be classified as our employees. Adverse determinations regarding the status of any of our independent contractors could, among other things, entitle such individuals to the reimbursement of certain expenses and to the benefit of wage-and-hour laws, and could result in the Company being liable for employment and withholding tax and benefits for such individuals. Any such adverse determination could result in a material reduction of the number of subcontractors we can use for our business or significantly increase our costs to serve our customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe impact of worldwide economic and political conditions, including effects on advertising and marketing budgets, may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nGlobal economic and political conditions can affect the business of our customers and the markets they serve. Numerous external forces beyond our control, including generally weak or uncertain economic conditions, negative or uncertain political climates, changes in government and election results in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate, could adversely affect our financial condition. Particularly, our financial condition is affected by worldwide economic conditions and their impact on advertising spending. Expenditures by advertisers generally tend to reflect overall economic conditions, and to the extent that the economy stagnates, companies may reduce their spending on advertising and marketing, and thus the use of our platform. This could have a serious adverse impact on our business. To the extent that overall economic conditions reduce spending on advertising and marketing activities, our ability to retain current and obtain new customers could be hindered, which could reduce our revenue and negatively impact our business. In addition, if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes and our business could be negatively affected.\nThe non-payment or late payments of amounts due to us from certain customers may negatively impact our financial condition.\nOur revenue generated through sales to enterprise customers has grown in recent years and represented approximately 41% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to approximately 37% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. A portion of these customers typically purchase our products on payment terms, and therefore we assume a credit risk for non-payment in the ordinary course of business. We evaluate the credit-worthiness of new customers and perform ongoing financial condition evaluations of our existing customers; however, there can be no assurance that our allowances for uncollected accounts receivable balances will be sufficient. As of December 31, 2018, our allowance for doubtful accounts was $4.7 million. If the volume of sales to enterprise customers continues to grow, we expect to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts primarily as the result of changes in the volume of sales to customers who pay on payment terms.\nWe are subject to payment-related risks that may result in higher operating costs or the inability to process payments, either of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit cards and debit cards. As we offer new payment options to consumers, we may be subject to additional regulations, compliance requirements and fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards and debit cards, and it could disrupt our business if these companies became unwilling or unable to provide these services to us, including if they were to suffer a cyberattack or security incident. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments. Under current credit card practices, we are liable for fraudulent credit card transactions because we do not obtain cardholders\u2019 signatures. We do not currently carry insurance against this risk. Although we have historically experienced minimal impact to our financial statements from credit card fraud, we may experience expense as a result of our failure to adequately control fraudulent credit.\nWe are also subject to, or voluntarily comply with, several other laws and regulations relating to money laundering, international money transfers, privacy and information security and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease our operations.\nCatastrophic events or other interruptions or failures of our information technology systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.\nOur computers and other technological systems, as well as our data centers and the computers, systems and data centers of our third-party service providers, could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and other similar events or disruptions. Our principal executive offices are located in New York City, a region that has experienced acts of terrorism in the past. Any one of these events could cause system interruption, delays and loss of critical data and could prevent our websites, e-commerce platform and infrastructure from functioning effectively, if at all. Our systems may not be adequately designed with the necessary reliability and redundancy to avoid performance delays or outages. Any insufficiency in our redundancy or disaster recovery capabilities could make our products and service offerings less attractive, subject us to liability and could be harmful to our business. In addition, we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related loss. Any of these events could damage our reputation and cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future and may be unable to do so on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business needs, opportunities and challenges, including the need to develop new features or functions of our platform, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses, personnel and technologies, or develop and carry out a response to unforeseen circumstances. Our ability to obtain additional capital, if and when required, will depend on our business plans, investor demand, our operating performance, the condition of the capital markets, and other factors. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. If we are unable to obtain additional capital when required, or are unable to obtain additional capital on satisfactory terms, our ability to continue to support our business growth or to respond to business opportunities, challenges, or unforeseen circumstances could be adversely affected, and our business may be harmed.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate substantially. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in 2012 at a price of $17.00 per share, the reported high and low sales prices per share of our common stock have ranged from $21.00 to $103.01 through February 22, 2019. These fluctuations could cause our stockholders to lose all or part of their investment in our common stock since they may be unable to sell their shares at or above the price at which they purchased such shares.\nThe trading price of our common stock depends on a number of factors, including those described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in projected operational and financial results;\n\u2022\nannouncements about our share repurchase program, including purchases or the suspension of purchases under the program;\n\u2022\nissuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nthe use by investors or analysts of third-party data regarding our business that may not reflect our actual performance;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors or analysts to be comparable to us;\n\u2022\nthe financial guidance we may provide to the public, any changes in such guidance, or our failure to meet such guidance;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key senior management;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nlimited \u201cpublic float\u201d in the hands of a small number of investors whose sales (or lack of sales) could result in positive or negative pricing pressure on the market price for our common stock; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\nFurthermore, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. In the past, certain companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their common stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nJonathan Oringer, our founder, chairman and chief executive officer, owns and controls approximately 46.1% of our outstanding shares of common stock, and his ownership percentage may increase, including as a result of share repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase program. This concentration of ownership may have an effect on matters requiring the approval of our stockholders, including elections to our board of directors and transactions that are otherwise favorable to our stockholders.\nAs of February 22, 2019, Jonathan Oringer, our founder, chairman and chief executive officer, and our largest stockholder, owned approximately 46.1% of our outstanding shares of common stock. This concentration of ownership may delay, deter or prevent a change in control, and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible to complete without the support of Mr. Oringer, regardless of the impact of such transaction on our other stockholders. Additionally, Mr. Oringer has the ability to control management and major strategic investments as a result of his position as chief executive officer.\nFurthermore, if we purchase additional shares pursuant to our share repurchase program, Mr. Oringer\u2019s ownership percentage would increase, and, depending on the magnitude of our repurchases and other factors impacting dilution, could result in his owning a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If Mr. Oringer were to own a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock, he would have the ability to control the outcome of certain matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of our directors and significant corporate transactions. This could also trigger certain change in control provisions in our employment agreements and agreements relating to certain outstanding equity awards.\nPurchases of shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program may affect the value of our common stock, and there can be no assurance that our share repurchase program will enhance stockholder value.\nPursuant to our share repurchase program which was publicly announced in November 2015, we were authorized to repurchase up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock. In February 2017, our Board authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $100 million of our outstanding common stock. We had approximately $100 million of remaining authorization for purchases under the share repurchase program as of December 31, 2018 and February 22, 2019. The timing and amount of any share repurchases will be determined based on market conditions, share price and other factors. This activity could increase (or reduce the size of any decrease in) the market price of our common stock at the time of such repurchases. Our board has the right to amend or suspend the share repurchase program at any time or terminate the share repurchase program upon a determination that termination would be in our best interests. Additionally, repurchases under our share repurchase program have diminished and would continue to diminish our cash reserves, which could impact our ability to pursue possible strategic opportunities and acquisitions and could result in lower overall returns on our cash balances. There can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value, as the market price of our common stock may nevertheless decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is likely to be influenced by the reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who covers us were to cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our share price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their common stock at a time and price that they deem appropriate.\nAs of February 22, 2019, we had 35,081,109 shares of common stock outstanding. All shares of our common stock are freely transferable without restriction or registration under the Securities Act, except for shares held by our \u201caffiliates,\u201d which remain subject to the restrictions set forth in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nAs of February 22, 2019, the holders of approximately 16 million shares of common stock were entitled to rights with respect to registration of these shares under the Securities Act pursuant to a registration rights agreement. We filed a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act covering shares of common stock issuable pursuant to options and shares reserved for future issuance under our 2012 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan and our 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Shares issued pursuant to such options and plans can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance and vesting, subject to the terms of the award agreements delivered under such plans, unless they are held by \u201caffiliates,\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 144 of the Securities Act.\nWe may also issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investment or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. Our corporate governance documents include provisions that:\n\u2022\nauthorize blank check preferred stock, which could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022\nlimit the liability of, and provide indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\nlimit the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings and to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\n\u2022\nrequire advance notice of stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors, as a result of which the successors to the directors whose terms have expired will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following their election;\n\u2022\nrequire that directors only be removed from office for cause; and\n\u2022\nlimit the determination of the number of directors on our board and the filling of vacancies or newly created seats on the board to our board of directors then in office.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without the prior approval of our board of directors and, in certain cases, the vote of two-thirds of the shares not held by such stockholder.\nThese provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law, alone or together, could delay or deter hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nThere can be no assurance that we will declare dividends in the future.\nAlthough we had not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock since our initial public offering, on August 1, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $3.00 per share (the \u201cSpecial Dividend\u201d), or approximately $104.9 million in the aggregate, which we paid to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 15, 2018.\nAny future dividend payments will be within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, contractual restrictions, anticipated cash needs, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. We may not have sufficient liquidity in the future to pay dividends on our common stock. Therefore, the return, if any, on any investment in our common stock could depend solely on an increase, if any, in the market value of our common stock.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur increased costs and our management will continue to face increased demands as a result of continuously improving our operations as a public company.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant legal, tax, insurance, accounting and other expenses as a result of conducting our operations as a public comp\nany. For example, we have continued to upgrade our financial and business processing applications to accommodate the increased volume of products and transactions resulting from our growth to date. If we experience delays or difficulties in implementing these systems, or if we otherwise do not effectively manage our growth, we may not be able to execute on our\nbusiness plan, respond to competitive pressures, take advantage of market opportunities, or satisfy customer requirements, among other things.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations implemented by the SEC and the stock exchanges are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time-consuming. We are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. Further, there may be uncertainty regarding the implementation of these laws due to changes in the political climate and other factors. Our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has required and will continue to require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs to obtain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance as a result of operating as a public company, as well as additional costs necessitated by compliance matters and ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance standards.\nAlso, the TCJA amended Section 162(m) of the U.S. federal income tax code (\u201cSection 162(m)\u201d), which provides that public companies are not entitled to a tax deduction for individual compensation over $1 million that is paid to certain executive officers. Prior to the amendment under the TCJA, Section 162(m) provided an exception to the deductibility limitations for \u201cperformance-based compensation\u201d that met certain requirements. As amended, beginning in 2018, except for certain grandfathered arrangements in place prior to November 2, 2017 under the amendment\u2019s transition rules, Section 162(m) no longer includes an exception to the limitations for \u201cperformance-based compensation\u201d and expands the group of executive officers covered by the limitation. There are certain unresolved questions regarding how the grandfathering rules are to be implemented which may impact whether certain cash and equity-based compensation awards granted to our executive officers prior to November 2, 2017 that were intended to be exempt from the Section 162(m) deduction limitations continue to be exempt under these grandfathering rules. In addition, current and future compensation we provide to our executive officers that is not otherwise covered by the grandfathering rules, will be subject to the deduction limitation rules of Section 162(m) in 2018 and going forward.\nThese and other increased costs associated with operating as a public company may decrease our net income or increase our net loss and may cause us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our products or services to offset the effect of such increased costs. Additionally, if these requirements divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting that could result in material misstatements as well as negatively impact the reliability of our financial statements. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or in a timely fashion, and we may not be able to prevent fraud; in such case, our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our reputation, our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nAs a public company, we operate in an increasingly demanding regulatory environment, which requires us to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, expanded disclosure requirements, accelerated reporting requirements and more complex accounting rules. Company responsibilities required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act include establishing and maintaining corporate oversight and adequate internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Effective internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable, timely financial reports and prevent fraud.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nDuring its evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2018, management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to the accuracy, cut-off and completeness of sales transactions related to certain enterprise license arrangements. Specifically, as our business strategy related to enterprise license arrangements changed during 2018, we did not design and maintain effective controls to assess the risks of misstatement, and therefore the appropriateness of revenue recognition, associated with product offerings outside of our standard product catalog. The control deficiencies resulted in immaterial errors in recorded revenue, accounts receivable, deferred revenue and related disclosures for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and the interim periods ended June 30, 2018 and September 30, 2018, and did not result in a material misstatement of our interim or annual consolidated financial statements or disclosures for any historical periods. Additionally, these control deficiencies could result in a misstatement of the aforementioned accounts balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim\nconsolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, our management has determined that these control deficiencies constitute a material weakness.\nIn response to the identified material weakness, management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, has taken actions to remediate the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. These actions include: (1) the creation of a project team to identify the population of enterprise product offerings outside of our standard product catalog; and (2) the development and implementation of an enhanced process, focused on the accuracy, cut-off and completeness of the remaining enterprise product offerings.\nThe material weakness will not be considered remediated until a sustained period of time has passed to allow management to test the design and operational effectiveness of the corrective actions. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that remediation will be completed in a timely manner or that the remedial measures will prevent other control deficiencies or material weaknesses. We may identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. If we are unable to remediate this material weakness or we identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to analyze, record and report financial information free of material misstatements, to prepare our financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the SEC and otherwise to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act each year will be adversely affected. The occurrence of, or failure to remediate, this material weakness and any future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may result in material misstatements as well as negatively impact the reliability of our financial statements, our reputation, our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nFurthermore, if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and results of operations could be harmed, and investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information.", "PERMNO": 13625, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "SSTK"}
