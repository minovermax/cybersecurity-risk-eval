{"cik": "932699", "company": "AMERICAN POWER GROUP Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-01-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. Investors should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report, in evaluating our Company and our business. If any of these risks, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not significant, develops into an actual event, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. If that happens, the market price of our Common Stock could decline.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur dual fuel conversion business has lost money in the last eight consecutive fiscal years and our flare gas capture and recovery business lost money since we established it in fiscal 2015. We will need additional working capital until we obtain profitability. If additional capital is not received, our business will materially and adversely be affected and we may fail.\nSince the July 2009 acquisition of American Power Group\u2019s dual fuel conversion operations, we have invested over $18 million to obtain regulatory approvals of our dual fuel products and support dual fuel sales and marketing initiatives intended to promote our dual fuel conversion technology and establish a broader market presence worldwide. Despite these efforts our dual fuel business has incurred significant operating losses and experienced negative cash flow from operations. In addition, our new division, Trident NGL Services has not been profitable since we established it.\nOur continued existence is dependent on our ability to generate positive operating cash flow, achieve profitability and generate improved performance. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, our ability to maintain our current level of operations could be materially and adversely affected. There is no guarantee we will be able to achieve profitability.\nWe require additional funding to operate and grow our business, Such funding may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all. If we do not obtain funding, our business will be materially and adversely affected and we may fail. In addition, if we have to sell securities in order to obtain financing, the rights of our current holders may be adversely affected.\nSubstantial expenditures have been required and may be required in the future to enable us to obtain the necessary additional vehicular engine family approvals from the EPA to accelerate our ability to sell our vehicular dual fuel solution in the United States. In addition, we need additional capital to continue operations. Although our Board approved a non-binding term sheet with entities related to two of our Directors and an existing shareholder to raise up to $3 million in new capital, there can be no assurance that we will obtain sufficient capital on acceptable terms, if at all, or that we will generate revenues from operations. Failure to generate such operating revenues or obtain such capital would have a material adverse impact on our financial position, our results of operations and our ability to continue as a going concern. We may also seek funding for the manufacturing and marketing of our products through strategic partnerships and other arrangements with corporate partners. There can be no assurance that such collaborative arrangements or additional funds will be available when needed, or on terms acceptable to us if at all. Operating and capital requirements during the next fiscal year and thereafter will vary based on a number of factors, including the level of sales and marketing activities for services and products. There can be no assurance that additional private or public financing, including debt or equity financing, will be available as needed, or, if available, on terms favorable to us. The Series D Preferred Stock financing was highly dilutive to stockholders and imposed substantial liquidation preferences over our existing Preferred Stock and Common Stock. The Series E 12.5% Convertible Preferred Stock financing contemplated by the term sheet is also expected to be highly dilutive to stockholders and to impose substantial liquidation preferences over our existing Preferred Stock and Common Stock. Any additional equity financing may be further dilutive to stockholders and such additional equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges that are senior to those of our existing Common Stock and/or Preferred Stock.\nImprovement in our business depends on our ability to increase demand for our products and services.\nWe must substantially increase revenues by increasing demand for our dual fuel products and services as well as our flare capture and recovery business. Factors that could limit demand for our products and services include changes in the price spread between diesel fuel and natural gas and potential additional changes in the regulatory environment. Other possible adverse circumstances may include changes in economic conditions affecting markets for our products and services, potential delays in product development, product and service flaws which could result in material warranty claims, changes in technology and the availability of competitive products and services could also delay or limit demand for our products and services. There can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful, that all of our products will prove to meet the anticipated levels of approval or effectiveness, or that we will be able to obtain and sustain customers as well as distribution approval.\nWe rely on significant customers and relationships, the loss of one or more of which could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and business prospects.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, three dual fuel vehicular customers accounted for 59% of consolidated net sales. One of the customers is a domestic vehicular Dealer/Certified Installer that focuses specifically on rebuilding Class 8 \u201cGlider\u201d tractors. A Glider is a new tractor with rebuilt or remanufactured powertrain components and in some cases can weigh 1,000 pounds less than a new tractor, making it more cost effective to operate. The second customer is a vehicular Dealer/Certified Installer located in Mexico that focuses specifically on Class 8 tractor maintenance and repair opportunities. The third is an APG direct end customer. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, one dual fuel vehicular customer accounted for 14% of consolidated net sales. This customer is a vehicular Dealer/Certified Installer that focuses specifically on Class 8 tractor maintenance and repair opportunities, but is not one of the three dual fuel customers identified above. We believe the loss of this direct end customer and the Dealer/Certified Installers would have a short term negative impact on our business.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, one oil and gas stationary customer accounted for 10% of consolidated net sales. The customer also accounted for 39% of consolidated net sales in fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. This customer is one of our stationary Dealer/Certified Installers that focuses specifically on the oil and gas industry. We believe the loss of this Dealer/Certified Installer would have a short term negative impact on our business.\nWe are exposed to risks related to technological obsolescence and competition.\nWe operate in competitive and evolving markets locally, nationally and globally. These markets are subject to technological changes and changes in demand. In seeking market acceptance of our dual fuel products, we encounter competition from many sources, including other well-established and larger dominant original equipment providers such as CAT, Cummings, Detroit Diesel, Volvo and Mercedes as well as several other companies that offer dual fuel conversion solutions on both an invasive as well as non-invasive basis. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources as well as substantially greater experience in conducting testing, manufacturing and marketing of products than we do. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies, changes in customer requirements, or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services. In both our dual fuel and flare capture and recovery businesses our competitors might succeed in developing or purchasing technologies and products that are more effective than those that we are developing or that would render our technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive. Competition could increase if new companies enter the markets in which we operate or our existing competitors expand their service lines.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights adequately.\nOur ability to compete is affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. Our dual fuel solution relies on a single licensed patent, as well as on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights. Our flare capture and recovery processing operations rely on trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite these efforts, we cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our proprietary information will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or protect that proprietary information. Companies in our industry often own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. As we gain increasing market share, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against our licensed dual fuel technology could grow. Although the owner of our licensed patent is responsible for defending all claims against the licensed dual fuel technology, it may not have the resources to defend such claims adequately. Such claims, whether having merit or otherwise, could be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management resources and attention. No assurance can be given that, if challenged, our licensed patent or any other patents we may obtain will be found to be valid or enforceable, or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business.\nAlthough our dual fuel technology and our flare capture and recovery processing technology are licensed from two different related parties, if we should default on the payment of royalties or other material terms of either license, the license can be terminated. Such termination would have a material adverse effect on our business and on our results of operations.\nMany of our distribution agreements require us to indemnify the distributor for third-party intellectual property infringement claims and may require that we pay the damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims and the licensor was unable to adequately indemnify us. If litigation is successfully brought by a third party against us and/or our licensor in respect to intellectual property, we may be required to cease distributing or marketing certain products or obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property at material cost, redesign affected products in such a way as to avoid infringing intellectual property rights, either of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If those intellectual property rights are held by a competitor, we or the licensor may be unable to obtain the intellectual property at any price, which could also adversely affect our competitive position.\nThere is uncertainty relating to our ability to enforce our rights under international distribution agreements.\nSeveral of our exclusive distribution agreements are with foreign entities and are governed by the laws of foreign jurisdictions. If a distributor breaches such agreement, then we may incur the additional costs of determining our rights and obligations under the agreement and under applicable foreign laws, and enforcing the agreement in a foreign jurisdiction. In addition, some of the exclusive distribution agreements contain arbitration provisions that govern disputes and there is uncertainty with respect to the enforceability of these arbitration provisions under the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions. If a dispute were to arise under an exclusive distribution agreement and the related arbitration provision was not effective, then we would be exposed to the additional costs of resolving the dispute through traditional legal avenues rather than through an arbitration process.\nThe creditworthiness of our distributors may be an ongoing concern.\nWe may not always be able to collect all funds owed to us by our distributors. Some distributors may experience financial difficulties that may adversely impact our collection of accounts receivable. We regularly review the collectability and creditworthiness of our distributors to determine an appropriate allowance for credit to such distributors. If our uncollectible accounts exceed our expectations, this would adversely impact our operating results. We attempt to minimize this concern with international customers by selling most of our products by way of advanced deposits and letters of credit or similar payment methods.\nWe depend on the manufacture and installation capabilities of third parties.\nAn important element of our strategy for the marketing and release of our dual products is to enter into arrangements with multiple distribution and installation entities. The success and commercialization of our dual fuel products will be dependent, in part, upon our ability to enter into additional similar arrangements and upon the ability of these third parties to perform their responsibilities. Although we believe that parties to any such arrangements would have an economic motivation to succeed in performing their contractual responsibilities, the amount and timing of resources to be devoted to these activities may not be within our control. There can be no assurance that any such arrangements will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, that the parties to any such agreements will perform their obligations as expected, or that any revenue will be derived from such arrangements. If we are not able to enter into such arrangements, we could encounter delays in introducing our products into the market. We currently install and operate all our flare capture and recovery systems.\nWe assemble our dual fuel installation kits in-house after receiving components from outside vendors. The assembled kits are then installed by independent certified installers. Therefore, we may be dependent on contract manufacturers for the production of certain critical components for dual fuel products as well as their installation. Our flare capture and recovery processing equipment is purchased from and configured by third parties. In the event that we are unable to obtain or retain the necessary components and services on acceptable terms, we may not be able to continue to commercialize and market our products as planned. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate supplies of our products in a timely fashion at acceptable quality and prices, enter into arrangements for the manufacturing of our products with manufacturers whose facilities and procedures comply with our requirements. There can be no assurance that such manufacturers will be able to adequately supply us with our product needs. Our dependence upon others for the manufacturing of certain critical components may adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver products on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe are subject to federal, regional, state, local and foreign regulations that may impair our ability to sell our products in different jurisdictions, and more stringent regulations in the future may impair our ability to market our products.\nOur dual fuel conversion business and operations are affected by various federal, regional, state, local and foreign laws, rules, regulations and authorities. The primary domestic governing body is the EPA, which is responsible for monitoring and enforcing emissions standards and safety requirements. All domestic dual fuel conversion systems are subject to the requirements of the EPA, the primary environmental requirement of which is that the addition of our dual fuel conversion system to an existing diesel engine does not negatively impact the current emission profile of the engine or the engine\u2019s original emission profile.\nAll vehicles and components on vehicles that operate on public highways must comply with the Federal Clean Air Act and meet specific EPA or CARB emission and safety guidelines or face anti-tampering infractions. Because our vehicular dual fuel system has not been previously EPA or CARB certified as a new system, due to our primary focus being aftermarket diesel engines, we must demonstrate to the EPA or CARB that our technology has sound engineering design and does not degrade the emissions level of the model year that would be requested for commercialization.\nOur flare capture and recovery business and operations are primarily governed by the various state and local rules, regulations and authorities.\nIn addition to our operations in the United States, we currently have dealers in Australia, Canada and Latin America. We intend to market our products and technologies in other international markets, including both industrialized and developing countries. Prior to marketing our dual fuel solution in countries outside the United States, we must ensure our technology is compliant with the appropriate in-country rules and regulations and there is no assurance our technology will comply with such rules and regulations.\nAny new or revised government regulation that affects our dual fuel conversion business, whether at the foreign, federal, state, or local level, may increase our costs and the price of our products. As a result, these regulations could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends on the retention of our senior management and other key personnel.\nOur success depends largely on the skills, experience and performance of our senior management. Our senior management consists of two officers, our President/Chief Executive Officer, who has held that position for ten years, and our Chief Financial Officer, who has held that position for eighteen years. The loss of either member of our senior management could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, in the event that either our President or Chief Financial Officer is terminated by us without cause, the officer will be entitled to receive severance payments equal to nine and six months respectively (subsequently changed to three months for both individuals), of salary and certain benefits.\nIn addition, to increase revenues, we may be required to hire additional sales and marketing people and to develop a larger and more effective sales force. There can be no assurance that we will be able to hire, motivate and retain skilled marketing and sales personnel.\nSeasonal factors may affect our quarterly operating results.\nSeasonality may cause our total revenues to fluctuate as prices for our NGL products will tend to be higher in the colder winter months due to their use in heating applications and lower in the summer months for the same reason.\nInflation and changing prices may hurt our business.\nWe are generally exposed to the effects of inflation and changing prices. Due to increased oil reserves and a decrease in the growth rate of demand throughout certain parts of the world, the price of oil in the U.S. has dropped to the $35 - $50 per barrel range from almost $100 per barrel two years ago, which has resulted in a decrease in diesel prices. Given that our dual fuel conversion technology replaces a certain percentage of diesel fuel with natural gas, we have been negatively impacted by the reduction in global oil prices and the resulting changes in the net fuel savings between the two fuels.\nIf we acquire other companies or businesses we will be subject to risks that could hurt our business.\nA part of our business strategy may be based on future acquisitions or significant investments in businesses that offer complementary products and services. Promising acquisitions are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons. Any acquisitions we may complete may be made at a premium over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired companies and competition may cause us to pay more for an acquired business than its long-term fair market value. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete future acquisitions on terms favorable to us or at all. In addition, we may not be able to integrate any future acquired businesses at all or without significant distraction of management into our ongoing business. In order to finance acquisitions, it may be necessary for us to issue shares of our capital stock to the sellers of the acquired businesses and/or to seek additional funds through public or private financings. Any equity or debt financing, if available at all, may be on terms which are not favorable to us and, in the case of an equity financing or the use of our stock to pay for an acquisition, may result in dilution to our existing stockholders.\nAs we grow, we are subject to growth related risks.\nWe are subject to growth-related risks, including capacity constraints and pressure on our internal systems and personnel. In order to manage current operations and any future growth effectively, we will need to continue to implement and improve our operational, financial and management information systems and to hire, train, motivate, manage and retain employees. We may be unable to manage such growth effectively. Our management, personnel or systems may be inadequate to support our operations, and we may be unable to achieve the increased levels of revenue commensurate with the increased levels of operating expenses associated with this growth. Any such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business, operations and prospects. In addition, the cost of opening new facilities and the hiring of new personnel for those facilities could significantly decrease our profitability, if the new facilities do not generate sufficient additional revenue.\nWe incur substantial costs to operate as a public reporting company.\nWe incur substantial legal, financial, accounting and other costs and expenses to operate as a public reporting company. We believe that these costs are a disproportionately larger percentage of our revenues than they are for many larger companies, and they contribute significantly to our operating losses. In addition, the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission impose significant requirements on public companies, including ongoing disclosure obligations and mandatory corporate governance practices. Our limited senior management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to ensure ongoing compliance with these requirements. Our Common Stock is currently quoted on the OTC Markets Group\u2019s OTCQB tier. OTC Markets Group imposes no specific quotation requirements for its OTCQB tier other than that issuers must be current in their reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission. If we are successful in listing our stock for trading on a national securities exchange or having our stock quoted on the Nasdaq Stock Market, we will be subject to additional disclosure and governance obligations. There can be no assurance that we will continue to meet all of the public company requirements to which we are subject on a timely basis, or at all, or that our compliance costs will not continue to be material.\nWe are required to pay substantial cash dividends on our 10% Convertible Preferred Stock\nDuring the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we paid cash dividends on our Convertible Preferred Stock of $0 and $475,355, respectively. Our Board of Directors has determined that our cash resources are not currently sufficient to permit the payment of cash dividends in respect of the 10% Convertible Preferred Stock. The Board of Directors has therefore determined to suspend the payment of cash dividends, commencing with the dividend payable on September 30, 2015, until such time as the Board of Directors determines that the Company possesses funds legally available for the payment of dividends. We will continue to offer the option for holders to take shares of our Common Stock in lieu of cash. Although these dividends do not directly affect our net income, the requirement to pay them in cash significantly reduces the amount of cash we have available to fund operations and invest in our business.\nRisks Related to the Securities Market and our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for our shareholders.\nOur Common Stock is thinly traded and an active public market for our stock may not develop. Consequently, the market price of our Common Stock may be highly volatile. Additionally, the market price of our Common Stock could fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u25cf we are traded on the OTC Market\u2019s Group\u2019s OTCQB tier;\n\u25cf changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u25cf announcements by us or by our competitors of new or enhanced products, technologies or services or significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf regulatory developments;\n\u25cf additions or departures of senior management and other key personnel;\n\u25cf deviations in our results of operations from the estimates of securities analysts; and\n\u25cf future issuances of our Common Stock or other securities.\nWe have options, warrants and convertible preferred stock currently outstanding. Their exercise and/or conversion will cause dilution to existing and new shareholders. We expect to significantly increase the number of options we may grant in the future.\nAs of September 30, 2016, we had options and warrants outstanding to purchase 187,991,989 additional shares of Common Stock. These reserved shares include the following: 1,540,000 shares for issuance upon exercise of awards granted under our 2005 Stock Option Plan, 10,330,000 shares for issuance upon exercise of awards granted under our 2016 Stock Option Plan, and 112,846,787 shares for issuance upon exercise of stock purchase warrants. In addition, at that date we had convertible preferred stock which is convertible into 63,275,202 shares of our Common Stock.\nThe non-binding term sheet described above in Recent Developments, contemplates that we will amend the 2016 Stock Option Plan, to provide for the issuance of options to purchase up to 90,000,000 shares of Common Stock, subject to shareholder approval of an increase in the number of authorized shares of our Common Stock from 350,000,000 to 600,000,000.\nThe exercise of options and warrants outstanding today, or which may be issued in the future, and the conversion of the various series of convertible preferred stock will cause additional shares of Common Stock to be issued, resulting in dilution to investors and our existing stockholders. As of September 30, 2016, approximately 50 million shares of our Common Stock were eligible for sale in the public market exclusive of the options, warrants and convertible preferred stock described above.\nOur directors, executive officers and principal stockholders own a significant percentage of our shares, which will limit the ability of other shareholders to influence corporate matters.\nOur directors, executive officers and other principal stockholders owned or had beneficial ownership of approximately 76 percent of our outstanding Common Stock on an as-converted basis as of September 30, 2016. The ownership and beneficial ownership of these directors, executive officers and other principal stockholders would increase substantially if we complete the financing contemplated by the term sheet described above. Accordingly, these stockholders could have a significant influence over the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and also could prevent or cause a change in control. The interests of these stockholders may differ from the interests of our other stockholders. Third parties may be discouraged from making a tender offer or bid to acquire us because of this concentration of ownership.\nWe have never paid dividends on our Common Stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have paid no cash dividends on our Common Stock to date and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our Common Stock will be the shareholders\u2019 sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. The terms of our convertible preferred stock restrict our ability to pay dividends on our Common Stock if the dividends due on the convertible preferred stock are unpaid.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could prevent, deter or delay a change in control of our company.\nCertain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws could have the effect, either alone or in combination with each other, of preventing, deterring or delaying a change in control of our company, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders. Delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us.", "PERMNO": 82494, "SIC": 5900, "TIC": "APGI"}
