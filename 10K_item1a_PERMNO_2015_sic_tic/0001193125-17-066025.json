RISK FACTORS\nPopular, like other financial institutions, faces a number of risks inherent to our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and capital position. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.\nThe risks described in this report are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known by us or that we currently deem to be immaterial, or that are generally applicable to all financial institutions, also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or capital position.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUR INDUSTRY\nA significant portion of our business is concentrated in Puerto Rico, where a prolonged economic recession and a current fiscal crisis has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact us.\nA significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in Puerto Rico, which is experiencing a severe economic and fiscal crisis resulting from continuing economic contraction, persistent and significant budget deficits, a high debt burden, unfunded legacy pension obligations and lack of access to the capital markets, among other factors.\nPuerto Rico entered recession in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006 and its gross national product (GNP) thereafter contracted in real terms every year between fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2015 (inclusive), except for growth of 0.5% in fiscal year 2012 (likely as a result of the large amount of governmental stimulus and deficit spending in that fiscal year). GNP is projected to further contract for fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The Commonwealth\u2019s structural imbalance between revenue and expenditures and unfunded legacy pension obligations, coupled with the deterioration of the liquidity situation at the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico and the Commonwealth\u2019s inability to access the capital markets, have recently resulted in the government becoming unable to pay scheduled debt payments while continuing to provide government services.\nIn order to confront its liquidity constraints and budget shortfalls, the Government has been forced to implement certain extraordinary measures, which include delaying the payment of third-party payables and income tax refunds. In addition, pursuant to a local moratorium law, the Commonwealth has suspended the payment of debt service on its debts and that of several of its public corporations, and has retained certain revenues assigned to particular public corporations, redirecting the same for the funding of operational expenses. The Government has stated that certain of these emergency liquidity measures are unsustainable and have significant negative economic effects. Also, the Commonwealth has indicated that absent additional liquidity or other emergency measures, it may experience significant bank cash shortfalls as soon as May 1, 2017, triggered by the expiration of the local law moratorium and the stay of litigation imposed pursuant to PROMESA (discussed below).\nIn response to this crisis, in June 2016, the U.S. Federal Government enacted the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (\u201cPROMESA\u201d), which, among other things, established a seven-member Federally-appointed oversight board (the \u201cOversight Board\u201d) with broad powers over the finances of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities and, in order to provide relief from creditor lawsuits, enacts a temporary stay on litigation to enforce rights or remedies related to outstanding liabilities of the Commonwealth, its instrumentalities and municipalities. PROMESA also provides to the Commonwealth, its public corporations and municipalities, broad-based restructuring authority, including through a bankruptcy-type process similar to that of Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nPROMESA requires the Commonwealth to submit a fiscal plan to the Oversight Board that, among other things, ensures the funding of essential services, eliminates structural deficits and provides for a debt burden that is sustainable while respecting the relative lawful priorities or lawful liens under local law. The Commonwealth submitted a fiscal plan for consideration of the Oversight Board in October 2016 that projected that, under current policies, consolidated expenditures (including required pension payments and debt service on tax-supported debt) would, in the aggregate, exceed consolidated resources by approximately $58.7 billion from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2026 (later revised based on feedback from the Oversight Board to approximately $67.5 billion over the ten-year projection period). The plan estimated that, even assuming the Commonwealth took the measures identified in the plan, in the absence of federal Affordable Care Act funding for the Government\u2019s health programs, there would still be a material cumulative financing gap during the ten-year period before the payment of any debt service. The Oversight Board rejected the prior Administration\u2019s plan in November 2016 and granted the new Administration of Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 Nevares an extension to deliver a new fiscal plan until February 28, 2017. The Oversight Board, however, has identified a series of initiatives for inclusion in the certified fiscal plan that include the elimination of budgetary subsidies to municipalities and significant reductions in payroll expenditures and pension and/or pension-related benefits. On February 28, 2017, the Rosell\u00f3 administration submitted to their Oversight Board its draft fiscal plan which, among other initiatives, calls for significant reductions in operational expenses and subsides for municipalities and the University of Puerto Rico. The plan, which relies on significant change in economic assumptions vis a vis the baseline, projects a surplus before debt service of $11.6 billion in the aggregate during the ten year projection period (against $35.1 billion in contractual debt service).\nThe credit quality of BPPR\u2019s loan portfolio necessarily reflects, among other things, the general economic conditions in Puerto Rico and other adverse conditions affecting Puerto Rico consumers and businesses. The effects of the prolonged recession are reflected in limited loan demand, an increase in the rate of foreclosures and delinquencies on loans granted in Puerto Rico. The measures taken to address the fiscal crisis and those that may have to be taken in the near future, including higher taxes and lower governmental expenditures, will likely affect many of our individual customers and customers\u2019 businesses, which could cause credit losses that adversely affect us. The size of the financing gap indicated by the Commonwealth\u2019s fiscal projections suggest that the level of fiscal adjustment of any fiscal plan approved by the Oversight Board, and its resulting impact on the local economy, will be significant, particularly considering the Oversight Board\u2019s stated target of the government\u2019s fiscal year 2019 to achieve budgetary balance. Such fiscal adjustment may also result in significant resistance from local politicians and other stakeholders, which may lead to social and political instability. The aforementioned conditions may negatively affect consumer confidence, which would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these conditions and cause decreased borrowings, either due to reduced demand or reductions in the borrowing base available for customer loans. Any reduction in consumer spending because of these issues may also adversely impact our interest and non-interest revenues.\nIf global or local economic conditions worsen or the Government of Puerto Rico is unable to manage its fiscal crisis, including consummating an orderly restructuring of its debt obligations while continuing to provide essential services, those adverse effects could continue or worsen in ways that we are not able to predict and that are outside of our control. While PROMESA provides the Commonwealth with tools to restructure the debt obligations of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities in an orderly manner, these tools are new and untested. Furthermore, the size of the fiscal gaps suggested by the Commonwealth\u2019s projections indicates the possibility of significant creditor losses. Both of these factors may make any debt restructuring process highly adversarial and protracted. Under such circumstances, we could experience an increase in the level of provision for loan losses, nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and reserve for credit losses. Furthermore, the continued contraction of Puerto Rico\u2019s economy may negatively affect our ability to generate loans in Puerto Rico with an adequate credit risk profile and at a commensurate pricing. These factors could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition.\nThe Corporation\u2019s assets and revenue composition by geographical area and by business segment reporting are presented in Note 42 to the consolidated financial statements. For additional information regarding the Puerto Rico economy and the current fiscal crisis, refer to \u201cGeographic and government risk\u201d in the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of the Annual Report.\nFurther deterioration in collateral values of properties securing our construction, commercial and mortgage loan portfolios would result in increased credit losses and continue to harm our results of operations.\nFurther deterioration of the value of real estate collateral securing our construction, commercial and mortgage loan portfolios would result in increased credit losses. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 3%, 32% and 29% of our non-covered loan portfolio consisted of construction loans, commercial loans secured by real estate and mortgage loans, respectively.\nSubstantially our entire loan portfolio is located within the boundaries of the U.S. economy. Whether the collateral is in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the British Virgin Islands or the U.S. mainland, the performance of our loan portfolio and the collateral value backing the transactions are dependent upon the performance of and conditions within each specific real estate market. Recent economic reports related to the real estate market in Puerto Rico indicate that several sectors of the real estate market are subject to reductions in value related to general economic conditions. In particular, the value of real estate collateral located in Puerto Rico may be further affected by actions taken by the Commonwealth or the PROMESA Oversight Board to address Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal and economic crisis. Not only are such actions likely to have negative economic effects in the short run, but also certain measures recommended by the Oversight Board for inclusion in the fiscal plan, and incorporated into the Rosell\u00f3 Administration fiscal plan proposed, such as reforming the local property tax regime, could have a direct impact on the value of local real estate.\nWe measure loan impairment based on the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent, which is derived from estimated collateral values, principally obtained from appraisal reports that take into consideration prices in observed transactions involving similar assets in similar locations, size and supply and demand. An appraisal report is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made. If the appraisal does not reflect the amount that may be obtained upon any sale or foreclosure of the property, we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the property. In addition, given the current slowdown in the real estate market in Puerto Rico, the properties securing these loans may be difficult to dispose of, if foreclosed.\nCommercial and construction loans, mostly secured by commercial and residential development real estate properties, entail a higher credit risk than consumer and residential mortgage loans, since they are larger in size, may have less collateral coverage, concentrate more risk in a single borrower and are generally more sensitive to economic downturns. As of December 31, 2016, non-covered commercial and construction loans secured by commercial and residential development real estate properties, amounted to $ 8.0 billion or 35% of the total non-covered loan portfolio.\nBPPR has various subsidiaries holding specific assets acquired in satisfaction of loans for real estate development projects. Total non-covered assets of those subsidiaries amounted to $34.7 million as of December 31, 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, net charge-offs for loans individually evaluated for impairment based on the values of properties securing our non-covered construction, commercial and mortgage loan portfolios totaled $0.1 million, $24.8 million and $13.1 million, respectively. Continued deterioration of the fair value of real estate properties for collateral dependent impaired loans would require increases in our provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses. Any such increase would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations. For more information on the credit quality of our construction, commercial and mortgage portfolio, see the Credit Risk section of the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Annual Report.\nDifficult market conditions have adversely affected the financial industry and our results of operations and financial condition.\nDuring the financial crisis that commenced in 2008, market instability and lack of investor confidence led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce or cease providing funding to borrowers, including other financial institutions. This led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence, increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity in general. The resulting economic pressures on consumers and uncertainty about the financial markets adversely affected our industry and our business, results of operations and financial condition. The increased regulation of our industry, including as a result of the EESA and the Dodd-Frank Act and the creation of the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has increased and may in the future further increase our compliance costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. The lingering effects of these circumstances have continued to affect our business. A re-occurrence of these difficult conditions would exacerbate the economic challenges facing us and others in the financial industry.\nLegislative and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations.\nPopular is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal, New York and Puerto Rico banking authorities. Any change in applicable federal, New York or Puerto Rico laws or regulations could have a substantial impact on our operations. Additional laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect Popular\u2019s powers, authority and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on Popular\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Further, regulators in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties, have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe and unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies. The exercise of this regulatory discretion and power could have a negative impact on Popular.\nIn 2008, responding to what has been commonly referred to as the financial crisis, government regulatory agencies and political bodies began placing increased focus and scrutiny on the financial services industry. The U.S. Government intervened on an unprecedented scale. Several funding and capital programs by the Federal Reserve Board and the U.S. Treasury were launched in 2008 and 2009, with the objective of enhancing the ability of financial institutions to raise liquidity. These programs had the effect of increasing the degree or nature of regulatory supervision to which we are subjected. These and other potential regulation and scrutiny may, or proposed legislative and regulatory changes could, significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations or earnings.\nFurthermore, the Commonwealth has enacted various reforms in response to its fiscal problems and is likely to implement additional reforms as part of its fiscal plan under PROMESA. In 2014, the Government of Puerto Rico approved an amendment to the Internal Revenue Code, which, among other things, changed the income tax rate for capital gains from 15% to 20%. As a result, Popular recognized additional income tax expense of approximately $20.0 million during 2014. In addition, in May 2015, the Government approved an increase in the sales and use tax rate, effective July 1, 2015, from 7% to 11.5% and expanded the sales and use tax to certain business-to-business services that were previously exempt. The Rossell\u00f3 Administration has further announced its intention to enact comprehensive tax reform during 2017. The PROMESA Oversight Board has also recommended a reform of the island\u2019s property tax system. Legislative changes, particularly changes in tax laws, could adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act imposes new capital requirements, assessments and restrictions on our businesses, impacting the profitability of our business activities and changing certain of our business practices, and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs.\nOn July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law, which significantly changes the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike, including several provisions that will affect how community banks, thrifts, and small bank and thrift holding companies will be regulated in the future.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, imposes new capital requirements on bank holding companies; changes the base for FDIC insurance assessments to a bank\u2019s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, rather than upon its deposit base, permanently raises the standard deposit insurance limit to $250,000; and expands the FDIC\u2019s authority to raise insurance premiums. The legislation also calls for the FDIC to raise the ratio of reserves to deposits from 1.15% to 1.35% for deposit insurance purposes by September 30, 2020 and to \u201coffset the effect\u201d of increased assessments on insured depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. The Dodd-Frank Act also limits interchange fees payable on debit card transactions, establishes the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as an independent entity within the Federal Reserve, which has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards, and contains provisions on mortgage-related matters such as steering incentives, determinations as to a borrower\u2019s ability to repay and prepayment penalties. The Dodd-Frank Act also includes provisions that affect corporate governance and executive compensation at all publicly-traded companies and allows financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts. The legislation also restricts proprietary trading, places restrictions on the owning or sponsoring of hedge funds and private equity funds, and regulates the derivatives activities of banks and their affiliates.\nThese provisions, or any other aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry, if enacted or adopted, may impact the profitability of our business activities or change certain of our business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans, and achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. These changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations in order to comply, and could therefore also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. While the change in administration in the U.S. may ultimately roll back or modify certain of the regulations adopted or proposed by federal and state regulatory agencies, uncertainty about the timing and scope of any such changes, as well as the cost of complying with a new regulatory regime, may negatively impact our businesses, at least in the short term, even if the long-term impact of any such changes are positive for our businesses.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe are subject to default risk in our loan portfolio.\nWe are subject to the risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures with respect to the loans originated or acquired. We establish provisions for loan losses, which lead to reductions in the income from operations, in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level which is deemed appropriate by management based upon an assessment of the quality of the loan portfolio in accordance with established procedures and guidelines. This process, which is critical to our financial results and condition, requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic and market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay the loans. There can be no assurance that management has accurately estimated the level of future loan losses or that Popular will not have to increase the provision for loan losses in the future as a result of future increases in non-performing loans or for other reasons beyond our control. Any such increases in our provisions for loan losses or any loan losses in excess of our provisions for loan losses would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and result of operations. We will continue to evaluate our provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses and may be required to increase such amounts.\nActions taken by the Commonwealth government or the PROMESA Oversight Board to address the ongoing fiscal and economic crisis in Puerto Rico could materially affect the value of our portfolio of Puerto Rico government securities and our loans to governmental entities, including municipalities.\nWe have direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government, its public corporations and municipalities that amounted to approximately $ 584 million, of which approximately $ 529 million is outstanding, at December 31, 2016. Deterioration of the Commonwealth\u2019s fiscal and economic situation, including any negative ratings implications, could further adversely affect the value of our Puerto Rico government obligations, resulting in losses to us.\nOf the amount outstanding at December 31, 2015, $ 459 million consists of loans and $ 70 million consisted of securities, $17 million represents obligations from the Commonwealth or its public corporations, each of which has been designated as a covered entity under PROMESA. Obligations from various municipalities in Puerto Rico constitute, however, the bulk of our direct exposure to Puerto Rico government obligations. These obligations, which amounted to approximately $512 million at December 31, 2016, are in most cases \u201cgeneral obligations,\u201d to which the applicable municipality has pledged its good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power, or \u201cspecial obligations,\u201d to which the applicable municipality has pledged other revenues. The automatic stay on litigation imposed by PROMESA applies to all municipal obligations to which we are a party (other than to municipal obligations issued after the enactment of PROMESA). Furthermore, although the PROMESA Oversight Board has not designated any of the Commonwealth\u2019s 78 municipalities as covered entities under PROMESA, it may decide to do so in the future.\nWhile the fiscal plan submitted by the Commonwealth to the Oversight Board on February 28, 2017 did not contemplate a restructuring of the debt of Puerto Rico\u2019s municipalities, the plan did call for the gradual elimination of budgetary subsidies provided to municipalities, which constitute a material portion of the operating revenues of certain municipalities. The Oversight Board had previously expressly called for the elimination of these budgetary subsidies as part of any certified fiscal plan. Furthermore, municipalities are also likely to be affected by the negative economic and other effects resulting from expense, revenue or cash management measures taken to address the Commonwealth\u2019s fiscal and liquidity shortfalls.\nWe also have indirect exposure to loans or securities that are payable by non-governmental entities, but which carry the guarantee of a Puerto Rico governmental entity to cover any shortfall in collateral in the event of borrower default, which amounted to approximately $406 million at December 31, 2016. These included approximately $326 million in residential mortgage loans guaranteed by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority (\u201cHFA\u201d), an entity that has been designated as a covered entity under PROMESA. These mortgage loans are secured by the underlying properties and the HFA guarantee serves to cover shortfalls in collateral in the event of a borrower default. Also, Popular had approximately $49 million in Puerto Rico housing bonds pass-through backed by FNMA, GNMA or second mortgages residential loans, and approximately $31 million of commercial real estate notes issued by government entities, but payable from rent paid by third parties.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. There can be no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings.\nWe have procedures in place to mitigate the impact of a default among our counterparties. We request collateral for most credit exposures with other financial institutions and monitor these on a regular basis. Nonetheless, market volatility could impact the valuation of collateral held by us and result in losses.\nOur ability to raise financing is dependent in part on market confidence. In times when market confidence is affected by events related to well-known financial institutions, risk aversion among participants may increase substantially and make it more difficult for us to borrow in the credit or capital markets.\nWe are exposed to credit risk from mortgage loans that have been sold or are being serviced subject to recourse arrangements.\nPopular is generally at risk for mortgage loan defaults from the time it funds a loan until the time the loan is sold or securitized into a mortgage-backed security. We have furthermore retained, through recourse arrangements, part of the credit risk on sales of mortgage loans, and we also service certain mortgage loan portfolios with recourse. At December 31, 2016, we serviced $1.7 billion in residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions, principally loans associated with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac programs. In the event of any customer default, pursuant to the credit recourse provided, we are required to repurchase the loan or reimburse the third-party investor for the incurred loss. The maximum potential amount of future payments that we would be required to make under the recourse arrangements in the event of nonperformance by the borrowers is equivalent to the total outstanding balance of the residential mortgage loans serviced with recourse and interest, if applicable. During 2016, we repurchased approximately $ 44 million in mortgage loans subject to the credit recourse provisions. In the event of nonperformance by the borrower, we have rights to the underlying collateral securing the mortgage loan. As of December 31, 2016, our liability established to cover the estimated credit loss exposure related to loans sold or serviced with credit recourse amounted to $ 54 million. We may suffer losses on these loans when the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance of the loan plus any uncollected interest advanced and the costs of holding and disposing of the related property.\nDefective and repurchased loans may harm our business and financial condition.\nIn connection with the sale and securitization of loans, we are required to make a variety of customary representations and warranties regarding Popular and the loans being sold or securitized. Our obligations with respect to these representations and warranties are generally outstanding for the life of the loan, and they relate to, among other things:\n\u2022\ncompliance with laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nunderwriting standards;\n\u2022\nthe accuracy of information in the loan documents and loan file; and\n\u2022\nthe characteristics and enforceability of the loan.\nA loan that does not comply with these representations and warranties may take longer to sell, may impact our ability to obtain third party financing for the loan, and be unsalable or salable only at a significant discount. If such a loan is sold before we detect non-compliance, we may be obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly, or we may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any loss, either of which could reduce our cash available for operations and liquidity. Management believes that it has established controls to ensure that loans are originated in accordance with the secondary market\u2019s requirements, but mistakes may be made, or certain employees may deliberately violate our lending policies. We seek to minimize repurchases and losses from defective loans by correcting flaws, if possible, and selling or re-selling such loans. We have established specific reserves for probable losses related to repurchases resulting from representations and warranty violations on specific portfolios. At December 31, 2016, Popular\u2019s reserve for estimated losses from representation and warranty arrangements amounted to $12 million, which was included as part of other liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial condition. Nonetheless, we do not expect any such losses to be significant, although if they were to occur, they would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nSubstantially all the deposits of BPPR and BPNA are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC\u2019s DIF, and as a result, BPPR and BPNA are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act ushered in major changes to the FDIC deposit insurance system. In particular, in October 2010, the FDIC adopted a new Restoration Plan to ensure that the DIF reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 2020. In addition, in March 2016, the FDIC adopted a final rule which imposes a surcharge on the deposit insurance assessments of depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets, including BPPR, beginning in the third quarter of 2016 and continuing through the earlier of the quarter that the DIF reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 1.35% and December 31, 2018. See the \u201cSupervision and Regulation-FDIC Insurance\u201d discussion within Item 1. Business of the Annual Report for additional information related to the FDIC\u2019s deposit insurance assessments applicable to BPPR and BPNA.\nFor 2016, the FDIC deposit insurance expense of Popular totaled $ 25 million. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures, our level of non-performing assets increase, or our risk profile changes or our capital position is impaired, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recently increased levels. Any future increases or special assessments may materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, it may adversely affect our financial condition and future results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $ 627 million and $39 million of goodwill and amortizable intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet related to our Puerto Rico and United States operations. If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. Under GAAP, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in Popular\u2019s stock price related to macroeconomic conditions in the global market as well as the weakness in the Puerto Rico economy and fiscal situation, reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in the industry.\nThe goodwill impairment evaluation process requires us to make estimates and assumptions with regards to the fair value of our reporting units. Actual values may differ significantly from these estimates. Such differences could result in future impairment of goodwill that would, in turn, negatively impact our results of operations and the reporting unit where the goodwill is recorded. Critical assumptions that are used as part of these evaluations include:\n\u2022\na selection of comparable publicly traded companies, based on nature of business, location and size;\n\u2022\na selection of comparable acquisition and capital raising transactions;\n\u2022\nthe discount rate applied to future earnings, based on an estimate of the cost of equity;\n\u2022\nthe potential future earnings of the reporting unit; and\n\u2022\nthe market growth and new business assumptions.\nWe conducted our annual evaluation of goodwill during the third quarter of 2016 using July 31, 2016 as the annual evaluation date. This evaluation is a two- step process.\nPopular Securities failed Step 1 of the annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of July 31, 2016, requiring the completion of Step 2. The results of the Step 2 indicated that the implied fair value of goodwill was below the carrying value resulting in an impairment charge of all goodwill in that reporting unit of $3.8 million at July 31, 2016.\nFor the BPPR reporting unit, the average estimated fair value calculated in Step 1 using all valuation methodologies exceeded BPPR\u2019s equity value by approximately $549 million in the July 31, 2016 annual test.\nBPNA failed Step 1 in the annual goodwill impairment test as of July 31, 2016, since its carrying amount exceeded its fair value by $84 million or 5% requiring the completion of Step 2. The results of Step 2 indicated that the implied fair value of goodwill exceeded the goodwill carrying value at July 31, 2016 by $166 million, resulting in no goodwill impairment. If the fair value of BPNA, which is principally impacted by its expected level of profitability, declines further in the future without a corresponding decrease in the fair value of its net assets, or if loan discounts improve without a corresponding increase in fair value of the BPNA reporting unit, Popular may be required to record a goodwill impairment charge with respect to the BPNA reporting unit.\nFurthermore, as part of the analyses, management performed a reconciliation of the aggregate fair values determined for the reporting units to the market capitalization of Popular, Inc., concluding that the fair value results determined for the reporting units in the July 31, 2016 annual assessment were reasonable. Declines in Popular\u2019s market capitalization could increase the risk of goodwill impairment in the future. The FASB issued ASU 2017-04 in January 2017, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the two-step goodwill impairment test under the current guidance. Goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit\u2019s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.\nIf we are required to record a charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements because an impairment of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by applicable regulators.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain key senior leaders, and competition for such senior leaders can be intense in most areas of our business. Our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. We also may be subject to limitations on compensation practices by the FDIC or other regulators, which may or may not affect our competitors.\nThe Federal Reserve Board reviews, as part of its regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation agreements of banking organizations that are not \u201clarge, complex banking organizations\u201d. These reviews are tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization\u2019s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of this supervisory initiative are included in reports of examination. Deficiencies are incorporated into the organization\u2019s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization\u2019s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization\u2019s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. In May 2016, the Federal Reserve Board, other federal banking agencies and the SEC jointly published re-proposed rules (originally proposed in April 2011) designed to implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibiting incentive compensation arrangements that would encourage inappropriate risk taking at covered financial institutions, which includes a bank or bank holding company with $1 billion or more of assets, such as Popular, PNA, BPPR and BPNA. Although the re-proposed rules include more stringent requirements, it cannot be determined at this time whether or when a final rule will be adopted. Compliance with such a final rule may substantially affect the manner in which we structure compensation for our executives and other employees. For a more detailed discussion of these proposed rules, see the \u201cSupervision and Regulation-Incentive Compensation\u201d section within Item 1. Business of the Annual Report.\nThe scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators\u2019 policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the near future. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the ability of Popular and our subsidiaries to hire, retain and motivate key employees. Limitations on our compensation practices could have a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain talented senior leaders in support of our long-term strategy.\nAs a holding company, we depend on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries for liquidity.\nWe are a bank holding company and depend primarily on dividends from our banking and other operating subsidiaries to fund our cash needs. These obligations and needs include capitalizing subsidiaries, repaying maturing debt and paying debt service on outstanding debt. Our banking subsidiaries, BPPR and BPNA, are limited by law in their ability to make dividend payments and other distributions to us based on their earnings and capital position. In addition, based on its current financial condition, BPNA may not declare or pay a dividend without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board and the NYSDFS. A failure by our banking subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow to make dividend payments to us may have a negative impact on our results of operation and financial position. Also, a failure by the bank holding company to access sufficient liquidity resources to meet all projected cash needs in the ordinary course of business may have a detrimental impact on our financial condition and ability to compete in the market.\nWe are subject to risk related to our own credit rating; actions by the rating agencies or having capital levels below well-capitalized could raise the cost of our obligations, which could affect our ability to borrow or to enter into hedging agreements in the future and may have other adverse effects on our business.\nActions by the rating agencies could raise the cost of our borrowings since lower rated securities are usually required by the market to pay higher rates than obligations of higher credit quality.\nOur credit ratings were reduced substantially in 2009, and our senior unsecured ratings are now \u201cnon-investment grade\u201d with the three major rating agencies. The market for non-investment grade securities is much smaller and less liquid than for investment grade securities. Therefore, if we were to attempt to issue preferred stock or debt securities into the capital markets, it is possible that there would not be sufficient demand to complete a transaction and the cost could be substantially higher than for more highly rated securities.\nThe Corporation\u2019s banking subsidiaries currently do not use borrowings that are rated by the major rating agencies, as these banking subsidiaries are funded primarily with deposits and secured borrowings. At December 31, 2016, the banking subsidiaries had $14 million in deposits that were subject to rating triggers.\nIn addition, changes in our ratings and capital levels below well-capitalized could affect our relationships with some creditors and business counterparties. For example, a portion of our hedging transactions include ratings triggers or well-capitalized language that permit counterparties to either request additional collateral or terminate our agreements with them based on our below investment grade ratings. The fair value of derivative instruments in a liability position subject to financial covenants approximated $0.8 million at December 31, 2016, with Popular providing collateral totaling $4 million to cover the net liability position with counterparties on these derivative instruments. Although we have been able to meet any additional collateral requirements thus far and expect that we would be able to enter into agreements with substitute counterparties if any of our existing agreements were terminated, changes in our ratings or capital levels below well capitalized could create additional costs for our businesses.\nIn addition, servicing, licensing and custodial agreements that we are party to with third parties include ratings covenants. Servicing rights represent a contractual right and not a beneficial ownership interest in the underlying mortgage loans. Upon failure to maintain the required credit ratings, the third parties could have the right to require Popular to engage a substitute fund custodian and/or increase collateral levels securing the recourse obligations. Popular services residential mortgage loans subject to credit recourse provisions. Certain contractual agreements require us to post collateral to secure such recourse obligations if our required credit ratings are not maintained. Collateral pledged by us to secure recourse obligations approximated $62 million at December 31, 2016. We could be required to post additional collateral under the agreements. Management expects that we would be able to meet additional collateral requirements if and when needed. The requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of custodian funds could reduce Popular\u2019s liquidity resources and impact its operating results. The termination of those agreements or the inability to realize servicing income for our businesses could have an adverse effect on those businesses. Other counterparties are also sensitive to the risk of a ratings downgrade and the implications for our businesses and may be less likely to engage in transactions with us, or may only engage in them at a substantially higher cost, if our ratings remain below investment grade.\nWe are subject to regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and if we fail to meet these guidelines our business and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nUnder regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and other regulatory requirements, Popular and our banking subsidiaries must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off balance sheet items, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators regarding components, risk weightings and other factors. If we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our business and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. If we fail to maintain well-capitalized status under the regulatory framework, or are deemed not well managed under regulatory exam procedures, or if we experience certain regulatory violations, our status as a financial holding company and our related eligibility for a streamlined review process for acquisition proposals, and our ability to offer certain financial products will be compromised and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs discussed above, under the Dodd-Frank Act, all financial companies with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, such as Popular, that are supervised by a primary federal financial regulatory agency, are required to perform an annual stress test. This stress test supports the regulator\u2019s analysis of the adequacy of a banking organization\u2019s capital and is required as part of Popular\u2019s capital management and review. The stress test is performed utilizing a variety of hypothetical stressed economic scenarios dictated by the Federal Reserve Board. If we are deemed to have inadequate capital under the hypothetical scenarios, then our regulator could prohibit us from taking certain capital actions, such as paying dividends or repurchasing common stock, or require us to increase our regulatory capital, including through the issuance of common stock that would dilute the ownership of existing shareholders.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules approved on July 9, 2013 by the U.S. federal banking agencies substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries. The Basel III Capital Rules revised the definitions and the components of regulatory capital, as well as modified certain asset risk weights and other matters affecting the numerator and denominator in a banking institutions\u2019 regulatory capital ratios thus implementing a new more complex methodology to calculate regulatory capital ratios. The Basel III Capital Rules became effective on January 1, 2015, subject to a phase-in period for certain provisions. The need to maintain more capital than has been historically required and calculated under revised standards could limit our business activities, including lending, and our ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. It could also depress our return on equity, thereby making it more difficult to earn our cost of capital. Moreover, although these new requirements are being phased-in over time, U.S. federal banking agencies have been taking into account future expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet these new requirements, including under stress conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividends and acquisitions.\nDue to the importance and complexity of the stress test process and new capital rules calculations under Basel III, we have dedicated additional resources to comply with these requirements. No assurance can be provided, however, that these resources will be deemed sufficient or that we will be deemed to have adequate capital under the hypothetical economic stress scenarios, which would affect our ability to take certain capital actions in the future.\nCertain of the provisions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation have the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the members of the Board of Directors are divided into three classes as nearly equal as possible. At each annual meeting of stockholders, one-third of the members of the Board of Directors will be elected for a three-year term, and the other directors will remain in office until their three-year terms expire. Therefore, control of the Board of Directors cannot be changed in one year, and at least two annual meetings must be held before a majority of the members of the Board of Directors can be changed. Our certificate of incorporation also provides that a director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be removed by the stockholders only for cause by a vote of at least two -thirds of the combined voting power of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote for the election of directors. These provisions have the effect of making it more difficult to change the Board of Directors, and may make the Board of Directors less responsive to stockholder control. These provisions also may tend to discourage attempts by third parties to acquire Popular because of the additional time and expense involved and a greater possibility of failure, and, as a result, may adversely affect the price that a potential purchaser would be willing to pay for the capital stock, thereby reducing the amount a stockholder might realize in, for example, a tender offer for our capital stock.\nThe resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.\nWe face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. For further information relating to our legal risk, see Note 28, \u201cCommitments & Contingencies\u201d, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe and our subsidiaries and affiliates, as well as EVERTEC, conduct business with financial institutions and/or card payment networks operating in countries whose nationals, including some of our customers\u2019 customers, engage in transactions in countries that are the targets of U.S. economic sanctions and embargoes. If we or our subsidiaries or affiliates or EVERTEC are found to have failed to comply with applicable U.S. sanctions laws and regulations in these instances, we could be exposed to fines, sanctions and other penalties or other governmental investigations.\nWe and our subsidiaries and affiliates, as well as EVERTEC, conduct business with financial institutions and/or card payment networks operating in countries whose nationals, including some of our customers\u2019 customers, engage in transactions in countries that are the target of U.S. economic sanctions and embargoes. As U.S. - based entities, we and our subsidiaries and affiliates, as well as EVERTEC, are obligated to comply with the economic sanctions regulations administered by OFAC. These regulations prohibit U.S.-based entities from entering into or facilitating unlicensed transactions with, for the benefit of, or in some cases involving the property and property interests of, persons, governments or countries designated by the U.S. government under one or more sanctions regimes and also prohibit transactions that provide a benefit\nthat is received in a country designated under one or more sanctions regimes. Failure to comply with U.S. sanctions and embargoes may result in material fines, sanctions or other penalties being imposed on us. In addition, various state and municipal governments, universities and other investors maintain prohibitions or restrictions on investments in companies that do business involving sanctioned countries or entities, and this could adversely affect the market for our securities. For these reasons, we have established risk-based policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with applicable U.S. laws and regulations. EVERTEC has also done this. These policies and procedures employ software to screen transactions for evidence of sanctioned-country and person\u2019s involvement. Consistent with a risk-based approach and the difficulties in identifying all transactions of our customers\u2019 customers that may involve a sanctioned country, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating applicable U.S. laws and regulations in transactions in which we engage, and such violations could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time we have identified and voluntarily self-disclosed to OFAC transactions that were not timely identified and blocked by our policies and procedures for screening transactions that might violate the economic sanctions regulations administered by OFAC. Although OFAC\u2019s response to our recent voluntary self-disclosures of these apparent violations has been to issue cautionary letters to us, there can be no assurances that our failures to comply with U.S. sanctions and embargoes will not result in material fines, sanctions or other penalties being imposed on us.\nWe have agreed to indemnify EVERTEC for certain claims or damages related to the economic sanctions regulations administered by OFAC. We cannot predict the timing, total costs or ultimate outcome of any OFAC review, or to what extent, if at all, we could be subject to indemnification claims, fines, sanctions or other penalties.\nRISKS RELATED TO ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS\nThe Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction increased BPPR\u2019s commercial real estate and construction loan portfolio, which have a greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans.\nThe acquisition from the FDIC on April 30, 2010 of most of the former Westernbank\u2019s loan portfolio increased the percentage of our loan portfolio represented by commercial real estate and construction loans. This type of lending is generally considered to have more complex credit risks than traditional single-family residential or consumer lending because the principal is concentrated in a limited number of loans with repayment dependent on the successful operation or completion of the related real estate or construction project. Consequently, these loans are more sensitive to the current adverse conditions in the real estate market and the general economy. These loans are generally less predictable, more difficult to evaluate and monitor, and their collateral may be more difficult to dispose of in a market decline. Furthermore, since these loans are to Puerto Rico-based borrowers, Popular\u2019s credit exposure concentration in Puerto Rico increased as a result of the acquisition. Although the negative economic aspects of these risks were substantially reduced as a result of the FDIC loss sharing agreements, changes in economic conditions have led and could continue to lead to higher loan charge-offs in connection with the FDIC-assisted transaction all of which could not be totally supported by the loss sharing agreements with the FDIC.\nAlthough the loan portfolios acquired as part of the Westernbank transaction were initially accounted for at fair value, there was no assurance at acquisition that there would not be additional charge-offs to this portfolio. The fluctuations in\neconomic conditions, including those related to local residential, commercial real estate and construction markets, have increased and may continue to increase the level of charge-offs on the loan portfolio that we have acquired and correspondingly reduce our net income. These fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlled and may have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition even if other favorable events occur.\nAlthough we entered into loss sharing agreements with the FDIC which provide that 80% of losses related to specified loan portfolios that we acquired in connection with the FDIC-assisted transaction would be borne by the FDIC, we are not protected for all losses resulting from charge-offs with respect to those specified loan portfolios. Additionally, the loss sharing agreements have limited terms, and the one applicable to commercial loans expired on June 30, 2015. Therefore, any charge-off of related losses that we experience after the term of the loss sharing agreements will not be reimbursed by the FDIC and will negatively impact our results of operations. The loss sharing agreements also impose standard requirements on us which must be satisfied in order to retain loss share protections. The FDIC has the right to refuse or delay payment for loan losses if the loss sharing agreements are not managed in accordance with their terms.\nOur decisions regarding the fair value of assets acquired could be inaccurate and our estimated loss share indemnification asset in the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction may be inaccurate, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects.\nManagement made various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of acquired loan portfolios, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of secured loans. In the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction, we recorded a loss share indemnification asset that we consider adequate to absorb future losses which may occur in the acquired loan portfolio. In determining the size of the loss share indemnification asset, we analyze the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volume and classification of loans, volume and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals, local economic conditions, and other pertinent information. If our assumptions are incorrect, our actual losses could be higher than estimated and increased loss reserves may be needed to respond to different economic conditions or adverse developments in the acquired loan portfolio. Any increase in future loan losses could have a negative effect on our operating results. To the extent that estimated losses on the Westernbank portfolio were (for the commercial loss share agreement, which expired in 2015) or are (for the single-family loss share agreement, which expires on June 30, 2020) not realized before the expiration of the loss sharing agreements, such losses would not be subject to reimbursement from the FDIC and, accordingly, would require us to make a material adjustment to the value of our loss share indemnification asset and the related true up payment obligation to the FDIC, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results for the period in which such adjustment is taken.\nRefer to Note 12 of the accompanying financial statements for additional information on the Westernbank FDIC-assisted transaction, including the accounting for the indemnification asset assets and true up payment obligation. Also, refer to Note 10 for information on the accounting for the acquired loan portfolio.\nOur ability to obtain reimbursement under the loss sharing agreements on covered assets depends on our compliance with the terms of the loss sharing agreements as well as the FDIC\u2019s interpretation thereof.\nThe loss share agreements contain specific terms and conditions regarding the management of the covered assets that BPPR must follow to receive reimbursement on losses from the FDIC. Under the loss share agreements, BPPR must:\n\u2022\nmanage and administer the covered assets and collect and effect charge-offs and recoveries with respect to such covered assets in a manner consistent with its usual and prudent business and banking practices and, with respect to single family shared-loss loans, the procedures (including collection procedures) customarily employed by BPPR in servicing and administering mortgage loans for its own account and the servicing procedures established by FNMA or FHLMC, as in effect from time to time, and in accordance with accepted mortgage servicing practices of prudent lending institutions;\n\u2022\nexercise its best judgment in managing, administering and collecting amounts on covered assets and effecting charge-offs with respect to the covered assets;\n\u2022\nuse commercially reasonable efforts to maximize recoveries with respect to losses on single family shared-loss assets and best efforts to maximize collections with respect to commercial shared-loss assets;\n\u2022\nretain sufficient staff to perform the duties under the loss share agreements;\n\u2022\nadopt and implement accounting, reporting, record-keeping and similar systems with respect to the commercial shared-loss assets;\n\u2022\ncomply with the terms of the modification guidelines approved by the FDIC or another federal agency for any single-family shared loss loan;\n\u2022\nprovide notice with respect to proposed transactions pursuant to which a third party or affiliate will manage, administer or collect any commercial shared-loss assets; and\n\u2022\nfile monthly and quarterly certificates with the FDIC specifying the amount of losses, charge-offs and recoveries.\nUnder the loss share agreements, BPPR is also required to maintain books and records sufficient to ensure and document compliance with the terms of the loss share agreements and deliver certain certificates regarding compliance with the terms of each of the loss share agreements and the computations required thereunder. The required terms of the agreements are extensive and failure to comply with any of the guidelines could result in a specific asset or group of assets permanently losing their loss sharing coverage.\nBPPR\u2019s loss share agreements with the FDIC specify that disputes can be submitted to arbitration before a review board under the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. Since 2012, BPPR and the FDIC have engaged in various disputes with respect to the Westernbank commercial loss share agreement, including with respect to the methodology for the computation of charge-offs, the restructuring and modification of certain covered real estate loans, the interpretation of the provision governing portfolio sales and BPPR\u2019s maximization of collections on shared-loss assets. Please refer to our Legal Proceedings discussion in Note 28 for a description of these historical and active disputes in connection with the Westernbank loss-share agreements with the FDIC. Certain of these disputes have been submitted to arbitration. During 2016, BPPR received adverse decisions in two separate arbitration proceedings with respect to the Westernbank commercial loss share agreement in which BPPR had sought damages in the amount of $55 million and $88.5 million, respectively. As a result of such arbitration decisions, Popular had to recognize during 2016 a pre-tax charge of approximately $171.8 million in connection with unreimbursed losses considered in the arbitration proceedings, the related adjustment to the true-up obligation owed to the FDIC at the end of the loss-share agreements in 2020 and recoveries previously incorporated in the net damages claimed in the arbitration.\nFurthermore, on November 12, 2015, the FDIC notified BPPR that it (a) would deny certain claims included in BPPR\u2019s quarterly certificate for the second quarter of 2015 and (b) withhold payment of approximately $5.5 million attributed to the $6.9 million in losses BPPR claimed thereunder. In support of its denial, the FDIC alleged that BPPR did not comply with its obligation under the commercial loss share agreement, including compliance with certain provisions of GAAP, acting in accordance with prudent banking practices, managing Shared-Loss Assets in the same manner as BPPR\u2019s non-Shared-Loss Assets, and using best efforts to maximize collections on the Shared-Loss Assets. BPPR disagrees with the FDIC\u2019s allegations, and accordingly, on January 27, 2016 delivered to the FDIC a notice of dispute under the commercial loss share agreement and on May 20, 2016 filed a demand for arbitration to resolve such dispute and award BPPR damages in the amount of $4.9 million. On February 10, 2017, BPPR withdrew one of its claims, as a result of which its damages demand was reduced to approximately $4.3 million.\nOn December 16, 2016, the FDIC initiated a proceeding before the same panel that sat on a prior arbitration proceeding between BPPR and the FDIC that resulted in a settlement among the parties dated as of October 2014. The panel\u2019s chair also sat on the December 2015 Dispute that resulted in an adverse award for BPPR. Through this proceeding, the FDIC sought to claw back a $12.6 million reimbursement paid on one of the Shared-Loss Assets at issue in the January 2016 Dispute.\nOn February 23, 2017, the FDIC and BPPR entered into a settlement in principle whereby the parties agreed to withdraw both the January 2016 and the December 2016 Disputes in exchange for a payment by BPPR to the FDIC of approximately $5.5 million. Such settlement is still subject to the delivery of definite documentation. The Corporation does not expect such payment to have a material impact on the value of our loss share asset and related true-up payment obligation to the FDIC.\nThe commercial shared-loss arrangement described above expired on June 30, 2015, but provides the FDIC with additional recovery sharing for three years thereafter. As of December 31, 2016, BPPR had unreimbursed loss claims related to the\ncommercial loss-sharing arrangement amounting to $5.5 million, reflected in the FDIC indemnification asset as a receivable from the FDIC, which are subject to the unresolved arbitration proceedings described above. Until these disputes are finally resolved, the terms of the commercial loss share agreement will remain in effect with respect to any such items under dispute. No assurance can be given that we will receive reimbursement from the FDIC with respect to the foregoing item, which, as in 2016, could require us to make a material adjustment to the value of our loss share asset and the related true up payment obligation to the FDIC and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results for the period in which such adjustment is taken.\nThe loss sharing agreement applicable to single-family residential mortgage loans provides for FDIC loss sharing and BPPR reimbursement to the FDIC for ten years (ending on June 30, 2020). As of December 31, 2016, the carrying value of covered loans (both commercial and residential) approximated $ 573 million, mainly comprised of single-family residential mortgage loans. To the extent that estimated losses on covered loans are not realized before the expiration of the applicable loss sharing agreement, such losses would not be subject to reimbursement from the FDIC and, accordingly, would require us to make a material adjustment in the value of our loss share asset and the related true-up payment obligation to the FDIC and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results for the period in which such adjustment is taken.\nOur acquisition of certain assets and deposits of Doral Bank from the FDIC as receiver could magnify certain of the risks our business already faces and could present new risks.\nOn February 27, 2015, BPPR, in an alliance with co-bidders, including BPNA, acquired certain assets and all deposits (other than certain brokered deposits) of Doral Bank from the FDIC, as receiver. Refer to Note 5 Business Combination for a description of the acquisition of certain assets and deposits of Doral Bank from the FDIC as Receiver. The transaction could magnify certain of the risks our business already faces that are described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and could present new risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nrisks associated with weak conditions in the economy and in the real estate markets in our geographic footprint, which adversely affect real estate prices, the job market, consumer confidence and spending habits, which may affect, among other things, the continued status of the loans we acquired as performing assets, charge-offs and provision expense;\n\u2022\nrisk associated with conditions of the taxi industry, including regulatory and competitive environment in New York City, which may affect Doral Bank\u2019s taxi medallion portfolio that we acquired;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with maintaining customer relationships, including managing any potential customer confusion caused by the alliance structure;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with the limited amount of diligence able to be conducted by a buyer in an FDIC transaction;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates and market liquidity which may reduce interest margins;\n\u2022\nchanges in market rates and prices that may adversely impact the value of financial assets and liabilities; and\n\u2022\nfailure to realize the anticipated acquisition benefits in the amounts and within the timeframes we expect.\nContrary to the case with the Westernbank transaction, we did not enter into a loss sharing agreement with the FDIC in connection with the Doral Bank transaction. Management made various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of acquired loan portfolios, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of secured loans. In estimating the extent of the losses, we analyze the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volume and classification of loans, volume and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals, local economic conditions, and other pertinent information. If our assumptions are incorrect, our actual losses could be higher than estimated and increased loss reserves may be needed to respond to different economic conditions or adverse developments in the acquired loan portfolio. Any increase in future loan losses could have a negative effect on our operating results.\nRISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES\nPotential issuance of additional shares of our Common Stock could further dilute existing holders of our Common Stock.\nThe potential issuance of additional shares of our Common Stock or common equivalent securities in future equity offerings would dilute the ownership interest of our existing common stockholders.\nDividends on our Common Stock and Preferred Stock may be suspended and stockholders may not receive funds in connection with their investment in our Common Stock or Preferred Stock without selling their shares.\nHolders of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. During 2009, we suspended dividend payments on our Common Stock and Preferred Stock. We resumed payment of dividends on our Preferred Stock in December 2010 and on our Common Stock in October 2015. There can be no assurance that any dividends will be declared on the Preferred Stock or Common Stock in any future periods. This could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock.\nAlso, we are a bank holding company and our ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain Federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board regarding capital adequacy and dividends. Moreover, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have issued policy statements stating that the bank holding companies and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. In the current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged dividend pay-out ratios that are at the 100% or higher level unless both asset quality and capital are very strong.\nIn addition, the terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities held by each trust that has issued trust preferred securities, prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our capital stock, including our Common Stock and Preferred Stock, or from purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment on such stock, if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing.\nAccordingly, shareholders may have to sell some or all of their shares of our Common Stock or Preferred Stock in order to generate cash flow from their investment. Shareholders may not realize a gain on their investment when they sell the Common Stock or Preferred Stock and may lose the entire amount of their investment.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS\nCyber-attacks, system risks and data protection breaches could present significant reputational, legal and regulatory costs.\nPopular is under continuous threat of cyber-attacks especially as we continue to expand customer services via the internet and other remote service channels. The most significant cyber-attack risks that we may face are e-fraud, denial-of-service and computer intrusion that might result in loss of sensitive customer data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals breach and extract funds from customer or bank accounts. Denial-of-service disrupts services available to our customers through our on-line banking system. Computer intrusion attempts might result in the breach of sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, and could present significant reputational, legal and/or regulatory costs to Popular if successful. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of the threats from organized cybercriminals and hackers, and our plans to continue to provide e-banking and mobile banking services to our customers. We have not, to date, experienced any material losses as a result of cyber-attacks.\nIf personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information of customers in our possession were to be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, including those of EVERTEC, or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, information security, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. Our main provider of these components is EVERTEC. While we have selected these third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, failure of a vendor to notify us of a reportable event, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor, including EVERTEC, as discussed below, could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor\u2019s ability to serve us. Replacing these third-party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations.\nHurricanes and other weather-related events, as well as man-made disasters, could cause a disruption in our operations or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nA significant portion of our operations are located in a region susceptible to hurricanes. Such weather events can cause disruption to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations. We maintain hurricane insurance, including coverage for lost profits and extra expense; however, there is no insurance against the disruption to the markets that we serve that a catastrophic hurricane could produce. Further, a hurricane in any of our market areas could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to timely repay their loans and may adversely impact the value of any collateral held by us. Man-made disasters and other events connected with the regions in which we operate could have similar effects. The severity and impact of future hurricanes and other weather-related events are difficult to predict and may be exacerbated by global climate change. The effects of future hurricanes and other weather-related events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH EVERTEC\nWe are dependent on EVERTEC for certain of our core financial transaction processing and information technology services, which exposes us to a number of operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn connection with the sale of a 51% ownership interest in EVERTEC in the third quarter of 2010, we entered into a long-term Amended and Restated Master Services Agreement (the \u201cMSA\u201d) with EVERTEC, pursuant to which we agreed to receive from EVERTEC, on an exclusive basis, certain core financial transaction processing and information technology services, including future modifications and enhancements to such services. The term of the MSA extends until September 30, 2025. Under the MSA, we also granted EVERTEC a right of first refusal to create new services or products that we determine to offer to our customers and certain other processing services. We also entered into several other agreements, generally coterminous with the MSA, pursuant to which BPPR agreed to sponsor EVERTEC as an independent sales organization with respect to certain credit card associations, agreed to certain exclusivity and non-solicitation restrictions with respect to merchant services, and agreed to support the ATH brand and network, among other matters. As a result, we are now dependent on EVERTEC for the provision of essential services to our business, including our core banking business, and there can be no assurances that the quality of the services will be appropriate or that EVERTEC will be able to continue to provide us with the necessary financial transaction processing and technology services. As a result, our relationship with EVERTEC exposes us to a number of operational and business risks that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nMoreover, as a result of our agreements with EVERTEC, we are particularly exposed to the operational risks of EVERTEC, including those relating to a breakdown or failure of EVERTEC\u2019s systems, as a result of security breaches or attacks, employee error or malfeasance, system breakdowns, or otherwise. Over the term of the MSA, we have experienced various interruptions and delays in key services provided by EVERTEC. Future interruptions in the operation of EVERTEC\u2019s information systems, or breaches to the confidentiality of the information that resides in such systems, could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services and damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to recover from EVERTEC for breach of the MSA may not fully compensate us for the damages we may suffer as a result of such breach.\nIf EVERTEC is unable to meet constant technological changes and evolving industry standards, we may be unable to enhance our current services and introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, placing us at a competitive disadvantage and significantly affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe banking and financial services industry is rapidly evolving and it is highly competitive on the basis of the quality and variety of products and services offered, innovation, price and other factors. In order to compete effectively, we need to constantly develop enhancements to our product and service offerings and introduce new products and services that keep pace with developments in the financial services industry and satisfy shifting customer needs and preferences. These enhancements and new products and services require the delivery of technology services by EVERTEC pursuant to the MSA, making our success dependent on EVERTEC\u2019s ability to timely complete and introduce these enhancements and new products and services in a cost-effective manner.\nSome of our competitors rely on financial services technology and outsourcing companies that are much larger than EVERTEC and that may have better technological capabilities and product offerings. Furthermore, EVERTEC is highly leveraged, which, besides exposing it to a number of financial and business risks, requires it to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow to meeting debt service requirements, reducing its operational flexibility and ability to invest resources in capital and other expenditures to improve and develop its business services in a constantly changing environment. In addition, financial services technology companies typically make capital investments to develop and modify their product and service offerings to facilitate their customers\u2019 compliance with the extensive and evolving regulatory and industry requirements, and in most cases such costs are borne by the technology provider. Because of our relationship with EVERTEC, however, we bear the full cost of such developments and modifications pursuant to the MSA.\nIf EVERTEC\u2019s technology services are not competitive in terms of price, speed and scalability versus comparable offerings from larger companies, our future success may be adversely affected. Furthermore, if our relationship with EVERTEC hinders our ability to compete successfully, including by satisfying shifting customer needs and preferences through enhancements to our existing products and services and the introduction of new products and services that keep pace with developments in the financial services industry, our ability to attract and retain customers and to match products and services offered by competitors could be impaired and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur ability to transition to a new financial services technology provider, and to replace the other services that are provided to us by EVERTEC, may be lengthy and complex.\nSwitching from one vendor of core bank processing and related technology services to a new vendor is a complex process that carries business and financial risks, even where such a switch can be accomplished without violating our contractual obligations to EVERTEC. The implementation cycle for such a transition can be lengthy and require significant financial and management resources from us. Such a transition can also expose us, and our clients, to increased costs (including conversion costs) and business disruption. If we decided to transition to a new financial services technology provider, either at the end of the term of the MSA and related agreements or earlier upon the occurrence of a termination event, these potential transition risks could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although EVERTEC has agreed to provide certain transition assistance to us in connection with the termination of the MSA, we are ultimately dependent on their ability to provide those services in a responsive and competent manner.\nUnder the MSA we are required to provide written notice of non-renewal not less than one year prior to the relevant termination date in order to avoid an automatic three-year renewal. In practice, however, if we decided to switch to a new provider, we would have to commence procuring and working on a transition process much earlier. Furthermore, if we were unsuccessful or decided not to complete the transition after expending significant funds and management resources, it could also result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe value of our remaining ownership interest in EVERTEC, and the revenues we derive from EVERTEC, could be materially reduced if we decided not to renew our agreements with EVERTEC or were to terminate them before the expiration of their term.\nWe continue to have a 16.05% ownership interest in EVERTEC and account for this investment under the equity method. As such, we include our investment in EVERTEC in other assets and our proportionate share of income or loss is included in other operating income in our consolidated statements of operations. For 2016, our share of EVERTEC\u2019s changes in equity recognized in income was $11.2 million. The carrying value of our investment in EVERTEC was, as of December 31, 2016, approximately $38.9 million. Meanwhile, the services EVERTEC delivers to us represent a significant portion of EVERTEC\u2019s revenues (approximately 45% for 2016). As a result, if we were not to renew the MSA and our other agreements with EVERTEC, or otherwise terminate them before the end of their term, EVERTEC\u2019s financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the value of our remaining ownership interest in EVERTEC, and the income we report from this investment, may be materially reduced. Furthermore, revenue from EVERTEC\u2019s merchant acquiring business, which constitutes approximately 23% of EVERTEC\u2019s revenues, depends, in part, on EVERTEC\u2019s alliance with BPPR. If such relationship were to suffer, EVERTEC\u2019s business may be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, future sales of our EVERTEC common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of EVERTEC common stock and thus the value we may be able to realize on the sale of our remaining holdings.\nFor further information of other risks faced by Popular please refer to the Management\u2019s Discussion & Analysis section of the Annual Report.", "PERMNO": 16505, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BPOP"}
