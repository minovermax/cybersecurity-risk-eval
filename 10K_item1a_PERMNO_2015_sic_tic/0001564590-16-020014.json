Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider these risks as well as the other information we include or incorporate by reference in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes. The risks and uncertainties we have described are not the only ones we face. If any of these risks materializes, the trading price of our common stock could fall and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThis section includes or refers to forward-looking statements. You should read the explanation of the qualifications and limitations of such forward-looking statements discussed at the beginning of the report.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we fail to obtain and maintain necessary governmental approvals for our products and indications, we may be unable to market and sell our products in certain jurisdictions.\nMedical devices such as ours are extensively regulated by the FDA in the U.S. and by other federal, state, local and foreign authorities. Governmental regulations relate to the testing, development, manufacturing, labeling, design, sale, promotion, distribution, importing, exporting and shipping of our products. In the U.S., before we can market a new medical device, or a new use of, or claim for, or significant modification to, an existing product, we must generally first receive PMA approval from the FDA. This process can be expensive and lengthy and entail significant expenses, primarily related to clinical trials. It generally takes between one to three years to receive approval, or even longer, from the time the PMA application is submitted to the FDA. Regulatory clearances or approvals, either foreign or domestic, may not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approvals or clearances for use of our products under development, or if the patient populations for which they are approved are not sufficiently broad, the commercial success of these products could be limited. The FDA may also limit the claims that we can make about our products. Our medical devices are now subject to the PMA and HDE processes. In December 2012, as part of the FDA\u2019s 515 Program Initiative, an FDA panel voted to recommend continuation of Class III status for temporary ventricular support devices within the non-roller type cardiopulmonary bypass blood pumps category, which includes our Impella products. PMA or HDE approval requires that any significant modifications to the design, materials, or intended use of those devices require FDA approval through PMA or HDE supplemental applications, and the devices will be subject to more burdensome regulatory reporting requirements than they had been as 510(k) cleared devices.\nIf we do not receive FDA approval or clearance for one or more of our products, we will be unable to market and sell those products in the U.S., which would have a material adverse effect on our operations and prospects.\nWe intend to market our products in international markets, including the European Union, Canada, and Japan. Approval processes differ among those jurisdictions and approval in the U.S. or any other single jurisdiction does not guarantee approval in any other jurisdiction. Obtaining foreign approvals could involve significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could require additional clinical trials.\nIf the FDA or another regulatory or enforcement agency determines that we have promoted off-label use of our products, we may be subject to various penalties, including civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, and other regulatory or enforcement agencies actively enforce regulations prohibiting promotion of medical devices for unapproved uses. If any such agency determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. Although our policy is to refrain from statements that could be considered off-label promotion of our products, such agencies could disagree and conclude that we have engaged in off-label promotion.\nOn October 26, 2012, we were informed that the Department of Justice, United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia was conducting an investigation (\u201cMarketing and Labeling Investigation\u201d) focused on our marketing and labeling of the Impella 2.5 heart pump. On October 31, 2012, we accepted service of a subpoena related to this investigation seeking documents and other materials related to the Impella 2.5 device. We cooperated fully with the Marketing and Labeling Investigation, and on June 29,\n2015, we received confirmation that the Department of Justice had closed the Marketing and Labeling Investigation without taking enforcement action.\nWe may not be able to resolve these matters, or any similar matters that may come up in the future, without incurring penalties or facing significant consequences. Even if we are successful in resolving this matter without incurring penalties, responding to the subpoena has resulted and in the future could result in substantial costs and could significantly and adversely impact our reputation and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and ability to finance our operations.\nOff-label use of our products may result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business.\nThe use of our products outside the indications cleared for use, or \u201coff-label use,\u201d may increase the risk of injury to patients. Clinicians may use our products for off-label uses, as the FDA does not restrict or regulate a clinician\u2019s choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. Off-label use of our products may increase the risk of product liability claims against us. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our management\u2019s attention and result in substantial damage awards against us.\nWe have historically been named as a party to purported stockholder class actions and a derivative action, and we may be named in additional litigation in the future, which may require significant management time and attention, and result in significant legal expenses and may result in an unfavorable outcome, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOn June 10, 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, or the First Circuit, affirmed the dismissal by the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, or the District Court, of a previously disclosed complaint brought by an alleged stockholder as a derivative action instituted on our behalf against each of our directors. The complaint alleged that the directors breached their fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders in connection with disclosures related to our marketing and labeling of our Impella 2.5 product and sought damages in an unspecified amount. On February 6, 2015, the First Circuit, affirmed the dismissal by the District Court of a previously disclosed complaint brought by alleged purchasers of our common stock, on behalf of themselves and persons or entities that purchased or acquired our common stock between August 5, 2011 and October 31, 2012. The complaint related to two previously reported complaints that were filed on November 16 and 19, 2012 and alleged that we and certain of our officers violated federal securities laws in connection with disclosures related to our marketing and labeling of the Impella 2.5 product and sought damages in an unspecified amount. We do not expect any further activity related to this matter or the derivative action.\nWe may continue to be the subject of class action or derivative actions, which we intend to defend vigorously. We cannot be assured, however, that we will be successful. We may have to pay damage awards, indemnify our officers and directors from damage awards that may be entered against them or otherwise may enter into settlement arrangements in connection with such claims. Any such payments or settlement arrangements could have material adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial condition. Even if the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are not successful, defending litigation could result in substantial costs and significantly and adversely impact our reputation and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and ability to finance our operations.\nOur current and planned clinical trials may not begin on time, or at all, and may not be completed on schedule, or at all.\nIn order to obtain PMA approval and in some cases, 510(k) clearance, we may be required to conduct well-controlled clinical trials designed to test the safety and effectiveness of the product. In order to conduct clinical studies, we must receive an investigational device exemption, or IDE, in effect for each investigational device. An IDE allows us to use an investigational device in a clinical trial to collect data on safety and effectiveness that will support an application for PMA or 510(k) clearance from the FDA.\nConducting clinical trials is a long, expensive and uncertain process that is subject to delays and failure at any stage. Clinical trials can take months or years to complete. The commencement or completion of any of our clinical trials may be delayed or halted for numerous reasons, including:\n\u00b7\nthe FDA may not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or may place a clinical trial on hold;\n\u00b7\nsubjects may not enroll in clinical trials at the rate we expect and/or subjects may not be followed-up on at the rate we expect;\n\u00b7\nsubjects may experience adverse side effects or events related or unrelated to our products;\n\u00b7\nthird-party clinical investigators may not perform our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol and good clinical practices, or other third-party organizations may not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u00b7\nthe interim results of any of our clinical trials may be inconclusive or negative;\n\u00b7\nregulatory inspections of our clinical trials may require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials if investigators find us not to be in compliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\navailability of our devices may have the effect of slowing down the progress of related clinical trials since physicians can use our devices commercially outside of the trials;\n\u00b7\nour manufacturing process may not produce finished products that conform to design and performance specifications expected with the clinical trial; or\n\u00b7\ngovernmental regulations or administrative actions may change and impose new requirements, particularly with respect to reimbursement for products used in clinical trials.\nThe results of pre-clinical studies do not necessarily predict future clinical trial results and previous clinical trial results may not be repeated in subsequent clinical trials. We may suffer delays and cost overruns, and terminate manufacturing of certain of our products despite achieving promising results in pre-clinical testing or early clinical testing. In addition, the data obtained from clinical trials may be inadequate to support approval or clearance of a submission. The FDA may disagree with our interpretation of the data from our clinical trials, or may find the clinical trial design, conduct or results inadequate to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate. The FDA may also require us to conduct additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials which could further delay approval of our products. The FDA or other international regulatory agencies will require post-market studies which can be burdensome and expensive.\nIn March 2015, we received PMA approval from the FDA for our Impella 2.5 device during elective and urgent high-risk PCI procedures. The Impella 2.5 is the first hemodynamic support device to receive a PMA indication for use during high-risk PCI procedures, demonstrating its safety and effectiveness for this complex patient population. Under this PMA, the Impella 2.5 is approved for temporary (up to six hours) ventricular support device indicated for use during high-risk PCI performed in elective or urgent hemodynamically stable patients with severe coronary artery disease and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, when a heart team, including a cardiac surgeon, has determined high-risk PCI is the appropriate therapeutic option. Use of the Impella 2.5 device in these patients may prevent hemodynamic instability that may occur during planned temporary coronary occlusions and may reduce periprocedural and post-procedural adverse events. The approved product labeling allows for a clinical decision to leave the Impella 2.5 device in place beyond the intended duration of up to six hours due to unforeseen circumstances. Per our PMA approval, we will conduct a single-arm, post-approval study on the Impella 2.5 device, collecting data on high-risk PCI patients. The study will be a prospective, multi-center study comprised of 369 patients from 70 sites supported with the Impella 2.5 system. The Impella 2.5 device has CE Mark approval in Europe for up to five days of use and is approved for use in over 40 countries.\nIn August 2015, we submitted a PMA supplement requesting to expand our current Impella 2.5 PMA approval to include additional indications for the Impella 2.5 product and also to include all of our other Impella devices (Impella CP, Impella 5.0 and Impella LD) that support the left side of the heart. These submissions are for a set of indications related to the use of the Impella devices in patients suffering cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial infarction or cardiac surgery and for a longer duration of support. In April 2016, the FDA approved the PMA supplement for our Impella 2.5, Impella CP, Impella 5.0 and Impella LD heart pumps to provide treatment for ongoing cardiogenic shock. In this setting, the Impella heart pumps stabilize the patient\u2019s hemodynamics, unload the left ventricle, perfuse the end organs and allow for recovery of the native heart.\nIf we are unable to receive FDA approval of an IDE to conduct clinical trials or the trials are halted by the FDA or others or if we are unsuccessful in receiving FDA approval of a product candidate, we would not be able to sell or promote the product candidate in the U.S., which could seriously harm our business. Moreover, we face similar risks in each jurisdiction in which we sell or propose to sell our products. If we make modifications to a product, whether in response to results of clinical testing or otherwise, we could be required to start our clinical trials over, which could cause serious delays that would adversely affect our results of operations. Even modest changes to certain components of our products could result in months or years of additional clinical trials.\nOur products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements, including continuing regulatory review, which could affect the manufacturing and marketing of our products.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies continue to review products even after they have received initial approval. If and when the FDA or another regulatory agency clears or approves our products under development, the manufacture and marketing of these products will be subject to continuing regulation, post approval clinical studies, including compliance with the FDA\u2019s adverse event\nreporting requirements, prohibitions on promoting a product for unapproved uses, and Quality System Regulation, or QSR, requirements, which obligate manufacturers, including third-party and contract manufacturers, to adhere to stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the design and manufacture of a device.\nAny modification to an FDA approved device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a supplemental PMA or HDE approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine in the first instance whether a modification requires approval, but the FDA may review and potentially disagree with any such decision. Modifications of this type are common with new products. We anticipate that the first generation of each of our products will undergo a number of changes, refinements, enhancements and improvements over time. If the FDA requires us to seek approval for modification of a previously cleared product for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and competitive position. We also cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining clearances or approvals for our modifications, if required. We and our third-party suppliers of product components are also subject to inspection and market surveillance by the FDA and other regulatory agencies for QSR and our regulatory other requirements, the interpretation of which can change. Compliance with QSR and similar legal requirements can be difficult and expensive. Enforcement actions resulting from failure to comply with government requirements could result in fines, suspensions of approvals or clearances, recalls or seizure of products, operating restrictions or shutdown, and criminal prosecutions that could adversely affect the manufacture and marketing of our products. The FDA or another regulatory agency could withdraw a previously approved product from the market upon receipt of newly discovered information, including a failure to comply with regulatory requirements, the occurrence of unanticipated safety problems of other defects in products following approval, or other reasons, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nEven after receiving regulatory clearance or approval, our products may be subject to product recalls which could harm our reputation and divert our managerial and financial resources.\nThe FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to order mandatory recall of our products or order their removal from the market if the government finds that our products might cause adverse health consequences or death. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors by us or our suppliers or design defects, including labeling defects, or unanticipated safety problems. We have in the past initiated voluntary recalls of some of our products and we could do so in the future. Any recall of our products may harm our reputation with customers and divert managerial and financial resources.\nWe depend on third-party reimbursement to our customers for market acceptance of our products. If third-party payers fail to provide coverage and appropriate levels of reimbursement for purchase and use of our products, our sales and profitability would be adversely affected.\nSales of medical devices largely depend on the reimbursement of patients\u2019 medical expenses by government healthcare programs and private health insurers. Without the financial support of government reimbursement or third-party insurers\u2019 payments for patient care, the market for our products will be limited. Medical products and devices incorporating new technologies are closely examined by governments and private insurers to determine whether the products and devices will be covered by reimbursement, and if so, the level of reimbursement which may apply.\nWe cannot be sure that additional third-party payers will cover and/or adequately reimburse use of our products or other products under development, to enable us to sell them at profitable prices.\nIn addition, third-party payers increasingly are requiring evidence that medical devices are cost-effective and if we are unable to meet this requirement, the third-party payer may not reimburse the use of our products, which could reduce sales of our products to healthcare providers who depend upon reimbursement for payment. We also cannot be sure that third-party payers will continue the current levels of reimbursement to physicians and medical centers for use of our products. Any reduction in the amount of this reimbursement could harm our business.\nChanges in healthcare reimbursement systems in the U.S. and abroad could reduce our revenues and profitability.\nIn March 2010, the federal government enacted healthcare reform legislation. The legislation has made changes to the manner in which many healthcare services are provided and paid for in the U.S. These changes may impact reimbursement for healthcare services, including reimbursement to hospitals and physicians. States may also enact further legislation that impacts Medicaid payments to hospitals and physicians. In addition, CMS, the federal agency responsible for administering the Medicare program in the U.S., has established payment levels for hospitals and physicians in line with the legislation, which can increase or decrease payment to such entities.\nIn general, such healthcare reforms put greater responsibility for controlling healthcare costs on providers, which may have the effect of causing providers to control costs more closely. The healthcare reform legislation and any future legislative, regulatory and reimbursement initiatives or changes to the reimbursement for our products could adversely affect demand for our products and have a material adverse impact on our revenues. Our business and results of operations could therefore be adversely affected by the healthcare reform legislation as well as future healthcare reform or regulatory actions.\nInternationally, medical reimbursement systems vary significantly from country to country, with some countries limiting medical centers spending through fixed budgets, regardless of levels of patient treatment, and other countries requiring application for, and approval of, government or third-party reimbursement. Even if we succeed in bringing our new products to market, uncertainties regarding future healthcare policy, legislation and regulation, as well as private market practices, could affect our ability to sell our products in commercially acceptable quantities at profitable prices.\nWe must comply with healthcare \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d laws, and we could face substantial penalties for non-compliance and be excluded from government healthcare programs, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights may be applicable to our business. We may be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u00b7\nThe federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce (i) the referral of an individual, for an item or service, or (ii) the recommending, purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u00b7\nThe federal False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, including claims made pursuant to an unlawful kickback, and which may apply to entities like us that promote medical devices, provide medical device management services and may provide coding and billing advice to customers;\n\u00b7\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters and which also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and\n\u00b7\nState law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ in significant ways from state to state and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nAdditionally, the compliance environment is changing, with more states, such as California, Connecticut, Nevada and Massachusetts, mandating implementation of compliance programs, compliance with industry ethics codes, and spending limits, and other states, such as Vermont, requiring reporting to state governments of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or PPSA, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010, requires U.S. manufacturers of drug, device, biologics, and medical supplies covered under Medicare, Medicaid, or State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP, to report payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals on an annual basis to the government. These laws all provide for penalties for non-compliance. The shifting regulatory environment, along with the requirement to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different and difficult compliance and reporting requirements, increases the possibility that we may run afoul of one or more laws. The costs to comply with these regulatory requirements are becoming more expensive and will also impact our profitability.\nMany of these requirements are new and their application is uncertain, and regulatory guidance is limited. We could face enforcement action, fines and other penalties and could receive adverse publicity, all of which could harm our business, if it is alleged that we have failed to fully comply with such laws and regulations. Similarly, if the physicians or other providers or entities that we do business with are found not to comply with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions, which could also have a negative impact on our business.\nOn April 25, 2014, we received a subpoena from the Boston regional office of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, Office of Inspector General requesting materials relevant to our reimbursement of expenses and remuneration to healthcare providers for a six month period from July 2012 through December 2012 in connection with the FCA Investigation. We submitted the requested documents to HHS and believe that we substantially complied with the subpoena. On November 6, 2014, we received notice from the Department of Justice, United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Massachusetts in the form of a CID requesting additional materials relating to this matter for the time period of January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2013. We have responded to the additional requests for information contained in the CID, and are in the process of responding to other informal requests. We intend to continue to cooperate with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in connection with the FCA Investigation.\nWe depend on Impella\u00ae products for a significant portion of our revenues.\nWe derive, and expect to continue to derive in the near future, almost all of our revenues from sales of our Impella products. While we cannot fully predict what level of revenues our Impella products will generate, we anticipate that Impella product sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future. Implementation of our business strategy depends on continued sales of our Impella products. Our ability to generate sales of our Impella products may be impaired by the factors described below:\n\u00b7\nour failure to obtain approvals from the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities or to comply with government regulations, or the withdrawal of market clearance or the taking of other enforcement actions;\n\u00b7\nlack of acceptance or continued acceptance by physicians;\n\u00b7\nour reliance on specialized suppliers for certain components and materials;\n\u00b7\nmanufacturing or quality control problems;\n\u00b7\nour inability to protect our proprietary technologies or an infringement of others\u2019 patents;\n\u00b7\nthe loss of a distributor or a distributor\u2019s failure to perform its obligations;\n\u00b7\nour failure to compete successfully against our existing or potential competitors;\n\u00b7\nadditional risks associated with selling in international markets;\n\u00b7\nlong and variable sales and deployment cycles;\n\u00b7\nfailure by third-party payers to provide appropriate levels of reimbursement for hospitals and physicians using our products;\n\u00b7\nour failure to comply with federal and state regulations; and\n\u00b7\nproduct liability claims.\nIf we fail to compete successfully against our existing or potential competitors, our sales or operating results may be harmed.\nCompetition from other companies offering circulatory care products is intense and subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry requirements and standards. We compete with companies that have substantially greater or broader financial, product development, sales and marketing resources and experience than we do. Our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to distinguish our company and our products from our competitors and their products. Factors affecting our competitive position include:\n\u00b7\nthe availability of other products and procedures that are technically equivalent or superior to our products, and which may be sold at lower prices;\n\u00b7\nproduct performance and design;\n\u00b7\nproduct safety;\n\u00b7\nsales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u00b7\ncomparable clinical outcomes;\n\u00b7\nsuccess and timing of new product development and introductions;\n\u00b7\nphysician acceptance of our products;\n\u00b7\npenetration into existing and new geographic markets; and\n\u00b7\nintellectual property protection.\nOur customers are primarily hospitals that have limited budgets. As a result, our products compete against a broad range of medical devices and other therapies for these limited funds. Our success will depend in large part upon our ability to enhance our existing products, to develop new products to meet regulatory and customer requirements and to achieve market acceptance for our products. We believe that important competitive factors with respect to the development and commercialization of our products include the relative speed with which we can develop products, establish clinical utility, complete clinical trials and regulatory approval processes, obtain and protect reimbursement, maintain cost effectiveness for our products, and supply commercial quantities of our products to our customers.\nAdvances in medical technology, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals may reduce the size of the potential markets for our products or render our products obsolete. We are aware of other heart replacement device research efforts in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Japan. In addition, there are a number of companies; including Getinge, Abbott Laboratories, St. Jude Medical, Inc., CardiacAssist, HeartWare International, Terumo Heart and several early-stage companies, that are developing heart assist products, including implantable left ventricular assist devices and miniaturized rotary ventricular assist devices.\nIf we do not effectively manage our growth, we may be unable to successfully develop, market and sell our products.\nOur future revenue and operating results will depend on our ability to manage the anticipated growth of our business. We have experienced significant growth in recent years in the scope of our operations and we have increased our employee headcount. This growth has placed significant demands on our management as well as our financial and operations resources. In order to achieve our business objectives, we will need to continue to grow. However, continued growth presents numerous challenges, including:\n\u00b7\ndeveloping our global sales and marketing infrastructure and capabilities;\n\u00b7\nexpanding manufacturing capacity, maintaining quality and increasing production;\n\u00b7\nincreasing our foreign and domestic regulatory compliance capabilities;\n\u00b7\nimplementing appropriate operational, financial and IT systems and internal controls;\n\u00b7\nidentifying, attracting and retaining qualified personnel, particularly experienced clinical staff; and\n\u00b7\nhiring, training, managing and supervising our personnel worldwide.\nAny failure to manage our growth effectively could impede our ability to successfully develop, market and sell our products, which could seriously harm our business.\nThe demand for some of our products and products under development is unproven, and we may be unable to successfully commercialize our products.\nOur products and products under development may not enjoy commercial acceptance or success, which could adversely affect our business and operational results. We need to create markets for our Impella products and other existing products, as well as other new or future products, including achieving market acceptance among physicians, hospitals, patients and third-party payers. In particular, we need to gain acceptance of our Impella products among interventional cardiologists. The obstacles we will face in trying to create successful commercial markets for our products include:\n\u00b7\nlimitations inherent in first-generation devices, and our potential inability to develop successive improvements, including increases in service life and improvements in the ease of use of our products;\n\u00b7\nintroduction by other companies of new treatments, products and technologies that compete with our products;\n\u00b7\ntiming and amount of reimbursement for these products, if any, by third-party payers;\n\u00b7\npotential reluctance of clinicians to obtain adequate training to use our products;\n\u00b7\ncost of our products; and\n\u00b7\npotential reluctance of physicians, patients and society as a whole to accept medical devices that replace or assist the heart and risk of mechanical failure inherent in such devices.\nOur future success depends in part on the development of new circulatory assist products, and our development efforts may not be successful.\nWe are devoting most of our research and development and regulatory efforts, and significant financial resources, to the development of our Impella products and product extensions of existing commercial products and new products. In July 2014, we acquired ECP, a German company engaged in the research, development, prototyping and pre-serial production of a percutaneous expandable catheter pump which increases blood circulation from the heart with an external drive shaft. The development of new products and product extensions presents enormous challenges in a variety of areas, including blood compatible surfaces, blood compatible flow, manufacturing techniques, pumping mechanisms, physiological control, energy transfer, anatomical fit and surgical techniques. We may be unable to overcome all of these challenges, which could adversely affect our results of operations and prospects and limit our ability to bring new products to market.\nThe commercial success of our products will require acceptance by surgeons and interventional cardiologists, a limited number of whom have significant influence over medical device selection and purchasing decisions.\nWe may achieve our business objectives only if our products are accepted and recommended by leading cardiovascular surgeons and interventional cardiologists, whose decisions are likely to be based on a determination by these clinicians that our products are safe and cost-effective and represent acceptable methods of treatment. Although we have developed relationships with leading cardiac surgeons, the commercial success of Impella and our other products will require that we also develop relationships with leading interventional cardiologists in cath labs. We cannot assure you that we can maintain our existing relationships and arrangements or that we can establish new relationships in support of our products. If cardiovascular surgeons and interventional cardiologists do not consider our products to be adequate for the treatment of our target cardiac patient population or if a sufficient number of these clinicians recommend and use competing products, it would seriously harm our business.\nExpansion into hospital cardiac centers that have not historically used our products may incur long sales and training cycles that may cause our product sales and operating results to vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter.\nOur products have lengthy sales cycles and we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant effort without making a sale. Even after making the decision to purchase our Impella products, our customers often deploy our products slowly or infrequently. In addition, cardiac centers that buy the majority of our products are usually led by cardiac surgeons who are heavily recruited by competing hospitals or by hospitals looking to increase their profiles. When one of these surgeons moves to a new hospital we sometimes experience a temporary but significant reduction in purchases by the hospital from which the physician has departed while it replaces the lead physician supporting our Impella products. As a result, our product sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. In addition, product purchases often lag initial expressions of interest in our product by new centers as training of the products and internal hospital administrative procedures are typically required prior to the initial implant procedures.\nThe training required for clinicians to use our products could reduce the market acceptance of our products and reduce our revenue.\nClinicians must be trained to use our products proficiently. It is critical to the success of our business that we ensure that there are a sufficient number of clinicians familiar with, trained on and proficient in the use of our products. Convincing clinicians to dedicate the time and energy necessary to obtain adequate training in the use of our products is challenging and we may not be successful in these efforts. If clinicians are not properly trained, they may misuse or ineffectively use our products. Any improper use of our products may result in unsatisfactory outcomes, patient injury, negative publicity or lawsuits against us, any of which could harm our reputation and affect future product sales. Furthermore, our inability to educate and train clinicians to use our products may lead to lower demand for our products.\nIf we are unable to develop additional, high-quality manufacturing capacity, our growth may be limited and our business could be seriously harmed.\nTo be successful, we believe we will need to increase our manufacturing capacity. We do not have experience in manufacturing our Impella products in the commercial quantities that might be required to meet potential demand, nor do we have experience manufacturing our other products in large quantities. We may encounter difficulties in scaling up manufacturing of our products, including problems related to product yields, quality control and assurance, component and service availability, dependable sources of supply, adequacy of internal control policies and procedures and lack of skilled personnel. If we cannot hire, train and retain enough experienced and capable scientific and technical workers, we may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our existing or future products on-time and at an acceptable cost, which could limit market acceptance of our products or otherwise damage our business. In order for our manufacturing to meet the expected demand for our Impella products, we have been implementing process\nimprovements on the Impella production line at our manufacturing facilities in Aachen, Germany and Danvers, Massachusetts to increase the output that we can produce at the facility. In addition to programs designed to further increase yield and capacity levels, we have expanded manufacturing employment in Aachen and Danvers and have increased manufacturing floor space in Danvers and Aachen. We have relocated selected Impella sub-assembly production to our manufacturing facility in Danvers, Massachusetts and with third party suppliers and we began production of the Impella CP device in Danvers to support manufacturing at our main Impella production facility in Aachen. We continue to work on initiatives to expand our Impella manufacturing capacity in both Aachen and Danvers. We are also working with our existing suppliers and new suppliers to ensure we are able to have sufficient inventory and sub assembly parts as we increase our manufacturing capability to support growing demand. We are also working on process improvements, such as certain automation techniques, to allow us to manufacture our products more efficiently. If we are unable to implement these process improvements on a timely basis, it could inhibit our revenue growth.\nAny failure to achieve and maintain the high manufacturing standards that our products require may seriously harm our business.\nOur products require precise, high-quality manufacturing. Achieving precision and quality control requires skill and diligence by our personnel as well as our vendors. Any failure to achieve and maintain these high manufacturing standards, including the incidence of manufacturing errors, design defects or component failures could result in patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously hurt our business. Despite our very high manufacturing standards, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of errors, defects or failures. If we or our vendors are unable to manufacture our products in accordance with necessary quality standards, or if we are unable to procure additional high-quality manufacturing facilities, our business and results of operations may be negatively affected.\nIf we cannot attract and retain key management, scientific, sales and other personnel we need, we will not be successful.\nWe depend heavily on the contributions of the principal members of our business, financial, technical, sales and support, regulatory and clinical, operating, manufacturing and administrative management and staff, many of whom would be difficult to replace. Our key personnel include our senior officers, many of whom have very specialized scientific, medical or operational knowledge. The loss of the service of any of the key members of our senior management team may significantly delay or prevent our achievement of our business objectives. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, consultants and advisors is critical to our success. For example, many of the members of our clinical staff are registered nurses with experience in the surgery suite or cath lab, of which only a limited number of whom seek employment with a company like ours. Competition for skilled and experienced personnel in the medical devices industry is intense. We face competition for skilled and experienced management, scientific, clinical, engineering and sales personnel from numerous medical device and life sciences companies, universities, governmental entities and other research institutions. If we lose the services of any of the principal members of our management and staff, or if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future, especially scientific and sales personnel, our business could be adversely affected.\nIf our suppliers cannot provide the components we require, our ability to manufacture our products could be harmed.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers to provide us with some components used in our existing products and products under development. For example, we outsource the manufacturing of most of our consoles other than final assembly and testing and the sterilization process for our products. Relying on third-party suppliers makes us vulnerable to component part failures or obsolescence and to interruptions in supply, either of which could impair our ability to conduct clinical tests or to ship our products to our customers on a timely basis. Using third-party vendors makes it difficult and sometimes impossible for us to test fully certain components, such as components on circuit boards, maintain quality control, manage inventory and production schedules and control production costs. Manufacturers of our product components may be required to comply with the FDA or other regulatory manufacturing regulations and to satisfy regulatory inspections in connection with the manufacture of the components. Any failure by a supplier to comply with applicable requirements could lead to a disruption in supply. Vendor lead times to supply us with ordered components vary significantly and often can exceed six months or more. Both now and as we expand our manufacturing capacity, we cannot be sure that our suppliers will furnish us required components when we need them or be able to provide us inventory materials to support our expected growth in demand for our products. These factors could make it more difficult for us to manufacture our products effectively and efficiently and could adversely impact our results of operations.\nSome of our suppliers may be the only source for a particular component, which makes us vulnerable to significant cost increases. We have many foreign suppliers for some of our parts in which we are subject to currency exchange rate volatility. Some of our vendors are small in size and may have difficulty supplying the quantity and quality of materials required for our products as our business grows. Vendors that are the sole source of certain products may decide to limit or eliminate sales of certain components due to product liability or other concerns and we might not be able to find a suitable replacement for those products. Our inventory may run out before we find alternative suppliers and we might be forced to purchase substantial inventory, if available, to last until we are able to qualify an alternate supplier. If we cannot obtain a necessary component, we may need to find, test and obtain regulatory approval or clearance for a replacement component, produce the component ourselves or redesign the related product, which would\ncause significant delay and could increase our manufacturing costs. Any of these events could adversely impact our results of operations.\nGeneral economic and political conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nExternal factors can affect our profitability and financial condition. Such external factors include general domestic and global economic conditions, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates and factors affecting global economic stability, and the political environment regarding healthcare in general. While the economic environment has shown some signs of improvement, the strength and timing of any economic recovery remains uncertain, and we cannot predict to what extent the global economic slowdown may negatively impact our business. For example, an increase in interest rates could result in an increase in our borrowing costs and could otherwise restrict our ability to access the capital markets. Negative conditions in the credit and capital markets could impair our ability to access the financial markets for working capital or other funds, and could negatively impact our ability to borrow. Such conditions could result in decreased liquidity and impairments in the carrying value of our investments, and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. These and other conditions could also adversely affect our customers, and may impact their ability or decision to purchase our products or make payments on a timely basis.\nWe do business with foreign governments outside the United States. A number of these countries, including certain European countries, have experienced deterioration in credit and economic conditions. These conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a reduction in the number of procedures that use our products and an increase in the average length of time that it takes to collect accounts receivable outstanding in these countries.\nWe may not be successful in expanding our direct sales activities into international markets.\nWe are seeking to expand our international sales of our products by recruiting direct sales and support teams outside the U.S. Our international operations in Germany, France, Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom are or will be subject to a number of risks, which may vary from the risks we experience in the U.S., including:\n\u00b7\nthe need to obtain regulatory approvals in foreign countries before our products may be sold or used;\n\u00b7\nthe need to procure reimbursement for our products in each foreign market;\n\u00b7\nthe generally lower level of reimbursement available in foreign markets relative to the U.S.;\n\u00b7\nthe requirement to work with distributors or other partners to sell our products;\n\u00b7\nlonger sales cycles;\n\u00b7\nlimited protection of intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty and delays in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u00b7\ndifferent income tax and sales tax environments;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in supporting patients using our products;\n\u00b7\ndifferent payroll, employee benefits and statutory requirements;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in the values of foreign currencies; and\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic instability.\nIf we are unable to effectively expand our sales activities in international markets, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nWe rely on distributors to sell our products in some international markets and poor performance by a distributor could reduce our sales and harm our business.\nWe rely on distributors to market and sell our products in certain parts of Europe, Asia, South America and the Middle East. Many of these distributors have the exclusive right to distribute our products in their territory. We may hire distributors to market our products in additional international markets in the future. Our success in these markets will depend almost entirely upon the efforts of our distributors, over whom we have little or no control. If a distributor does not market and sell our products aggressively and maintain a continued focus on the sale and distribution of our products up to our standards, we could lose sales and impair our ability to compete in that market. We are also subject to credit risk associated with shipments to our distributors and this could negatively impact our financial condition and liquidity in the future.\nMany of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are, either directly or indirectly, with governmental entities, and we could be adversely affected by violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws outside the U.S.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Many of our customer relationships outside of the United States are, either directly or indirectly, with governmental entities and employees (such as physicians) and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. Although our corporate policies mandate compliance with these anti- bribery laws, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have incurred losses in previous periods and it is possible that we may incur losses in future periods.\nWe have recognized net income of approximately $38.1 million, $113.7 million and $7.4 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The profitability we achieved in recent years may not be indicative of our ability to sustain profitability and it is possible that we may incur losses from operations in future periods. Any losses incurred in the future may result primarily from, among other things:\n\u00b7\nthe expansion of our global distribution network;\n\u00b7\ninvestments in new markets such as Japan;\n\u00b7\nongoing product and clinical development;\n\u00b7\ncosts related to new business development initiatives, such as potential acquisitions of businesses;\n\u00b7\nlegal expenses related to the FCA Investigation and patent related matters;\n\u00b7\ncosts associated with hiring additional personnel, performing clinical trials, continuing our research and development relating to our products under development, seeking regulatory approvals and, if we receive these approvals, commencing commercial manufacturing and marketing activities;\n\u00b7\nsignificant expenditures necessary to market and manufacture in commercial quantities our approved circulatory care products; and\n\u00b7\nthe amount of these expenditures is difficult to forecast accurately and cost overruns may occur.\nOur operating results may fluctuate unpredictably.\nHistorically, our annual and quarterly operating results have fluctuated widely and we expect these fluctuations to continue. Among the factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate are:\n\u00b7\nthe timing of customer orders and deliveries;\n\u00b7\ncompetitive changes, such as price changes or new product introductions that we or our competitors may make;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of regulatory actions, such as product approvals or recalls;\n\u00b7\ncosts we incur developing and testing our Impella heart pumps and other products;\n\u00b7\ncosts we incur in anticipation of future sales, such as inventory purchases, expansion of manufacturing facilities, or establishment of international sales offices;\n\u00b7\ncosts we incur in connection with the class action suits and derivative action that has been filed against us;\n\u00b7\ncosts we incur in connection with the investigation being conducted by the U.S. Department of Justice;\n\u00b7\nadditional taxes, such as the Medical Device tax;\n\u00b7\ntiming of certain marketing programs and events;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of physicians to use our products, as there are seasonal impacts, due to physician vacation or training events that limit their ability to be in the hospital to perform procedures that involve our products;\n\u00b7\nimpact of any businesses or technologies we may acquire in the future;\n\u00b7\neconomic conditions in the healthcare industry; and\n\u00b7\nefforts by governments, insurance companies and others to contain healthcare costs, including changes to reimbursement policies.\nWe believe that period-to-period comparisons of our historical results are not necessarily meaningful, and investors should not rely on them as an indication of our future performance. To the extent we experience the factors described above, our future operating results may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors from time to time, which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe may undergo an \u201cownership change\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which would limit our ability to utilize net operating losses from prior tax years.\nIf we undergo an \u201cownership change\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our ability to utilize net operating loss carry-forwards from prior years to reduce taxable income in future tax years might be limited by operation of the Internal Revenue Code, either by limiting the amount of net operating losses that can be utilized to offset taxable income in a given year, or in total over the entire carry-forward period. Certain changes in the ownership of our common stock may result in an ownership change sufficient to limit the availability of our net operating losses. We also have net operating loss carry-forwards in other countries outside of the U.S. and our ability to use those losses in the future to offset taxable income could be limited by tax regulations in those countries.\nWe may not have sufficient funds to develop and commercialize our new products or make acquisitions of desirable companies, products or technologies.\nThe development, manufacture and sale of any medical device is very expensive and we may require additional funds to make acquisitions of desirable companies, products or technologies. We cannot be sure that we will have the necessary funds to develop and commercialize our new products or acquire companies, products, or technologies, or that additional funds will be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain the necessary funding to support these efforts, our business may be adversely affected. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to finance our operations for the next fiscal year. We also may evaluate from time to time other financing alternatives as necessary to fund operations, and any equity or convertible debt financing may involve substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.\nWe own patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property and know-how that we believe gives us a competitive advantage. If we cannot protect our intellectual property and develop or otherwise acquire additional intellectual property, competition could force us to lower our prices, which could hurt our profitability.\nOur intellectual property rights are and will continue to be a critical component of our success. We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of intellectual property, including patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and domain name protection laws, as well as confidentiality agreements with our employees and others, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. If we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours.\nA substantial portion of our intellectual property rights relating to the Impella products and other products under development is in the form of trade secrets, rather than patents. Unlike patents, trade secrets are only recognized under applicable law if they are kept secret by restricting their disclosure to third parties. We protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge in part through confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants and other parties. However, certain consultants and third parties with whom we have business relationships, and to whom in some cases we have disclosed trade secrets and other proprietary knowledge, may also provide services to other parties in the medical device industry, including companies, universities and research organizations that are developing competing products. In addition, some of our former employees who were exposed to certain of our trade secrets and other proprietary knowledge in the course of their employment may seek employment with, and become employed by, our competitors. We cannot be assured that consultants, employees and other third parties with whom we have entered into confidentiality agreements will not breach the terms of such agreements by improperly using or disclosing our trade secrets or other proprietary knowledge, that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach, or that our trade secrets will not become known to or be independently developed by our competitors. The loss of trade secret protection for technologies or know-how relating to our product portfolio and products under development could adversely affect our business and our prospects.\nOur business position also depends in part on our ability to maintain and defend our existing patents and obtain, maintain, and defend additional patents and other intellectual property rights. We intend to seek additional patents, but our pending and future patent\napplications may not result in issued patents or be granted on a timely basis. In addition, issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products or provide us with any competitive advantage, including exclusivity in a particular product area. The scope of our patent claims also may vary between countries, as individual countries have distinctive patent laws. We may be subject to challenges by third parties regarding our intellectual property, including, among others, claims regarding validity, enforceability, scope and effective term. Patent prosecution, related proceedings, and litigation in the U.S. and in other countries may be expensive, time consuming and ultimately unsuccessful. In addition, patents issued by foreign countries may afford less protection than is available under U.S. patent law and may not adequately protect our proprietary information. Our competitors may independently develop proprietary technologies and processes that are the same as or substantially equivalent to ours or design around our patents. Our competition may also hold or obtain intellectual property rights that would threaten our ability to develop or commercialize our product offerings. The expiration of patents on which we rely for protection of key products could diminish our competitive advantage and adversely affect our business and our prospects.\nCompanies in the medical device industry typically obtain patents and frequently engage in substantial intellectual property litigation. Our products and technologies could infringe on the rights of others. If a third-party successfully asserts a claim for infringement against us, we may be liable for substantial damages, be unable to sell products using that technology, or have to seek a license or redesign the related product. These alternatives may be uneconomical or impossible. Intellectual property litigation could be costly, result in product development delays and divert the efforts and attention of management from our business.\nIn July and August 2015, Thoratec Corporation (\u201cThoratec\u201d), acquired by St. Jude Medical, Inc. in October 2015, brought actions in connection with two of our patents relevant to Thoratec\u2019s HeartMate PHP medical device (\u201cPHP\u201d). In those proceedings, which are in the United Kingdom and Germany, Thoratec asserts that the two patents are invalid. In September 2015, we filed counterclaims to the action in Germany asserting that the PHP product infringes the two patents and two other patents owned by us. Both the Germany and United Kingdom proceedings are ongoing.\nIn December 2015, we received a letter from Maquet Cardiovascular LLC, a subsidiary of the Getinge Group (\u201cMaquet\u201d), and maker of the intra-aortic balloon pump, asserting that our Impella products infringe certain guidewire, lumen and sensor claims of two Maquet patents and one pending patent application that Maquet has filed in the U.S. and elsewhere, and encouraged us to discuss taking a license from Maquet. In January 2016, we responded to Maquet stating that we believed that the cited claims were invalid and that our Impella products did not infringe the cited patents. In May 2016, Maquet sent a second letter notifying us that the pending patent application had been issued as a U.S. patent and repeated their earlier assertion and encouraged us to discuss taking a license from Maquet. On May 19, 2016, we filed suit in Massachusetts District Court against Maquet seeking a declaratory judgment that our Impella products do not infringe Maquet\u2019s cited patent rights.\nProduct liability claims could damage our reputation and adversely affect our financial results.\nThe clinical use of medical products, even after regulatory approval, poses an inherent risk of product liability claims. We maintain limited product liability insurance coverage, subject to certain deductibles and exclusions. We cannot be sure that product liability insurance will be available in the future or will be available on acceptable terms or at reasonable costs, or that such insurance will provide us with adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Claims against us, regardless of their merit or potential outcome, may also hurt our ability to obtain physician endorsement of our products or expand our business. As we continue to introduce more products and our products are used more widely, we face an increased risk that a product liability claim will be brought against us.\nSome of our products are designed for patients who suffer from late-stage or end-stage heart failure, and many of these patients do not survive, even when supported by our products. There are many factors beyond our control that could result in patient death, including the condition of the patient prior to use of the product, the skill and reliability of physicians and hospital personnel using and monitoring the product and product maintenance by customers. However, the failure of the products we distribute for clinical testing or sale could give rise to product liability claims and negative publicity.\nThe risk of product liability claims is heightened when we sell products that are intended to support a patient until the end of life. The finite life of our products, as well as complications associated with their use, could give rise to product liability claims whether or not the products have extended or improved the quality of a patient\u2019s life. If we have to pay product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage, our financial condition will be adversely affected.\nQuality problems can result in substantial costs and inventory write-downs.\nGovernment regulations require us to track materials used in the manufacture of our products, so that if a problem is identified in one product it can be traced to other products that may have the same problem. An identified quality problem may require reworking or scrapping related inventory and recalling previous shipments. Because a malfunction in our products can be life-\nthreatening, we may be required to recall and replace, free of charge, products already in the marketplace. Any quality problem could cause us to incur significant expenses, lead to significant write-offs, injure our reputation and harm our business and financial results.\nDisruptions of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems could harm our business, customer relations and financial condition.\nWe rely in part on information technology to store information, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy, secure our data and accurately produce our financial statements. If our information technology systems do not effectively and securely collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies or human error, our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations would be materially impaired. Any such impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and the timeliness with which we report our operating results.\nOur business requires us to use and store customer, vendor, employee and business partner and, in certain instances patient, personally identifiable information. We are subject to various domestic and international privacy and security regulations, including but not limited to HIPAA, which mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. In addition, many states have enacted comparable laws addressing the privacy and security of health information, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA. If we fail to comply with these standards, we could be subject to criminal penalties and civil sanctions.\nWhile we devote significant resources to network security, data encryption and other security measures to protect our systems and data, including our own proprietary information and the confidential and personally identifiable information of our customers, employees, business partners and patients, these measures cannot provide absolute security. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful, resulting potentially in the theft, loss, destruction or corruption of information we store electronically, as well as unexpected interruptions, delays or cessation of service, any of which could cause harm to our business operations. Moreover, if a computer security breach or cyber-attack affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of proprietary or personally identifiable information, our reputation could be materially damaged and our operations could be impaired. We would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we acquire other companies or businesses, we will be subject to risks that could hurt our business.\nWe may pursue acquisitions to obtain complementary businesses, products or technologies. Any such acquisition may not produce the revenues, earnings or business synergies that we anticipate and an acquired business, product or technology might not perform as we expect. Our management could spend a significant amount of time, effort and money in identifying, pursuing and completing the acquisition. If we complete an acquisition, we may encounter significant difficulties and incur substantial expenses in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired company into our operations. In particular, we may lose the services of key employees of the acquired company and we may make changes in management that impair the acquired company\u2019s relationships with employees, vendors and customers. Additionally, we may acquire development-stage companies that are not yet profitable and which require continued investment, which could decrease our future earnings.\nAny of these outcomes could prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of an acquisition. To pay for an acquisition, we might use stock or cash. Alternatively, we might borrow money from a bank or other lender. If we use stock, our stockholders would experience dilution of their ownership interests. If we use cash or debt financing, our financial liquidity would be reduced.\nIf we include future milestones as part of the potential purchase price of an acquisition, as we did in connection with our acquisition of ECP in July 2014, then we will have to estimate the value of these milestones each reporting period and any changes underlying these estimates with respect to expected timing or valuation of these milestones could have a volatile impact on our earnings.\nRevisions to accounting standards and financial reporting and corporate governance requirements could result in changes to our standard practices and could require a significant expenditure of time, attention and resources, especially by senior management.\nWe must follow accounting standards and financial reporting and corporate governance requirements and tax laws set by the governing bodies and lawmakers in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions where we do business, as well as NASDAQ. From time to time, these governing bodies and lawmakers implement new and revised rules and laws. These new and revised accounting standards and financial reporting and corporate governance requirements may require changes to our financial statements, the composition of our\nBoard of Directors, the responsibility and manner of operation of various board level committees and the information filed by us with the governing bodies. Our accounting practices that may be affected by changes in the accounting principles are as follows:\n\u00b7\naccounting for revenue recognition;\n\u00b7\naccounting for intangibles-goodwill and other;\n\u00b7\nfair value measurement;\n\u00b7\naccounting for income taxes;\n\u00b7\naccounting for stock-based compensation;\n\u00b7\naccounting for leases; and\n\u00b7\naccounting for business combinations.\nImplementing changes required by new standards, requirements or laws likely will require a significant expenditure of time, attention and resources. It is impossible to completely predict the impact, if any, on us of future changes to accounting standards and financial reporting and corporate governance requirements.\nWe use estimates, make judgments and apply certain methods in measuring the progress of our business in determining our financial results and in applying our accounting policies. As these estimates, judgments and methods change, our assessment of the progress of our business and our results of operations could vary.\nThe methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations. Such methods, estimates and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, complexities, uncertainties and assumptions, and factors may arise over time that may lead us to change our methods, estimates and judgments. Changes in any of our assumptions may cause variation in our financial reporting and may adversely affect our reported financial results.\nEnvironmental and health safety laws may result in liabilities, expenses and restrictions on our operations.\nFederal, state, local and foreign laws regarding environmental protection, hazardous substances and human health and safety may adversely affect our business. Using hazardous substances in our operations exposes us to the risk of accidental injury, contamination or other liability from the use, storage, importation, handling, or disposal of hazardous materials. If our or our suppliers\u2019 operations result in the contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and fines, and any liability could significantly exceed our insurance coverage and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We maintain insurance for certain environmental risks, subject to substantial deductibles; however, we cannot assure you we can continue to maintain this insurance in the future at an acceptable cost or at all. Future changes to environmental and health and safety laws could cause us to incur additional expenses or restrict our operations.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported sales and results of operations.\nBecause some of our international sales are denominated in local currencies and not in U.S. dollars, our reported sales and earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Euro. At present, we do not hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. As a result, sales and expenses occurring in the future that are denominated in foreign currencies may be translated into U.S. dollars at less favorable rates, resulting in reduced revenues and earnings.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely and may continue to do so. For example, from April 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016, the price of our stock ranged from a low of $59.04 per share to a high of $110.68 per share. Many factors could cause the market price of our common stock to rise and fall. Some of these factors are:\n\u00b7\nvariations in our quarterly results of operations;\n\u00b7\nstatus of regulatory approvals for our products;\n\u00b7\nintroduction of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nacquisitions or strategic alliances involving us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in healthcare policy or third-party reimbursement practices;\n\u00b7\nchanges in estimates of our performance or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nthe hiring or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nresults of clinical trials of our products;\n\u00b7\nnotice of a recall or other safety issue that impacts the ability for customers to use our products;\n\u00b7\nfuture sales of shares of common stock in the public market;\n\u00b7\nthe outcome of currently pending litigation and governmental investigations; and\n\u00b7\nmarket conditions in the industry, particularly around reimbursement for our products and the economy as a whole.\nIn addition, the stock market in general and the market for shares of medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years. These fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. When the market price of a company\u2019s stock drops significantly, stockholders often institute securities class action litigation against that company. Any litigation against us could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert the time and attention of our management and other resources, or otherwise harm our business.\nThe sale of additional shares of our common stock, or the exercise of outstanding options to purchase our common stock, would dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership interest.\nWe have issued a substantial number of restricted stock units and options to acquire our common stock and we expect to continue to issue restricted stock units and stock options to our employees and others. If all outstanding stock options were exercised and all outstanding restricted stock units vested, our stockholders would suffer dilution of their ownership interest. In addition, we have issued from time to time, additional shares of our common stock in connection with acquisitions, public offerings, and other activities. Future issuances of our common stock would also result in a dilution of our stockholders\u2019 ownership interest.\nThe sale of material amounts of common stock could encourage short sales by third parties and depress the price of our common stock. As a result, our stockholders may lose all or part of their investment.\nThe downward pressure on our stock price caused by the sale of a significant number of shares of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur by any of our significant stockholders could cause our stock price to decline, thus allowing short sellers of our stock an opportunity to take advantage of any decrease in the value of our stock. The presence of short sellers in our common stock may further depress the price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us and may prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium on our stock.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and Delaware General Corporation Law may make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if doing so would allow our stockholders to receive a premium over the prevailing market price of our stock. Those provisions of our certificate of incorporation and Delaware law are intended to encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with us and allow our Board of Directors the opportunity to consider alternative proposals in the interest of maximizing stockholder value. However, such provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control which could negatively affect our stock price.\nThe market value of our common stock could vary significantly based on market perceptions of the status of our development efforts.\nThe perception of securities analysts regarding our product development efforts could significantly affect our stock price. As a result, the market price of our common stock has and could in the future change substantially when we or our competitors make product announcements. Many factors affecting our stock price are industry related and beyond our control.\nWe have not paid and do not expect to pay dividends and any return on our stockholders\u2019 investment will likely be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on our earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on our stockholders\u2019 investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.", "PERMNO": 75107, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "ABMD"}
