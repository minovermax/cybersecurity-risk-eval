RISK FACTORS\nThis report, including Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements that may be materially affected by several risk factors, including those summarized below:\nRisks Relating to Our Company\nOur results of operations, cash flows and the value of our properties are highly dependent on the market prices of gold and silver and certain base metals and these prices can be volatile. The profitability of our gold and silver mining operations and the value of our mining properties are directly related to the market price of gold and silver, copper, lead and zinc. The price of gold and silver may also have a significant influence on the market price of our common stock. The market price of gold and silver historically has fluctuated significantly and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include supply and demand fundamentals, global or national political or economic conditions, expectations with respect to the rate of inflation, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar and other currencies, interest rates, gold and silver sales and loans by central banks, forward sales by metal producers, accumulation and divestiture by exchange traded funds, and a number of other factors.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from the sale of gold and silver and our results of operations will fluctuate as the prices of these metals change. A period of significant and sustained lower gold and silver prices would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. The volatility of mineral prices represents a substantial risk which no amount of planning or technical expertise can fully eliminate. In the event mineral prices decline or remain low for prolonged periods of time, we might be unable to develop our existing exploration properties, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial performance, and cash flows. An asset impairment charge may result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse events that impact our estimates of expected cash flows generated from our producing properties or the market value of our non-producing properties, including a material diminution in the price of gold and/or silver.\nDuring 2018, the price of gold, as measured by the London P.M. fix, fluctuated from a low of $1,178 per ounce to a high of $1,355 per ounce while the price of silver fluctuated from a low of $13.97 per ounce to a high of $17.52 per ounce. As of February 25, 2019, gold and silver prices were $1,331 per ounce and $15.96 per ounce, respectively. The volatility in gold and silver prices is illustrated by the following table, which sets forth for each of the past five calendar years, the high, low, and average annual market prices in U.S. dollars per ounce of gold and silver based on the daily London P.M. fix:\nMost of our production is currently limited to a single mine and any interruptions or stoppages in our mining activities would adversely affect our revenue. We are almost entirely dependent on revenues from a single mine to fund our operations. Any interruption in our ability to mine this location, such as a labor strike, natural disaster, or loss of permits would negatively impact our ability to generate revenue following such interruption. Additionally, if we are unable to economically develop additional mines, we will eventually deplete the body of mineralized material and will\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nno longer generate revenue sufficient to fund our operations. A decrease in, or cessation of, our mining operations at this mine would adversely affect our financial performance and may eventually cause us to cease operations.\nIf we are unable to achieve anticipated gold and silver production levels, our financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected. We have proceeded with the processing of ore from the Arista and Mirador underground mines at the Aguila and Alta Gracia projects, respectively, based on estimates of mineralized material identified during exploration and in our Proven and Probable Reserve report. However, risks related to reserve estimates, metallurgy, and/or mining dilution are inherent when working with extractable minerals. Sales of gold and silver that we realize from future mining activity will be less than anticipated if the mined material does not contain the concentration of gold and silver predicted by our geological exploration, studies and reports. If sales of gold and silver are less than anticipated, we may not be able to recover our investment in our properties and our operations may be adversely affected. Our inability to realize production based on quarterly or annual projections may also adversely affect the price of our common stock and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nEstimates of proven and probable reserves and mineralized material are uncertain and the volume and grade of ore actually recovered may vary from our estimates. The proven and probable reserves stated in this report represent the amount of gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc that we estimated, at December 31, 2018, could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Estimates of proven and probable reserves and mineralized material are subject to considerable uncertainty. Such estimates are, to a large extent, based on the prices of gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc as well as interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques. These prices and interpretations are subject to change. If we determine that certain of our estimated reserves or mineralized material have become uneconomic, we may be forced to reduce our estimates. Actual production may be significantly less than we expect.\nAny material changes in mineral estimates and grades of mineralization may affect the economic viability of our current operations, our decision to place a new property into production and/or such property\u2019s return on capital. There can be no assurance that mineral recoveries in small scale laboratory tests will be duplicated in a large-scale on-site operation in a production environment. Extended declines in market prices for gold and/or silver may render portions of our mineralization estimates uneconomic and result in reduced reported mineralization or adversely affect the commercial viability of one or more of our properties. Any material reductions in estimates of mineralization, or of our ability to extract this mineralization, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nAdditionally, the term \u201cmineralized material\u201d as used in this report does not indicate proven and probable reserves as defined by Industry Guide 7 (\u201cGuide 7\u201d) promulgated by the SEC or our standards. Estimates of mineralized material are subject to further exploration and development and are therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. We cannot be certain that any part or parts of the mineralized material deposit will ever be confirmed or converted into Guide 7 compliant reserves or that mineralized material can be economically or legally extracted.\nOur current property portfolio is limited to two producing properties and our ability to remain profitable over the long-term will depend on our ability to expand the known deposits like Arista and Mirador, and /or identify, explore and develop additional properties in Mexico and Nevada. Gold and silver producers must continually replace reserves depleted by production to maintain production levels over the long term and provide a return on invested capital. Depleted reserves can be replaced in several ways, including expanding known ore bodies, locating new deposits, or acquiring interests in reserves from third parties. Exploration is highly speculative in nature, capital intensive, involves many risks and is frequently unproductive. Our current or future exploration programs may not result in new mineral producing operations. Even if significant mineralization is discovered, it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change.\nFrom time to time, we may acquire mineral interests from other parties. Such acquisitions are based on an analysis of a variety of factors including historical exploration results, estimates of and assumptions regarding the extent of\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nmineralized material, and/or reserves, the timing of production from such reserves and cash and other operating costs. In addition, we may rely on data and reports prepared by third parties (including the ability to permit and compliance with existing regulations) which may contain information or data that we are unable to independently verify or confirm. All of these factors are uncertain and may have an impact on our ability to develop the properties.\nAs a result of these uncertainties, our exploration programs and any acquisitions which we may pursue may not result in the expansion or replacement of our current production with new ore reserves or operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position.\nWe may not continue to be profitable. During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we reported net income of $9.3 million, $4.2 million, and $4.4 million, respectively. We have accumulated retained earnings of $12.7 million as of December 31, 2018. Metal prices have a significant impact on our profit margin and there is no assurance that we will be profitable in the future. Unexpected interruptions in our mining business may cause us to incur losses, or the revenue that we generate from production may not be sufficient to fund continuing operations including exploration and mine construction costs. Our failure to generate future profits may adversely affect the price of our common stock and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nWe may require significant additional capital to fund our business plans. We may be required to expend significant funds to determine if mineralized material and proven and probable mineral reserves exist at any of our non-producing properties, to continue exploration, and if warranted, develop our existing properties and to identify and acquire additional properties to diversify our property portfolio. If we receive the necessary permits and make a positive development decision, we will require significant additional capital to bring the project into production. We have spent, and may be required to continue to expend, significant amounts of capital for drilling, geological and geochemical analysis, assaying, feasibility studies, mine development, and mining and process equipment in connection with our exploration, development, and production activities.\nOur ability to obtain necessary funding for these purposes, in turn, depends upon a number of factors, including our historical and prospective results of operations, the status of the national and worldwide economy, the price of gold, silver and other valuable metals, the condition of the debt and equity markets, and the costs associated with extracting minerals. We may not be successful in generating or obtaining the required financing, or if we can obtain such financing, such financing may not be on terms that are favorable to us. Failure to obtain such additional financing could result in delay or indefinite postponement of further mining operations or exploration and construction and the possible partial or total loss of our interest in our properties.\nIf we do not hedge our exposure to fluctuations in gold and silver prices, we may be subject to significant reductions in price. We do not use hedging transactions with respect to any of our gold and silver production and we do not expect to do so in the future. Accordingly, we are fully exposed to price fluctuations if precious and base metal prices decline. While the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines, their use also may limit future revenues from price increases. Hedging transactions also involve the risk that the counterparty may be unable to satisfy its obligations.\nRevenue from the sale of metal concentrate may be adversely affected by loss or damage during shipment and storage at our buyer\u2019s facilities. We rely on third-party transportation companies to transport our metal concentrate to the buyer\u2019s facilities for processing and further refining. The terms of our sales contracts with the buyers require us to rely on assay results from samples of our metal concentrate that are obtained at the buyer\u2019s warehouse to determine the final sales value for our metals. Once the metal concentrate leaves our processing facility, we no longer have direct custody and control of these products. Theft, loss, road accidents, improper storage, fire, natural disasters, tampering or other unexpected events while in transit or at the buyer\u2019s location may lead to the loss of all or a portion of our metal concentrate products. Such losses may not be covered by insurance and may lead to a delay or interruption in our revenue and as a result, our operating results may be adversely affected.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nExploration and, if deemed feasible, development of mineral properties is inherently risky and could lead to unproductive properties and/or capital investments. Our long-term success depends on our ability to identify additional mineral deposits on our properties and any other properties that we may acquire and to develop one or more of those properties into commercially viable mining operations. Mineral exploration is highly speculative in nature, involves many risks and is frequently unproductive. These risks include unusual or unexpected geologic formations and the inability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment or labor. The success of gold exploration is determined in part by the following factors:\n\u00b7\nThe identification of potential gold mineralization based on surface and drill analysis;\n\u00b7\nAvailability of government-granted exploration and construction permits;\n\u00b7\nThe quality of our management and our geological and technical expertise; and\n\u00b7\nThe capital available for exploration and development.\nSubstantial expenditures are required to establish proven and probable reserves through detailed drilling and analysis, to develop metallurgical processes to extract metal and to develop the mining and processing facilities and infrastructure at any site chosen for mining. Whether a mineral deposit will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors, which include, without limitation, the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade, metallurgy, rock competency and proximity to infrastructure like power, water and roads; metal prices, which fluctuate widely; and government regulations, including, without limitation, regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and exporting of minerals, environmental protection and local and community support. We may invest significant capital and resources in exploration activities and abandon such investments if we are unable to identify commercially exploitable mineral reserves. The decision to abandon a project may have an adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and our ability to raise future financing.\nWe may acquire additional exploration stage properties and our business may be negatively impacted if reserves are not located on acquired properties. We have in the past and may in the future acquire additional exploration stage properties. There can be no assurance that reserves will be identified on any properties that we acquire. We may experience negative reactions from the financial markets if we successfully complete acquisitions of additional properties and reserves are not located on acquired properties. These factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock or our financial condition or results of operations.\nTo the extent that we seek to expand our operations and increase our reserves through acquisitions, we may experience issues in executing acquisitions or integrating acquired operations. From time to time, we examine opportunities to make selective acquisitions in order to provide increased returns to our shareholders and to expand our operations and reported reserves and, potentially, generate synergies. The success of any acquisition would depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nIdentifying suitable candidates for acquisition and negotiating acceptable terms;\n\u00b7\nObtaining approval from regulatory authorities and potentially our shareholders;\n\u00b7\nImplementing our standards, controls, procedures and policies at the acquired business and addressing any pre-existing liabilities or claims involving the acquired business; and\n\u00b7\nTo the extent the acquired operations are in a country in which we have not operated historically, understanding the regulations and challenges of operating in that new jurisdiction.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to conclude any acquisitions successfully, or that any acquisition will achieve the anticipated synergies or other positive results. Any material problems that we encounter in connection with such an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe rely on contractors to conduct a significant portion of our operations and construction projects. A significant portion of our operations and construction projects are currently conducted in whole or in part by contractors. As a result, our operations are subject to a number of risks, some of which are outside our control, including:\n\u00b7\nThe difficulty and inherent delay in replacing a contractor and its operating equipment in the event that either party terminates the agreement;\n\u00b7\nReduced control and oversight over those aspects of operations which are the responsibility of the contractor;\n\u00b7\nFailure of a contractor to perform under its agreement;\n\u00b7\nInterruption of operations and construction or increased costs in the event that a contractor ceases its business due to insolvency or other unforeseen events;\n\u00b7\nInjuries or fatalities on the job as a result of the failure to implement or follow adequate safety measures;\n\u00b7\nFailure of a contractor to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, to the extent it is responsible for such compliance; and\n\u00b7\nProblems of a contractor with managing its workforce, labor unrest or other related employment issues.\nIn addition, we may incur liability to third parties as a result of the actions of our contractors. The occurrence of one or more of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nOur profits are subject to two mining duties imposed by the Mexican government. The Mexican government requires mineral producers to pay a \u2018special\u2019 mining duty to the government of 7.5% on net profits and an additional \u2018extraordinary\u2019 mining duty of 0.5% on gross sales of precious metals of gold, silver and platinum. This legislation has and may in the future significantly and adversely affect our results of operations, including our cash flows, which may in turn affect the amount of capital we have available for typical uses of cash, including but not limited to, reinvestment into our business, funding new projects and paying dividends to our shareholders.\nThe facilities and development of our underground and open pit mines and operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in development, construction, and operations. These risks include potential delays, cost overruns, shortages of material or labor, construction defects, breakdowns and injuries to persons and property. We expect to engage subcontractors and material suppliers in connection with the continued mine activities at the Aguila, Alta Gracia, and Isabella Pearl projects. While we anticipate taking all measures which we deem reasonable and prudent in connection with our facilities, construction of the underground mine and the operation of the processing facility, there is no assurance that the risks described above will not cause delays or cost overruns in connection with such construction or operation. Any delays would postpone our anticipated generation of revenue and adversely affect our operations, which in turn may adversely affect the price of our stock.\nUnderground mining operations are subject to unique risks. The exploration for minerals, mine construction and mining operations in an underground mine involve a high level of risk and are often affected by hazards outside of our control. Some of these risks include, but are not limited to, underground fires or floods, fall-of-ground accidents, seismic activity and unexpected geological formations or conditions including noxious fumes or gases. The occurrence of one or more of these events in connection with our exploration, mine construction, or production activities may result in the death of, or personal injury to, our employees, other personnel or third parties, the loss of mining equipment, damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities, monetary losses, deferral or unanticipated fluctuations in production, environmental damage and potential legal liabilities, all of which may adversely affect our reputation, business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nConstruction of mine and process facilities is subject to all of the risks inherent in construction and start-up, including delays and costs of construction in excess of our projections. Many factors could delay or prevent the start or completion of, or increase the costs of, ongoing construction of the mine and process facility, including:\n\u00b7\nDesign, engineering and construction difficulties or delays;\n\u00b7\nCost overruns;\n\u00b7\nOur failure or delay in obtaining necessary legal, regulatory and other approvals;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nInterruptions in the supply of the necessary equipment, or construction materials or labor or an increase in their price;\n\u00b7\nInjuries to persons and property;\n\u00b7\nOpposition of local and or Non-Governmental-Organization interests; and\n\u00b7\nNatural disasters, accidents, political unrest or unforeseen events.\nIf any of the foregoing events were to occur, our financial condition could be adversely affected and we may be required to seek additional capital, which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to complete such construction, we may not be able to recover any costs already incurred. Even if construction of the mine and the processing facilities is completed as scheduled, the costs could exceed our expectations and result in a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to permitting requirements which could result in the delay, suspension or termination of our operations. Our operations, including our ongoing exploration drilling programs and production, require permits from governmental authorities. If we cannot obtain or maintain the necessary permits or if there is a delay in receiving future permits, our timetable and business plan will be adversely affected. We have from time to time relied on third party environmental firms to assist in our efforts to obtain and remain current with required regulations and permits. While we attempt to manage and oversee third party firms, we are dependent on the firm to operate in a professional and knowledgeable manner.\nOur ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on future cash flows and taxable income. We recognize deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized; otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize the deferred tax assets could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws could limit our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2018, our net deferred tax assets were $7.4 million.\nOur continuing reclamation obligations at our operations could require significant additional expenditures. We are responsible for the reclamation obligations related to disturbances located on all of our properties. We have a liability on our balance sheet to cover the estimated reclamation obligation. However, there is a risk that any reserve could be inadequate to cover the actual costs of reclamation when carried out. Continuing reclamation obligations will require a significant amount of capital. There is a risk that we will be unable to fund these additional obligations and further, that the regulatory authorities may increase reclamation requirements to such a degree that it would not be commercially reasonable to continue mining and exploration activities, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial performance and cash flows.\nOur operating properties located in Mexico are subject to changes in political or economic conditions and regulations in that country. The risks with respect to Mexico or other developing countries include, but are not limited to: nationalization of properties, military repression, extreme fluctuations in currency exchange rates, criminal activity, lack of personal safety or ability to safeguard property, labor instability or militancy, mineral title irregularities and high rates of inflation. In addition, changes in mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude in Mexico may adversely affect our business. We may be affected in varying degrees by government regulation with respect to restrictions on production, price controls, export controls, income taxes, expropriation of property, maintenance of claims, environmental legislation, land use, land claims of local people, opposition from non-governmental organizations, water use and mine safety. The effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted and may adversely impact our operations.\nOur ability to develop our Mexican properties is subject to the rights of the Ejido (agrarian cooperatives) who use or own the surface for agricultural purposes. Our ability to mine minerals is subject to maintaining satisfactory\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\narrangements and relationships with the Ejido for access and surface disturbances. Ejidos are groups of local inhabitants who were granted rights to conduct agricultural activities on the property. We must negotiate and maintain a satisfactory arrangement with these residents in order to disturb or discontinue their rights to farm. While we have successfully negotiated and signed such agreements related to the Aguila and Alta Gracia projects, our inability to maintain these agreements or consummate similar agreements for new projects could impair or impede our ability to successfully explore, develop and mine the properties.\nCompetition in the mining industry is intense, and we have limited financial and personnel resources with which to compete. Competition in the mining industry for desirable properties, investment capital and personnel is intense. Numerous companies headquartered in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d), Canada, and elsewhere throughout the world compete for properties and personnel on a global basis. We are a small participant in the gold mining industry due to our limited financial and personnel resources. We presently operate with a limited number of personnel and we anticipate operating in the same manner going forward. We compete with other companies in our industry to hire qualified personnel when needed to successfully operate our mine and processing facility. We may be unable to attract the necessary investment capital or personnel to fully explore and if warranted, develop our properties and be unable to acquire other desirable properties. We believe that competition for acquiring mineral properties, as well as the competition to attract and retain qualified personnel, may continue to be intense in the future.\nSince a significant amount of our expenses in Mexico are paid in Mexican pesos, we are subject to changes in currency values that may adversely affect our results of operations. Our operations have in the past and will in the future be affected by changes in the value of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar. The appreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies such as the peso against the U.S. dollar increases expenses and the cost of purchasing capital assets in U.S. dollar terms in Mexico, which can adversely impact our operating results and cash flows. Conversely, depreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies usually decreases operating costs and capital asset purchases in U.S. dollar terms. The value of cash and cash equivalents, and other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies also fluctuate with changes in currency exchange rates.\nOur activities are subject to significant environmental regulations, which could raise the cost of doing business or adversely affect our ability to develop our properties. Our mining operations in Mexico are subject to environmental regulation by SEMARNAT. Regulations governing advancement of new projects or significant changes to existing projects require an environmental impact statement, known in Mexico as a MIA. We may also be required to submit proof of local community support for a project to obtain final approval. If an environmental impact statement is adverse or if we cannot obtain community support, our ability to explore and develop our properties could be adversely affected. Significant environmental legislation exists in Mexico, including fines and penalties for spills, release of emissions into the air, and other environmental damage, which fines or penalties could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, significant state and federal environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. may hinder our ability to explore, develop, and operate at our Nevada Mining Unit. Federal laws that govern mining claim location and maintenance and mining operations on federal lands are generally administered by the BLM. Additional federal laws, governing mine safety and health, also apply. State laws also require various permits and approvals before exploration, development or production operations can begin. Among other things, a reclamation plan must typically be prepared and approved, with bonding in the amount of projected reclamation costs. The bond is used to ensure that proper reclamation takes place, and the bond will not be released until that time. Local jurisdictions may also impose permitting requirements (such as conditional use permits or zoning approvals).\nOur business is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, a breach or violation of which could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, loss of licenses or permits and reputational harm. We operate in certain jurisdictions that have experienced some degree of governmental and private sector corruption, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with certain local customs and practices. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nbusiness or other commercial advantage. Our Code of Ethics and other corporate policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, which often carry substantial penalties. There can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by our affiliates, employees, contractors, or agents. As such, our corporate policies and processes may not prevent all potential breaches of law or other governance practices. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, litigation, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations or cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems, which are subject to disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration. We are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our operations. Our information technology systems are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into our operations. If we are not able to successfully implement system upgrades or modifications, we may have to rely on manual reporting processes and controls over financial reporting that have not been planned, designed or tested. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to the system upgrades and modifications, but system upgrades and modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could, if not successfully implemented, adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nThe nature of mineral exploration and production activities involves a high degree of risk and the possibility of uninsured losses. Exploration for and the production of minerals is highly speculative and involves greater risk than many other businesses. Many exploration programs do not result in the discovery of mineralization, and any mineralization discovered may not be of sufficient quantity or quality to be profitably mined. Our operations are, and any future mining operations or construction we may conduct will be, subject to all of the operating hazards and risks normally incident to exploring for and mining of mineral properties, such as, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nEconomically insufficient mineralized material;\n\u00b7\nFluctuation in production costs that make mining uneconomic;\n\u00b7\nLabor disputes;\n\u00b7\nUnanticipated variations in grade and other geologic problems;\n\u00b7\nEnvironmental hazards;\n\u00b7\nWater conditions;\n\u00b7\nDifficult surface or underground conditions;\n\u00b7\nIndustrial accidents;\n\u00b7\nMetallurgic and other processing problems;\n\u00b7\nMechanical and equipment performance problems;\n\u00b7\nFailure of pit walls, dams, declines, drifts and shafts;\n\u00b7\nUnusual or unexpected rock formations;\n\u00b7\nPersonal injury, fire, flooding, cave-ins and landslides; and\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nDecrease in the value of mineralized material due to lower gold, silver prices, and other metal prices.\nAny of these risks can materially and adversely affect, among other things, the development of properties, production quantities and rates, costs and expenditures, potential revenues and targeted production dates. We currently have limited insurance to guard against some of these risks. If we determine that capitalized costs associated with any of our mineral interests are not likely to be recovered, we would incur a write down of our investment in these interests. All of these factors may result in losses in relation to amounts spent which are not recoverable or result in additional expenses.\nWe do not insure against all of the risks to which we may be subject in our operations and development. While we currently maintain insurance for general commercial liability claims and the physical assets at our Aguila, Alta Gracia, and Isabella Pearl projects, we do not maintain insurance to cover all of the potential risks associated with our operations. We might be subject to liability for environmental, pollution or other hazards associated with mineral exploration and mine construction, for which insurance may not be available, which may exceed the limits of our insurance coverage, or which we may elect not to insure against because of premium costs or other reasons. We may also not be insured against interruptions to our operations. Losses from these or other events may cause us to incur significant costs which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to fund activities on our properties. A significant loss could force us to reduce or suspend our operations and development.\nWe depend upon a limited number of personnel and the loss of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business. Due to the relatively limited number of personnel that we employ, we are dependent on certain individuals to run our business. These individuals include our executive officers and other key employees. If any of these individuals were to die, become disabled or leave our company, we would be forced to identify and retain individuals to replace them. There is no assurance that we can find suitable individuals to replace them or to add to our employee base if that becomes necessary. We have no life insurance on any individual, and we may be unable to hire a suitable replacement on favorable terms should that become necessary.\nTitle to mineral properties can be uncertain. Our ability to explore and operate our properties depends on the validity of our title to that property. Our U.S. mineral properties include patented and unpatented mining claims. Unpatented mining claims provide only possessory title and their validity is often subject to contest by third parties or the federal government, which makes the validity of unpatented mining claims uncertain and generally riskier. Our concessions in Mexico are subject to continuing government regulation and failure to adhere to such regulations will result in termination of the concession. Uncertainties inherent in mineral properties relate to such things as the sufficiency of mineral discovery, proper posting and marking of boundaries, assessment work and possible conflicts with other claims not determinable from public record. There may be valid challenges to the title to our properties which, if successful, could impair development and/or operations.\nIn the event of a dispute regarding title to our Mexican properties, it will likely be necessary for us to resolve the dispute in Mexico, where we would be faced with unfamiliar laws and procedures. The resolution of disputes in foreign countries can be costly and time consuming. In a foreign country we face the additional burden of understanding unfamiliar laws and procedures. We may not be entitled to a jury trial, as we might be in the United States. Further, to litigate in any foreign country, we would be faced with the necessity of hiring lawyers and other professionals who are familiar with the foreign laws. For these reasons, we may incur unforeseen costs if we are forced to resolve a dispute in Mexico or any other foreign country.\nOur directors and officers may be protected from certain types of lawsuits. The laws of the State of Colorado provide that our directors will not be liable to us or our shareholders for monetary damages for all but certain types of conduct as directors of the company. Our Articles of Incorporation permit us to indemnify our directors and officers against all damages incurred in connection with our business to the fullest extent provided or allowed by law. Additionally, we entered into individual indemnification agreements with our current directors and officers and we intend to execute substantially similar agreements with future directors and officers. The exculpation provisions of any of these items may have the effect of preventing shareholders from recovering damages against our directors caused by\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ntheir negligence, poor judgment or other circumstances. The indemnification provisions may require us to use our limited assets to defend our directors and officers against claims, including claims arising out of their negligence, poor judgment or other circumstances. Pursuant to the terms of the indemnification agreements, we are required to advance funds to our directors and officers prior to the final disposition of any threatened or actual legal proceeding, and including in the event it is ultimately determined that such officer or director is not entitled to indemnification pursuant to the terms of the indemnification agreement, in which case we will depend on reimbursement of advanced expenses from such individual.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile and as a result you could lose part or all of your investment. In addition to other risk factors identified and due to volatility associated with equity securities in general, the value of your investment could decline due to the impact of numerous factors upon the market price of our common stock, including:\n\u00b7\nChanges in the worldwide price for gold and/or silver;\n\u00b7\nAdverse results from our exploration, development, or production efforts;\n\u00b7\nProducing at rates lower than those targeted;\n\u00b7\nPolitical and regulatory risks;\n\u00b7\nWeather conditions, including unusually heavy rains;\n\u00b7\nFailure to meet our revenue or profit goals or operating budget;\n\u00b7\nDecline in demand for our common stock;\n\u00b7\nDownward revisions in securities analysts\u2019 estimates or changes in general market conditions;\n\u00b7\nTechnological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies;\n\u00b7\nInvestor perception of our industry or our prospects;\n\u00b7\nLawsuits;\n\u00b7\nActions by government or central banks; and\n\u00b7\nGeneral economic trends.\nStock markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of individual securities have been highly volatile. These fluctuations are often unrelated to operating performance and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, you may be unable to sell your shares at a desired price.\nPast payments of dividends on our common stock are not a guaranty of future payments of dividends. In 2010, we began paying cash dividends to the holders of our common stock. However, our ability to continue to pay dividends in the future will depend on a number of factors, including, cash flow, mine construction requirements and strategies, other acquisition and/or construction projects, spot gold and silver prices, taxation, government-imposed royalties and general market conditions. Further, a portion of our cash flow is expected to be retained to finance our operations and development of mineral properties. Any material change in our operations may affect future dividends which may be modified or canceled at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Any decrease in our monthly dividend would likely have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to the Continued Listing Criteria of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE American\u201d), and our failure to satisfy these criteria may result in delisting of our common stock. Our common stock is currently listed on the NYSE American. In order to maintain that listing, we must maintain certain share price and other criteria, including maintaining a minimum amount of shareholders\u2019 equity and a minimum number of public shareholders. In addition to objective standards, the NYSE American may delist the securities of any issuer if, in its opinion, the issuer\u2019s financial condition and/or operating results appear unsatisfactory; if it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing on the NYSE American inadvisable; if the issuer sells or disposes of principal operating assets or ceases to be an operating company; if an issuer fails to comply with the NYSE American\u2019s listing requirements; if an issuer\u2019s common stock sells at what the NYSE American considers a \u201clow selling price\u201d and the issuer fails to correct this via a reverse split of shares after notification\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nby the NYSE American; or if any other event occurs or any condition exists which makes continued listing on the NYSE American, in its opinion, inadvisable.\nIf the NYSE American delists our common stock, investors may face material adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, a lack of trading market for our securities, reduced liquidity, decreased analyst coverage of our securities, and an inability for us to obtain additional financing to fund our operations.\nIssuances of our stock in the future could dilute existing shareholders and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We have the authority to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock, 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, and to issue options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock without stockholder approval. As of February 25, 2019, there were 61,402,365 shares of common stock outstanding. Future issuances of our securities could be at prices substantially below the price paid for our common stock by our current shareholders. In addition, we can issue blocks of our common stock in amounts up to 20% of the then-outstanding shares without further shareholder approval. Because we have issued less of our common stock than many of our larger peers, the issuance of a significant amount of our common stock may have a disproportionately large impact on our share price compared to larger companies.\nOur awards of our shares and stock options to employees may not have their intended effect. A portion of our total compensation program for our executive officers and key personnel has historically included the award of shares and options to buy shares of our common stock. If the price of our common stock performs poorly, such performance may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract critical personnel. In addition, any changes made to our stock option policies or to any other of our compensation practices which are made necessary by governmental regulations or competitive pressures could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel.", "PERMNO": 12049, "SIC": 1040, "TIC": "GORO"}
