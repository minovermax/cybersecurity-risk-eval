{"cik": "1440024", "company": "Roadrunner Transportation Systems, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In such a case, you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOne or more significant claims or the cost of maintaining our insurance could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe employ approximately 1,000 drivers and use the services of thousands of ICs and transportation companies and their drivers in connection with our transportation operations. From time to time, these drivers are involved in accidents which may\ncause injuries and in which goods carried by these drivers are lost or damaged. Such accidents usually result in equipment damage and, unfortunately, can also result in injuries or death. Our involvement in the transportation of certain goods, including but not limited to hazardous materials, could also increase our exposure in the event of an accident resulting in injuries or contamination. The resulting types and/or amounts of damages may under any of these circumstances be excluded by or exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or the insurance coverage maintained by the contracted carrier. Although most of these drivers are ICs or work for third-party carriers, from time to time claims may be asserted against us for their actions or for our actions in retaining them. Claims against us may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage, or may not be covered by insurance at all. A material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, claims for lost or damaged goods, liability claims, workers' compensation claims, or unfavorable resolutions of any such claims could adversely affect our results of operations to the extent claims are not covered by our insurance or such losses exceed our reserves. Significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could also reduce our profitability and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. The timing of the incurrence of these costs could also significantly and adversely impact our operating results compared to prior periods.\nIncreased insurance premium costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nInsurance carriers may increase premiums for transportation companies generally. We could also experience additional increases in our insurance premiums in the future if our claims experience worsens. If our insurance or claims expense increases and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, we may not be able to maintain or obtain sufficient or desired levels of insurance at reasonable rates. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nThe cost of compliance with, liability for violations of, or modifications to existing or future governmental regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur operations are regulated and licensed by various federal and state transportation agencies in the United States and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate. These regulatory agencies have authority and oversight of domestic and international transportation services and related activities, licensure, motor carrier operations, safety and security, and other matters. We must comply with various insurance and surety bond requirements to act in the capacities for which we are licensed. Our subsidiaries and ICs must also comply with applicable regulations and requirements of such agencies.\nThrough our subsidiaries, we hold various licenses required to carry out our domestic and international services. These licenses permit us to provide services as a motor carrier, property broker, air carrier, indirect air carrier, ocean transportation intermediary, non-vessel operating common carrier, freight forwarder, and ocean freight forwarder. We also are subject to regulations and requirements promulgated by, among others, the DOT, FMCSA, DHS, CBP, TSA, FMC, IATA, and various other international, domestic, state, and local agencies and port authorities. Our failure to maintain our required licenses, or to comply with applicable regulations, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. See the section entitled \"Regulation\" in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nIn addition, DHS regulations applicable to our customers who import goods into the United States and our contracted ocean carriers may impact our ability to provide and/or receive services with and from these parties. Enforcement measures related to violations of these regulations can slow and/or prevent the delivery of shipments, which may negatively impact our operations.\nWe incur significant costs to operate our business and monitor our compliance with these laws and regulations. The regulatory requirements governing our operations are subject to change based on new legislation and regulatory initiatives, which could affect the economics of the transportation industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for, and the cost of providing, transportation services. We cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business. Compliance with existing, new, or more stringent measures could disrupt or impede the timing of our deliveries and our ability to satisfy the needs of our customers. In addition, we may experience an increase in operating costs, such as security costs, as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities. The cost of compliance with existing or future measures could adversely affect our results of operations. Further, we could become subject to liabilities as a result of a failure to comply with applicable regulations.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties.\nFrom time to time, we arrange for the movement of hazardous materials at the request of our customers. As a result, we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the handling, transport, and disposal of hazardous materials. If our customers or carriers are involved in an accident involving hazardous materials, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties, remediation costs, or civil and criminal liability, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, current and future laws and regulations relating to carbon emissions and the effects of global warming can be expected to have a significant impact on the transportation\nsector generally and the operations and profitability of some of our carriers in particular, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA decrease in levels of capacity in the over-the-road freight sector could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe current operating environment in the over-the-road freight sector resulting from fluctuating fuel costs, industry-specific regulations (such as the CSA and hours-of-service rules and the proposed but not yet finalized changes implemented under Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century (MAP-21)), a shortage of qualified drivers, and other economic factors are causing a tightening of capacity in the sector generally, and in our carrier network specifically, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to execute our business strategy and on our business.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy, and any acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe plan to increase our revenue and expand our service offerings in the market regions that we serve through the acquisition of complementary businesses. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions or investment candidates. Even if we identify suitable candidates, we cannot guarantee that we will make acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, we may incur debt or be required to issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or investments. The issuance of any equity securities could be dilutive to our stockholders.\nStrategic acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nfailure of the acquired company to achieve anticipated revenues, earnings, or cash flows;\n\u2022\nassumption of liabilities that were not disclosed to us or that exceed our estimates;\n\u2022\nproblems integrating the purchased operations with our own, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical, or financial problems;\n\u2022\npotential compliance issues with regard to acquired companies that did not have adequate internal controls;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention or other resources from our existing business;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with entering markets in which we have limited prior experience; and\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired company.\nWe may have difficulties integrating acquired companies.\nFor acquisitions, success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations. These risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time. We are required to integrate these businesses into our internal control environment, which may present challenges that are different than those presented by organic growth and that may be difficult to manage. The possible difficulties of integration include, among others: retention of customers and key employees; unanticipated issues in the assimilation and consolidation of information, communications, and other systems; inefficiencies and difficulties that arise because of unfamiliarity with potentially new geographic areas and new assets and the businesses associated with them; consolidation of corporate and administrative infrastructures; the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns; the effect on internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and unanticipated issues, expenses, and liabilities. The diversion of the attention of management from our current operations to the acquired operations and any difficulties encountered in combining operations could prevent us from realizing the full benefits anticipated to result from the acquisitions and could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Also, following an acquisition, we may discover previously unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business for which we have no recourse under applicable indemnification provisions. If we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not successfully manage our growth.\nWe intend to continue to grow rapidly and substantially, including by expanding our internal resources, making acquisitions, and entering into new markets. We may experience difficulties and higher-than-expected expenses in executing this strategy as a result of unfamiliarity with new markets, change in revenue and business models, and entering into new geographic areas.\nOur growth will place a significant strain on our management and our operational and financial resources. We will need to continually improve existing procedures and controls as well as implement new transaction processing, operational and financial systems, and procedures and controls to expand, train, and manage our employee base. Our working capital needs will increase\nsubstantially as our operations grow. Failure to manage growth effectively, or obtain necessary working capital, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nOur international operations subject us to operational and financial risks.\nWe provide transportation and logistics services to and from international locations and are, therefore, subject to risks of international business, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in tariffs, trade restrictions, trade agreements, and taxations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing or overseeing foreign operations and agents;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the repatriation of funds because of foreign exchange controls;\n\u2022\ndifferent liability standards; and\n\u2022\nintellectual property laws of countries which do not protect our rights in our intellectual property, including, but not limited to, our proprietary information systems, to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nWe are also subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d). Failure to comply with the FCPA and local regulations in the conduct of our international business operations may result in legal claims against us.\nThe occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region and/or decrease the profitability of our operations in that region.\nAs we expand our business in foreign countries, we will be exposed to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles. We have limited control over these risks, and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions, we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to expand our business or respond to changes, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had indebtedness of $430.0 million. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including any additional borrowings available under our senior credit facility. Any substantial indebtedness and the fact that a substantial portion of our cash flow from operating activities could be needed to make payments on this indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nreducing the availability of our cash flow for our operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities, and other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate, which would place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have less debt;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.\nOur ability to borrow any funds needed to operate and expand our business will depend in part on our ability to generate cash. Our ability to generate cash is subject to the performance of our business as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities or if future borrowings are not available to us under our senior credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, our operating results, financial condition, and ability to expand our business may be adversely affected. Moreover, our inability to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations in the future would require us to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, sell assets, delay capital expenditures, or seek additional equity.\nAdditionally, we have exposure to changes in interest rates on our revolving credit facility and term loan. The interest rates on our revolving credit facility and term loan fluctuate based on the prime rate or LIBOR plus an applicable margin. Assuming our $350.0 million revolving credit facility was fully drawn and taking into consideration the outstanding term loan of $195.0 million as of December 31, 2014, a 1.0% increase in the borrowing rate would increase our annual interest expense by $5.5 million.\nOur senior credit facility contains financial and other restrictive covenants with which we may be unable to comply. A default under these financing arrangements could cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe loans outstanding under our senior credit facility are secured by a first priority lien on certain real property owned by our domestic subsidiaries and substantially all of our and our domestic subsidiaries' tangible and intangible personal property, including a pledge of the capital stock of certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Our senior credit facility contains conditions, representations and warranties, events of default, and indemnification provisions that are customary for financings of this type including, but not limited to, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum adjusted leverage ratio, and limitations on incurrence of debt, investments, liens on assets, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, and purchases and sales of assets.\nIf we default under the terms of this facility and fail to obtain appropriate amendments to or waivers under the applicable financing arrangement, our borrowings against the facility could be immediately declared due and payable. If we fail to pay the amount due, the lenders could proceed against the collateral by which our loans are secured, our borrowing capacity may be limited, or the facility could be terminated. If acceleration of outstanding borrowings occurs or if the facilities are terminated, we may have difficulty borrowing additional funds sufficient to refinance the accelerated debt or entering into new credit or debt arrangements, and, if available, the terms of the financing may not be acceptable. A default under our senior credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nFluctuations in the price or availability of fuel and limitations on our ability to collect fuel surcharges may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with fuel charges from our ICs, purchased power providers, and aircraft in our LTL and TL businesses. The availability and price of fuel are subject to political, economic, and market factors that are outside of our control. Fuel prices have fluctuated dramatically over recent years. Over time we have been able to mitigate the impact of the fluctuations through our fuel surcharges which are closely linked to the market price for fuel. There can be no assurance that our fuel surcharge revenue programs will be effective in the future. Market pressures may limit our ability to assess our fuel surcharges. At the request of our customers, we have at times temporarily capped the fuel surcharges at a fixed percentage pursuant to contractual arrangements that vary by customer. Currently, a minimal number of our customers have contractual arrangements with varying levels of capped fuel surcharges. If fuel surcharge revenue programs, base freight rate increases, or other cost-recovery mechanisms do not offset our exposure to rising fuel costs, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nA significant or prolonged economic downturn in the over-the-road freight sector, or a substantial downturn in our customers' business, could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nThe over-the-road freight sector has historically experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to, among other things, economic recession, downturns in business cycles, increasing costs and taxes, fluctuations in energy prices, price increases by carriers, changes in regulatory standards, license and registration fees, interest rate fluctuations, and other economic factors beyond our control. All of these factors could increase the operating costs of a vehicle and impact capacity levels in the over-the-road freight sector. Our ICs or purchased power providers may charge higher prices to cover higher operating expenses, and our operating income may decrease if we are unable to pass through to our customers the full amount of higher purchased transportation costs. Additionally, economic conditions may adversely affect our customers, their need for our services, or their ability to pay for our services.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and, if we are unable to adequately address factors that may adversely affect our revenue and costs, our business could suffer.\nCompetition in the transportation services industry is intense. We face significant competition in local, regional, national, and international markets. Increased competition may lead to revenue reductions, reduced profit margins, or a loss of market share, any one of which could harm our business. There are many factors that could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability, including the following:\n\u2022\ncompetition with other transportation services companies, some of which have a broader coverage network, a wider range of services, and greater capital resources than we do;\n\u2022\nreduction by our competitors of their freight rates to gain business, especially during times of declining growth rates in the economy, which reductions may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates, maintain our operating margins, or maintain significant growth in our business;\n\u2022\nsolicitation by shippers of bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs and the resulting depression of freight rates or loss of business to competitors;\n\u2022\ndevelopment of a technology system similar to ours by a competitor with sufficient financial resources and comparable experience in the transportation services industry; and\n\u2022\nestablishment by our competitors of cooperative relationships to increase their ability to address shipper needs.\nOur executive officers and key personnel are important to our business, and these officers and personnel may not remain with us in the future.\nWe depend substantially on the efforts and abilities of our senior management. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to retain our current management team and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. Competition for senior management is intense, and we may not be able to retain our management team or attract additional qualified personnel. The loss of a member of senior management would require our remaining executive officers to divert immediate and substantial attention to fulfilling the duties of the departing executive and to seeking a replacement. The inability to adequately fill vacancies in our senior executive positions on a timely basis could negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur reliance on ICs to provide transportation services to our customers could limit our expansion.\nOur transportation services are conducted in part by ICs, who are generally responsible for paying for their own equipment, fuel, and other operating costs. Our ICs are responsible for providing the tractors and generally the trailers they use related to our business. Certain factors such as increases in fuel costs, insurance costs and the cost of new and used tractors, reduced financing sources available to ICs for the purchase of equipment, or the impact of CSA and hours-of-service rules could create a difficult operating environment for ICs. Turnover and bankruptcy among ICs in the over-the-road freight sector often limit the pool of qualified ICs and increase the competition among carriers for their services. If we are required to increase the amounts paid to ICs in order to obtain their services, our results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent increased expenses are not offset by higher freight rates. Additionally, our agreements with our ICs are terminable by either party upon short notice and without penalty. Consequently, we regularly need to recruit qualified ICs to replace those who have left our pool. If we are unable to retain our existing ICs or recruit new ICs, our results of operations and ability to expand our business could be adversely affected.\nOur third-party carriers must meet our needs and expectations, and those of our customers, and their inability to do so could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business depends to a large extent on our ability to provide consistent, high quality, technology-enabled transportation and logistics solutions. We generally do not own or control the transportation assets that deliver our customers' freight, and we generally do not employ the people directly involved in delivering the freight. We rely on third parties to provide less-than-truckload, truckload and intermodal brokerage, and domestic and international air services and to report certain information to us, including information relating to delivery status and freight claims. This reliance could cause delays in providing our customers with timely delivery of freight and important service data, as well as in the financial reporting of certain events, including recognizing revenue and recording claims. If we are unable to secure sufficient transportation services to meet our customer commitments, or if any of the third parties we rely on do not meet our needs or expectations, or those of our customers, our results of operations could be adversely affected, and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently.\nIf our ICs are deemed by regulators to be employees, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nTax and other regulatory authorities have in the past sought to assert that ICs in the trucking industry are employees rather than ICs. There can be no assurance that these authorities will not successfully assert this position against us or that tax and other laws that currently consider these persons ICs will not change. If our ICs are determined to be our employees, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers' compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment, and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits, tax withholdings, and penalties and interest. Our business model relies on the fact that our ICs are ICs and not deemed to be our employees, and exposure to any of the above factors could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur financial results may be adversely impacted by potential future changes in accounting practices.\nFuture changes in accounting standards or practices, and related legal and regulatory interpretations of those changes, may adversely impact public companies in general, the transportation industry, or our operations specifically. New accounting standards or requirements, such as a conversion from GAAP to International Financial Reporting Standards, could change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets, and/or liabilities or could be costly to implement. These types of regulations could have a negative impact on our financial position, liquidity, results of operations, and/or access to capital.\nWe rely heavily on information and technology to operate our transportation and business networks, and any disruption to our technology infrastructure or the Internet could harm our operations and our reputation among customers.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers and to compete effectively depends in part upon the sophistication and reliability of our technology network, including our ability to provide features of service that are important to our customers. To keep pace with changing technologies and customer demands in the future, we must correctly interpret and address market trends and enhance the features and functionality of our technology system. We may be unable to implement the appropriate features and functionality in a timely manner, which could result in decreased demand for our services and a corresponding decrease in revenue.\nIn addition, we have become increasingly reliant on our technology systems for our operations as well as providing services to our customers. External and internal risks, such as malware, code anomalies, \u201cActs of God,\u201d attempts to penetrate our networks, transitional challenges in migrating operating company functionality to a centralized automation platform, data leakage, and human error pose a direct threat to our services and data. Any disruption to the Internet or our complex technology infrastructure, including those impacting our computer systems, could adversely impact our customer service, volumes, and revenues and result in increased costs. These types of adverse impacts could also occur in the event the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of company and customer information was compromised due to a data loss by us or a trusted third party. While we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives, information technology risk management, and disaster recovery plans, these measures cannot fully insulate us from technology disruptions or data loss and the resulting adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Additionally, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data or system protection measures could be significant.\nSeasonal sales fluctuations and weather conditions could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nThe transportation industry is subject to seasonal sales fluctuations as shipments are generally lower during and after the winter holiday season. The productivity of our carriers historically decreases during the winter season because companies have the tendency to reduce their shipments during that time and inclement weather can impede operations. At the same time, our operating expenses could increase because harsh weather can lead to increased accident frequency rates and increased claims. If we were to experience lower-than-expected revenue during any such period, our expenses may not be offset, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nTerrorist attacks, anti-terrorism measures, and war could have broad detrimental effects on our business operations.\nAs a result of the potential for terrorist attacks, federal, state, and municipal authorities have implemented and continue to follow various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. Such measures may reduce the productivity of our ICs or increase the costs associated with their operations, which we could be forced to bear. For example, security measures imposed at bridges, tunnels, border crossings, and other points on key trucking routes may cause delays and increase the non-driving time of our ICs, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. War, risk of war, or a terrorist attack also may have an adverse effect on the economy. A decline in economic activity could adversely affect our revenues or restrict our future growth. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war also could impact our ability to raise capital. In addition, the insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by us could increase dramatically or such coverage could be unavailable in the future.\nOur TL business derives a portion of its revenues from inventory management, the loss of which could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nA portion of our TL business is involved with inventory and freight management for customers whose products are shipped to a limited number of big box retailers. Should these big box retailers change their supply chain practices and direct our customers to deliver product via another source, such change could have a negative impact on our TL business.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from achieving our growth objectives.\nWe may in the future be required to raise capital through public or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business. Additional equity financing may dilute the interests of our stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and could reduce our profitability. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures.\nOur total assets include goodwill and intangibles. If we determine that these items have become impaired in the future, our earnings could be adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had recorded goodwill of $669.7 million and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $79.9 million. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of a business acquired. Goodwill and other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently, if indicators of impairment exist. If the impairment evaluations for goodwill and intangible assets\nindicate the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Our annual impairment evaluations of goodwill are performed as of July 1, and it was determined that there was no impairment of the recorded balances as of July 1, 2014 and 2013.\nIf we are unable to expand the number of our sales representatives, or if a significant number of our existing sales representatives leave us, our ability to increase our revenue could be negatively impacted.\nOur ability to expand our business will depend, in part, on our ability to attract additional sales representatives and brokerage agents. Competition for qualified sales representatives can be intense, and we may be unable to attract such persons. Any difficulties we experience in expanding the number of our sales representatives could have a negative impact on our ability to expand our customer base, increase our revenue, and continue our growth.\nIn addition, we must retain our current sales representatives and properly incentivize them to obtain new customers and maintain existing customer relationships. If a significant number of our sales representatives leave us, our revenue could be negatively impacted. A significant increase in the turnover rate among our current sales representatives could also increase our recruiting costs and decrease our operating efficiency.\nChanges in our relationships with our significant customers, including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them, could have an adverse impact on us.\nNo single customer accounted for more than 4% of our 2014 revenue. We do not believe the loss of any single customer would materially impair our overall financial condition or results of operations; however, collectively, some of these large customers might account for a relatively significant portion of the growth in revenue and margins in a particular quarter or year. Our contractual relationships with customers generally are terminable at will by the customers on short notice and do not require the customer to provide any minimum commitment. Our customers could choose to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors, demand rate reductions for our services, require us to assume greater liability that increases our costs, or develop their own logistics capabilities. Failure to retain our existing customers or enter into relationships with new customers could materially impact the growth in our business and the ability to meet our current and long-term financial forecasts.\nThe market value of our common stock may fluctuate and could be substantially affected by various factors.\nThe price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") constantly changes. We expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate. Our share price may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in earnings, financial or operating performance, or liquidity;\n\u2022\nchanges in analysts' recommendations or projections;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet analysts' projections;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and capital market conditions;\n\u2022\nannouncements of developments related to our business;\n\u2022\noperating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers;\n\u2022\nactions by government regulators;\n\u2022\nnews reports of trends, concerns, and other issues related to us or our industry, including changes in regulations; and\n\u2022\nother factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nOur common stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance. General market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices.\nOur current principal stockholders continue to have significant influence over us, and they could delay, deter, or prevent a change of control or other business combination or otherwise cause us to take action with which you might not agree.\nInvestment funds affiliated with HCI Equity Partners, L.L.C. together owned approximately 25.8% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2014. In addition, two of our directors are affiliated with HCI Equity Partners, L.L.C. As a result, these stockholders will have significant influence over the election of our board of directors and our decision to enter into any corporate transaction and may have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of stockholders, regardless of whether or not other stockholders believe that such a transaction is in their own best interests. Such concentration of voting power could have\nthe effect of delaying, deterring, or preventing a change of control or other business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders or could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests as a company or the interests of our other stockholders. Accordingly, these stockholders could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that you would not approve or make decisions with which you may disagree.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, discourage a takeover, and adversely affect existing stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain provisions that may make it more difficult or delay attempts by others to obtain control of our company, even when these attempts may be in the best interests of our stockholders. These include provisions limiting the stockholders' powers to remove directors or take action by written consent instead of at a stockholders' meeting. Our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to issue one or more series of preferred stock, which could have voting and conversion rights that adversely affect or dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides for our board to be divided into three classes, serving staggered terms. The classified board provision could have the effect of discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. Delaware law also imposes conditions on the voting of \u201ccontrol shares\u201d and on certain business combination transactions with \u201cinterested stockholders.\u201d\nThese provisions and others that could be adopted in the future could deter unsolicited takeovers or delay or prevent changes in our control or management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. These provisions may also limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.", "PERMNO": 93384, "SIC": 4731, "TIC": "RRTS"}
