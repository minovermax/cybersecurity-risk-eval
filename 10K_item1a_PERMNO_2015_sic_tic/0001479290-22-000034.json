RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as all other information included in this Report, including our consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto and the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d before you decide to purchase shares of our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations and stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Strategy\nWe are substantially dependent on the clinical and commercial success of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection.\nTo date, we have invested substantial efforts and financial resources in the research and development of neuromodulator product candidates. Our near-term prospects, including our ability to finance our business and generate revenue, and our future growth is substantially dependent on the clinical and commercial success of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection. In December 2018, we completed Phase 3 clinical development for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines. Although we have successfully completed the Phase 3 clinical development program for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines, our ability to receive FDA approval, and its timing, is uncertain.\nWe submitted the BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines in November 2019, which was accepted by the FDA on February 5, 2020, and the PDUFA target action date was initially set for November 25, 2020. On November 24, 2020, the FDA deferred its decision on the BLA. The FDA reiterated that an inspection of our manufacturing facility is required as part of the BLA approval process, but the FDA was unable to conduct the required inspection due to the FDA\u2019s travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The FDA initiated the pre-approval inspection of our manufacturing facility in June 2021. Following the inspection, the FDA provided us with its observations in a Form 483, and we responded to those observations in July 2021. On October 15, 2021, we received a CRL with respect to the BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines. The FDA determined it was unable to approve the BLA in its present form due to deficiencies related to the onsite inspection at our manufacturing facility. The CRL did not identify any other deficiencies. In December 2021, we held a Type A meeting with the FDA to gain clarity and alignment on the requirements for approval of the BLA. Based on the meeting minutes, received by the Company on January 14, 2022, a complete response to address the outstanding observations related to the WCB and the drug substance manufacturing process will require the Company to qualify its new WCB by producing three consecutive drug substance lots and one drug product lot. We have completed the manufacturing of three consecutive drug substance lots and one drug product lot as part of the qualification of the new WCB and are actively working on completing the resubmission package for the BLA. A reinspection of the Company\u2019s manufacturing facility will be required once the resubmission is accepted by the FDA. We cannot be certain of how long it will take to finalize the resubmission of the BLA, whether we are able to address the outstanding observations of the FDA and remediate the deficiencies related to the manufacturing inspection or how quickly or successfully the regulatory approval process will move following our resubmission of the BLA, including how long it will take the FDA to reinspect the manufacturing facility and the extent to which the reinspection is successful.\nA continuing delay in obtaining FDA approval of the BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines has and would further delay commercialization and would adversely impact our ability to generate revenue and finance our business. A continuing delay in or failure to obtain FDA approval may also directly or indirectly impact the valuation of certain assets, including, but not limited to, potential impairment charges related to the Service Segment. If the BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines is not approved on a timely basis or at all, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely impacted.\nThe successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection will depend on a number of factors, including the risks identified in this \u201c-Risk Factors.\u201d One or more of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could cause significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue through the sale of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection to continue our business.\nWe are substantially dependent on the clinical and commercial success of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers.\nAs of the date of this Report, we have not generated material revenue from the sale of any product except the Current RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers. Our success as a company is substantially dependent on our ability to continue to generate revenue from the sales of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, which will depend on many factors including, but not limited to, our ability to:\n\u2022execute our sales and marketing strategies for the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers;\n\u2022maintain and manage the necessary sales, marketing and other capabilities and infrastructure that are required to continue to successfully commercialize the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers;\n\u2022achieve, maintain and grow market acceptance of, and demand for, the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers;\n\u2022establish or demonstrate in the medical community the safety and efficacy of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and their potential advantages over and side effects compared to existing dermal fillers and products currently in clinical development;\n\u2022offer the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers at competitive prices as compared to alternative options, and our ability to achieve a suitable profit margin on our sales of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers;\n\u2022collaborate with Teoxane to obtain necessary approvals from the FDA and similar regulatory authorities for the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products;\n\u2022adapt to additional changes to the label for the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, that could place restrictions on how we market and sell the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, including as a result of adverse events observed in these or other studies;\n\u2022obtain adequate and timely supply of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, which has in the past and may in the future be adversely affected by factors relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors;\n\u2022comply with the terms of the Teoxane Agreement, including our obligations with respect to purchase quantities and marketing efforts;\n\u2022comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, including medical device compliance as the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers are Class III Premarket Approval (\u201cPMA\u201d) devices under the FDCA;\n\u2022maintain necessary state prescription medical device distribution permits and maintain complaint and medical device vigilance services in support of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers;\n\u2022maintain our arrangements with third party logistics providers to distribute the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers to customers;\n\u2022enforce our intellectual property rights in and to the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers; and\n\u2022avoid third-party patent interference or intellectual property infringement claims.\nIf we do not achieve or maintain one or more of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, in a timely manner or at all, we may not be able to continue to generate revenue from the sales of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and successfully commercialize the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products, which may materially impact the success of our business. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, product supply of the Current RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers was delayed by Teoxane, as they temporarily suspended production in Geneva, Switzerland in early 2020. Teoxane resumed manufacturing operations at the end of April 2020 and delivered the first shipment of the Current RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers to us in June 2020. As a result of production delay, the initial product launch of the Current RHA\u00ae Collection\nof dermal fillers was delayed by one quarter to September 2020. Additional delays in the product supply of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers may have an adverse effect on our commercialization activities.\nIf we fail to comply with the terms of the Teoxane Agreement, including by failing to meet certain obligations in connection with purchase and marketing of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, Teoxane may terminate the Teoxane Agreement, and we would have no further rights to distribute the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers. In addition, the lack of, or limited, complementary products to be offered by sales personnel in marketing the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue through the sale of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers to continue our business.\nWe will require substantial additional financing to continue to operate our business and achieve our goals.\nSince our inception, most of our resources have been dedicated to the research and development of our neuromodulator product candidates. Our clinical programs for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection and an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar will require substantial additional funds to complete. In connection with the Teoxane Agreement, we must make specified annual minimum purchases of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and meet annual minimum expenditures in connection with the commercialization of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers. We have incurred substantial transaction expenses in order to complete the HintMD Acquisition. Further, to grow the Fintech Platform business, we must develop features, products and services that reflect the needs of customers and the changing nature of payments processing software and continually modify and enhance the Fintech Platform to keep pace with changes in updated hardware, software, communications and database technologies and standards and to remain competitive. In addition, we have dedicated manufacturing capacity, buyback obligations, cost sharing arrangements and related minimum purchase obligations under our manufacturing and supply agreements in connection with the manufacture and supply of our product candidates. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise from disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had working capital surplus of $178.8 million and an accumulated deficit of $1.4 billion. Our net losses were $281.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $282.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of common stock, convertible senior notes, payments received from collaboration arrangements, and sales of the Current RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers. As of December 31, 2021, we had capital resources consisting of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $225.1 million.\nOn October 15, 2021, the FDA issued a CRL regarding our BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines. The FDA indicated it was unable to approve the BLA in its present form due to deficiencies related to the FDA\u2019s onsite inspection at our manufacturing facility. As a result, the potential commercial launch of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines has been delayed. The commercial launch delay and its impact on our capital resources has raised substantial doubt with respect to our ability to meet our obligations to continue as a going concern. Our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will not allow us to fund our operations for at least 12 months following the filing of this Report. In order to mitigate the substantial doubt to continue as a going concern, we will be required to raise additional capital to meet our operating obligations and fund our operations. See \u201cPart IV, Item 15. \u201cExhibits and Financial Statement Schedules-Notes to consolidated financial statements-Note 1-The Company \u201d for more information.\nHowever, no assurance can be given that additional capital will be available to us on a timely basis, or at all, or that we will raise enough capital to mitigate the substantial doubt to continue as a going concern. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, or at all, we will be required to take additional actions beyond the cost preservation measures previously initiated to address our liquidity needs, including to continue to further reduce operating expense and delay, reduce the scope of, discontinue or alter our research and development activities for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products and our onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar program; the development of OPUL\u2122; our sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to continue to commercialize the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, OPUL\u2122 and our product candidates, if approved, and other aspects of our business plan.\nIf we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements, royalty financings or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may need to relinquish certain valuable\nrights to our product candidates, technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted and the terms of any new equity securities may have a preference over our common stock. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to specified financial covenants or covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or pursuing certain transactions, any of which could restrict our ability to commercialize our product candidates or operate as a business.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are not profitable and have incurred losses in each year since we commenced operations in 2002. In addition, we have limited experience and have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the biotechnology industry. We have only made sales of the Current RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers since the initial product launch in September 2020 and the Fintech Platform since the HintMD Acquisition in July 2020 and have not demonstrated the ability to successfully commercialize the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers or the Fintech Platform over the long-term. To date, we have not obtained any regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates or generated any revenue from our product sales including with respect to DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection.\nWe expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we continue our development of, seek regulatory approval for and begin to commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, and continue to commercialize the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and OPULTM. Our ability to achieve revenue and profitability is dependent on our ability to complete the development of our product candidates, obtain necessary regulatory approvals, manufacture and market and commercialize our products and services successfully. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital and continue operations.\nThe regulatory approval process is highly uncertain and we or any collaboration partner may not obtain regulatory approval for the commercialization of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products or any future product candidates.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, import, export, marketing and distribution of drug and biologic products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the U.S. and other countries, which regulations differ from country to country. Neither we nor any collaboration partner are permitted to market DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products or any future product candidates in the U.S. until the BLA is approved by the FDA. We are also not permitted to market the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers for additional indications for use unless and until Teoxane receives approval of a PMA supplement for such new indication for use. And, we cannot market our product candidates in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from the regulatory authorities of such countries. Obtaining regulatory approval can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process and delay or failure can occur at any stage of any of our clinical trials. Our ability to obtain FDA approval of the BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines, and its timing, is uncertain. In addition, although Teoxane has received PMA approval for the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, it must obtain PMA approval by the FDA for the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products.\nFailure to comply with FDA and other applicable U.S. and foreign regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions or other actions, including:\n\u2022warning letters;\n\u2022civil and criminal penalties;\n\u2022injunctions;\n\u2022withdrawal of approved products;\n\u2022product seizure or detention;\n\u2022product recalls;\n\u2022total or partial suspension of production;\n\u2022refusal to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs; and\n\u2022refusal to approve PMAs or supplements to PMAs by our partners.\nPrior to obtaining approval to commercialize a product candidate in the U.S. or abroad, we or our collaborators must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies, that such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. Results from preclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we believe the preclinical and clinical data for our product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Administering product candidates to humans may produce undesirable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities denying approval of a product candidate for any or all targeted indications.\nIn addition, a number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including biotechnology companies, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, including in Phase 3 development, even after promising results in earlier preclinical studies or clinical trials. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful or that additional supportive studies will not be required, and the results of clinical trials by other parties may not be indicative of the results in trials we may conduct. For example, we completed the Phase 2 study of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the management of plantar fasciitis but determined in November of 2020 that we would not currently pursue the plantar fasciitis indication because neither dose used in the study met the primary efficacy endpoint of statistically significant improvement from baseline compared to placebo.\nEven with positive clinical trial results, there is the risk that the FDA or other regulatory authority identify deficiencies related to the manufacturing process of our product candidates. For example, on October 15, 2021, we announced that the FDA issued a CRL regarding the BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines due to deficiencies related to the FDA\u2019s onsite inspection at our manufacturing facility. We cannot be certain of whether we are able to address the outstanding observations of the FDA and remediate the deficiencies related to the manufacturing inspection or how quickly or successfully the regulatory approval process will move following our resubmission of the BLA, including how long it will take the FDA to reinspect the manufacturing facility and the extent to which the reinspection is successful.\nRegulatory approval of a BLA or PMA, or BLA or PMA supplement, is not guaranteed, and the approval process is expensive and may take several years. The FDA also has substantial discretion in the approval process. Despite the time and expense expended, failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials, or perform additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. The number of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for FDA approval varies depending on the product candidate, the disease or the condition that the product candidate is designed to address and the regulations applicable to any particular product candidate. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022our failure to remedy the deficiencies in our manufacturing processes or facilities identified by the FDA or by applicable foreign regulatory agencies, or the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract;\n\u2022our inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory body that the product candidate is safe and effective for the requested indication;\n\u2022our inability to demonstrate proof of concept of a product candidate or approved products in new indications;\n\u2022the FDA\u2019s or applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s disagreement with the trial protocol or the interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022our inability to demonstrate that clinical and other benefits of the product candidate outweigh any safety or other perceived risks;\n\u2022the FDA\u2019s or applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s requirement for additional preclinical or clinical studies;\n\u2022the FDA\u2019s or applicable foreign regulatory agency\u2019s non-approval of the formulation, labeling or the specifications of the product candidate; or\n\u2022the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agency significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nIf DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any future product candidates do not gain approval, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely harmed.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected the business of the FDA and other health authorities. In January 2022, the FDA announced the postponement of certain inspections due to the global impact of the omicron COVID-19 variant. The FDA indicated that it would perform inspections on a mission-critical basis, with the goal of resuming inspections as soon as possible. Given the continued uncertainty of the trajectory of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot be certain of when standard operations will resume, whether the FDA's ability to re-inspect our manufacturing facility will be delayed and whether the FDA regulatory process will take longer than the process pre-COVID-19. Interruption or delays in the operations of the FDA or other applicable local or foreign regulatory agencies caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may cause delays in meetings related to planned or completed clinical trials and may affect the review and approval timelines for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products or any future product candidate. Further, delays in the operations of the FDA or other applicable local or foreign regulatory agencies may result in delays or difficulties in obtaining required inspections of the facilities where we or third parties with whom we contract manufacture any of our product candidates or the raw materials used in the manufacture of our product candidates. If the COVID-19 pandemic and the related backlog of work, another government shutdown or other disruption to the normal functioning of government agencies occurs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or other reasons, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, including with respect to any resubmission of our BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines and the reinspection required for approval of the BLA, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects.\nThe RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers are Class III medical devices that require PMA approval before they may be commercialized in the U.S. Although Teoxane has received PMA approval for the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, we and Teoxane will be subject to ongoing and pervasive regulatory requirements governing, among other things, the manufacture, marketing, advertising, medical device reporting, sale, promotion, registration, and listing of these devices. For example, periodic reports must be submitted to the FDA as a condition of PMA approval. These reports include safety and effectiveness information about the device after its approval. Failure to submit such reports, or failure to submit the reports in a timely manner, could result in enforcement action by the FDA. Following its review of the periodic reports, the FDA might ask for additional information or initiate further investigation. Any failure to comply with the conditions of approval could result in the withdrawal of PMA approval and the inability to continue to market the device. The medical device regulations to which we are subject are complex and have become more stringent over time, and we have a limited history of operating as a distributor of Class III medical devices. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA, state or foreign regulatory authorities, including recalls, Dear Doctor letters and negative publicity which would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrently, the only products for which we have the rights to commercialize and that have been approved for sale by the applicable regulatory authorities are the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers. We may never obtain regulatory approval to commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, or future rights to the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products. Even if we eventually complete clinical testing and receive approval of any regulatory filing for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products or any future product candidates, the FDA or an applicable foreign regulatory agency may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly\nadditional post-approval clinical trials. The FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agency also may approve DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products or any future product candidates for a more limited indication or a narrower patient population than we originally requested, and the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory agency may not approve the labeling that we believe is necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates. The requirement to conduct additional clinical trials or our inability to obtain the requested label or indication could increase our expenses or limit our ability to generate revenue.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to, and other actual or threatened epidemics, pandemics, outbreaks, or public health crises may, adversely affect our financial condition and our business.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to an epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. An epidemic, pandemic, outbreak or other public health crisis could cause delays in regulatory approvals needed to commercialize our product candidates or interfere with enrollment and our ability to complete ongoing clinical trials on schedule or at all. The risk of a continued pandemic, or public perception of the risk, could cause customers to cancel or defer aesthetic and elective procedures, avoid public places, including hospitals and physician offices, and cause temporary or long-term disruptions in our supply chain, manufacturing and/or delays in the delivery of our inventory. Certain of these risks have materialized in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will further directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and research and development costs will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain, including variant strains of the virus and the degree of their vaccine resistance and as a result of new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions taken to contain or treat it, and the duration and intensity of the related effects. For instance, the FDA was previously unable to conduct the required inspection of our manufacturing facility in Northern California, due to the FDA\u2019s travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, following the FDA's completion of the site inspection, the issuance of a Form 483 and our response to the Form 483, it took longer to receive an action on the BLA from the FDA when compared to pre-COVID-19 pandemic timelines. The CRL received cited deficiencies related to manufacturing and we will be required to undergo a reinspection. We cannot be certain of how long it will take to remediate the deficiencies and respond to the FDA, whether the COVID-19 pandemic will delay the FDA in completing a reinspection, how quickly or successfully the regulatory approval process will move following our remediation of the deficiencies and our response to the FDA or the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the timing of the regulatory approval process for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in indications outside of glabellar lines or on any supplemental BLAs we may file. In addition, in March 2020 we paused enrollment in the JUNIPER Phase 2 adult upper limb spasticity trial, and ultimately enrolled fewer subjects, due to challenges related to the COVID-19 environment. We are unable to predict whether similar delays will occur in other clinical trials or whether such delays will delay regulatory approvals.\nMany of the Fintech Platform physician customers temporarily closed their offices and stopped performing procedures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and while most customers have reopened, a rise in infection rates, the development and spread of more contagious variants and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect their ability to stay open and the types of procedures performed. The spread of COVID-19 has also impacted our sales professionals\u2019 ability to travel, and medical facilities and physician offices have limited access for non-patients, including our sales professionals, which has had a negative impact on our access to customers and our ability to introduce the Fintech Platform and the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers to potential customers. We cannot be certain whether or to what extent these trends may continue, and if patients\u2019 financial circumstances or ability to or interest in receiving aesthetic procedures are materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or another pandemic or public health crisis, we may be unable to generate meaningful revenue in the near term or at all.\nPort closures, labor shortages and other restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have and may continue to disrupt our supply chain or limit our ability to obtain sufficient materials for our drug products and services. If Texoane is unable to access the raw materials needed for the production of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, or if we are unable to access the raw materials needed to manufacture DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, we may experience delays in our commercialization plans, regulatory approval process or development programs. In addition, the global chip shortage is currently impacting our third-party partners\u2019 ability to provide us with POS hardware terminals that are provided to customers as a part of the OPUL\u2122 service offering. If our third-party partner cannot provide enough POS terminals to meet OPULTM demand or we are unable to provide a substitute device, we may be unable to timely board new customers or fulfill orders for additional hardware from existing customers. Changes in U.S. and foreign trade policies or border closures related\nto the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, resulting in \u201ctrade wars\u201d, which may reduce customer demand for goods exported out of the U.S. if the parties having to pay those retaliatory tariffs increase their prices, or if trading partners limit their trade with the U.S. If these consequences are realized, the price to the consumer of aesthetic or therapeutic medical procedures from products exported out of the U.S. may increase, resulting in a material reduction in the demand for our future product candidates. Such a reduction may materially and adversely affect our potential sales and our business. In particular, under our Fosun License Agreement, we are responsible for manufacturing DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection and supplying it to Fosun, which would then develop, commercialize, market and sell it in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau. If this arrangement is restricted in any way due to the U.S.-China trade relationship or the COVD-19 pandemic, the contingent payments we are entitled to receive under the agreement, which are based on product sales, among other things, may be adversely affected. In addition, under the Teoxane Agreement, we are responsible for the commercialization of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers in the U.S. and rely on Teoxane for our entire supply of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, which was previously delayed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and may again be delayed in the future. Additional delays in the product supply of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers may have an adverse effect on our commercialization strategy.\nMoreover, an epidemic, pandemic, outbreak or other public health crisis, could require a complete or partial closure of one or more of our facilities, including our manufacturing facility, or cause employees to avoid our properties, which could adversely affect our ability to adequately staff and manage our businesses. For instance, \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d or other such orders by governmental authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted our operations. We curtailed employee travel and implemented a corporate work-from-home policy in March 2020. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, certain manufacturing, quality and laboratory-based employees continued to work onsite, and certain employees with customer-facing roles have been onsite for training and interfacing in-person with customers in connection with the product launch of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers. We have resumed essential on-site corporate operations and have begun to transition employees back on-site in accordance with local and regional restrictions. Although many of our employees have returned to working on-site, the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain, and a rise in infection rates, the development and spread of more contagious variants or other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may require that we transition back to work from home policies. Certain departments, like clinical, quality, quality control, manufacturing, supply chain and sales and marketing, are dependent on working on-site. The effective operation of certain of these departments is critical to manufacturing our drug substance and drug product needed for the resubmission of the BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines, the reinspection of the manufacturing facility and commercial preparation for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection and the completion of our clinical programs. If the employees in these departments are subject to work from home policies now or in the future, our business may be adversely impacted. In addition, continued reliance on personnel working from home may negatively impact productivity and employee morale, which may harm our business. In addition, this could increase our cyber security risk, create data accessibility concerns, and make us more susceptible to communication disruptions, any of which could adversely impact our business operations or delay necessary interactions with local and federal regulators, manufacturing sites, research or clinical trial sites, other important agencies and contractors, HintMD or RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers physician customers and other third parties with whom we do business.\nRisks related to an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could also negatively impact the business or operations of our sourcing or manufacturing partners, CROs, customers or other third parties with whom we conduct business.\nThese and other potential impacts of an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis, such as COVID-19 pandemic, has and could therefore materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nReports of adverse events or safety concerns involving the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers or other Teoxane approved product candidates could prevent Teoxane from maintaining regulatory approval of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, delay or prevent Teoxane from obtaining additional regulatory approval for the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products, or could negatively impact our sales of, the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers.\nReports of adverse events or safety concerns involving the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers or other Teoxane approved product candidates could result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities withdrawing approval of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers for any or all indications that have approval, including the use of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers for specified aesthetic indications and delay or prevent Teoxane from obtaining additional regulatory approval for the\nRHA\u00ae Pipeline Products. We cannot assure you that patients receiving the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers will not experience serious adverse events that require submission of postmarketing safety or medical device reports to the FDA. Adverse events, including with respect to dermal filler products generally, may also negatively impact demand for the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and future RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products, which could result in reduced sales. Teoxane may also be required to update package inserts and patient information brochures of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers based on reports of adverse events or safety concerns, which could adversely affect acceptance of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers in the market, make the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers less competitive or make it more difficult or expensive for us to commercialize the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers.\nWe may fail to realize the benefits expected from the HintMD Acquisition or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.\nOn July 23, 2020, we completed the HintMD Acquisition. The anticipated benefits we expect from the HintMD Acquisition are based on projections and assumptions about our combined businesses with HintMD, which may not materialize as expected or which may prove to be inaccurate. We may not realize the anticipated benefits within the anticipated time frame, or at all. The challenges involved in the commercial success of the Fintech Platform, which will be complex and time-consuming, include the following:\n\u2022significant issues with the acquired technology, security, product architecture and legal, regulatory and contractual compliance, among other matters that our due diligence process may have failed to identify;\n\u2022difficulties entering new markets and integrating new technologies in which we had no or limited direct experience prior to the HintMD Acquisition;\n\u2022our ability to comply with new and complex regulatory regimes and compliance standards applicable to the Fintech Platform;\n\u2022our ability to successfully launch OPUL\u2122 at scale;\n\u2022our ability to continue to fund the development and commercialization of the Fintech Platform;\n\u2022depending on third-party partners, such as Fiserv;\n\u2022technical or other difficulties faced by our aesthetic practice customers when using the Fintech Platform, which may negatively impact our existing or future customer relationships;\n\u2022limiting exposure to data and security breaches of consumer personal information used by the Fintech Platform;\n\u2022retaining and managing existing relationships with the Fintech Platform\u2019s customer base;\n\u2022developing new product features for OPUL\u2122 and delivering the anticipated benefits to physicians and patients;\n\u2022expanding sales and marketing efforts to effectively position OPUL\u2122 and expand its customer base;\n\u2022the Fintech Platform\u2019s ability to foster loyalty between physicians and their patients;\n\u2022evolving law relating to patent eligibility for patents related to computer-related inventions (e.g. software, business methods, computer security, database and data structures, computer networking, and graphical user interfaces) may be relevant to the scope of protection available for the Fintech Platform;\n\u2022entry of competitors to the market, including those with greater resources, experience and name recognition; the timing of development and release of new products, features and functionality and pricing by competitors; our ability to adapt to technological advancement in comparison to our competitors;\n\u2022changes in user preferences and growth or contraction in the addressable market;\n\u2022the increased scale and complexity of our operations resulting from the HintMD Acquisition;\n\u2022retaining our key employees and key employees of HintMD; and\n\u2022minimizing the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other important business objectives.\nFurther, the HintMD Acquisition has increased the size and scope of our business beyond the previous size and scope of either our or HintMD\u2019s previous businesses. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage our expanded and distinct business segments, which may pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs, regulatory requirements and complexity. We have also incorporated as a part of our aesthetics commercial strategy leveraging the Fintech Platform to expand and deepen customer relationships, enhance our prestige aesthetics offering and grow our U.S. aesthetics market opportunity. If we do not successfully manage these issues and other challenges inherent in integrating and expanding an acquired business of the size and complexity of HintMD, then we may need to alter our commercial strategy, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the HintMD Acquisition and our revenue, expenses, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Teoxane Agreement requires us to make specified annual minimum purchases of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and to meet specified expenditure levels in connection with our marketing of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers in furtherance of the commercialization of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, regardless of whether our commercialization efforts are successful. Such expenditure requirements may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business and our prospects for future growth, or may result in the termination of the Teoxane Agreement.\nThe Teoxane Agreement requires us to make specified annual minimum purchases of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, and to meet an annual minimum expenditure on marketing and other areas related to the commercialization of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, regardless of whether our commercialization efforts are successful. If we fail to meet the annual minimum purchase amount or the annual minimum marketing spending requirements specified in the Teoxane Agreement, Teoxane has the right to terminate the Teoxane Agreement.\nIf our commercialization efforts of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers are unsuccessful, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash flow to comply with such minimum purchase and expenditure requirements. Our obligation to Teoxane to meet such requirements could:\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy obligations with respect to our indebtedness, including the 2027 Notes, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of available cash flow to meet the minimum expenditure requirements, which will reduce the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022limit our ability to engage in strategic transactions or implement our business strategies;\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds; and\n\u2022place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors.\nAny of the factors listed above could materially and adversely affect our business and our results of operations.\nWorldwide economic and market conditions, an unstable economy, a decline in consumer-spending levels and other adverse developments, including inflation, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and liquidity.\nMany economic and other factors are outside of our control, including general economic and market conditions, consumer and commercial credit availability, inflation, unemployment, consumer debt levels, geopolitical events and other challenges affecting the global economy, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and conflicts between Ukraine and Russia. These factors could lead to disruption, instability, and volatility in global markets, increase inflation, disrupt supply chains, adversely affect consumer confidence and disposable income levels and have other impacts on our business. Lower consumer confidence and disposable incomes could lead to reduced consumer spending and lower demand for our products and services. Decreases in the number of physicians and physician offices or financial hardships for physicians may also adversely affect distribution channels of our products. A weak or declining economy or geopolitical events could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption. In addition, historically, during economic downturns, there have been reductions in spending on information technology as well as pressure for extended billing terms and other financial concessions. The adverse impact of economic downturns may be particularly acute among small and medium-sized plastic surgery and dermatology practices offering elective aesthetic procedures, which comprise the majority of the customer base of the Fintech Platform. If economic conditions deteriorate, current and prospective customers of the Fintech Platform may elect to decrease their information technology budgets or cancel subscriptions to the Fintech Platform, which would limit our ability to grow the Fintech Platform business. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an economic recession characterized by business closures and limited social interaction as well as higher levels of unemployment and reductions in working hours. Elective aesthetic procedures are discretionary and less of a priority for those patients that have lost their jobs, are furloughed, have reduced work hours or have to allocate their cash to other priorities and essential items. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, we may continue to experience negative impacts to our business and financial results due to the continued perceived risk of infection or concern of a resurgence of the COVID-19 outbreak as well as COVID-19\u2019s global economic impact, including decreases in consumer discretionary spending and any economic slowdown or recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could also limit our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. These factors could have a negative impact on our potential sales and operating results.\nWe are currently, and in the future may be, subject to securities class action and stockholder derivative actions. These, and potential similar or related litigation, could result in substantial damages and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business.\nWe are currently, and may in the future be, the target of securities class actions or stockholder derivative claims. On December 10, 2021, a putative securities class action complaint was filed against the Company and certain of its officers on behalf of a class of stockholders who acquired the Company\u2019s securities from November 25, 2019 to October 11, 2021. The complaint alleges that the Company and certain of its officers violated sections 10(b) and 20(a) of Exchange Act by making false and misleading statements regarding the manufacturing of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection and the timing and likelihood of regulatory approval and seeks unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the putative class and an award of costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees. This and any such other actions or claims could result in substantial damages and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business. and otherwise harm our business.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of any future products we develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability lawsuits as a result of commercializing the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, if approved, and as a result of the clinical testing of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, or any other product candidates. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products. Even a successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022decreased demand for the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any future product candidates or products we develop;\n\u2022injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022withdrawal of clinical trial participants or cancellation of clinical trials;\n\u2022costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022a diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022regulatory investigations, product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022loss of revenue;\n\u2022an increase in product liability insurance premiums or an inability to maintain product liability insurance coverage; and\n\u2022the inability to continue to commercialize the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers or commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any other products we develop.\nOur inability to obtain and maintain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost and scope of coverage to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers or any future products we develop. Although we maintain product liability insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions and deductibles, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We will have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts. Moreover, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses.\nIf we are not successful in discovering, developing, acquiring and commercializing additional product candidates other than the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, our ability to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives may be impaired.\nAlthough a substantial amount of our effort has focused on the commercialization of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and the continued clinical testing and regulatory approval of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, our strategy also includes the discovery, development and commercialization of other neuromodulator products for both aesthetic and therapeutic indications, including the onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar. We may seek to do so through our internal research programs, strategic collaborations and product acquisitions.\nEven if we identify an appropriate collaboration or product acquisition, we may not be successful in negotiating the terms of the collaboration or acquisition, or effectively integrating the collaboration or acquired product into our existing business and operations. Moreover, we may not be able to pursue such opportunities if they fall within the non-compete provision of the Teoxane Agreement, which prohibits us from developing, manufacturing, marketing, selling, detailing or promoting any hyaluronic acid dermal filler (other than the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers) in the U.S. during the term of the Teoxane Agreement. We have limited experience in successfully acquiring and integrating products and technologies into our business and operations, and even if we are able to consummate an acquisition or other investment, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments. We may face risks, uncertainties and disruptions, including difficulties in the integration of the operations and services of these acquisitions. If we fail to successfully integrate collaborations, assets, products or technologies that we enter into or acquire, or if we fail to successfully exploit acquired product distribution rights and maintain acquired relationships with customers, our business could be harmed. Furthermore, we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities in connection with proposed collaborations or to pay for any product acquisitions or investments, the issuance of which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders. Identifying, contemplating, negotiating or completing a collaboration or product acquisition and integrating an acquired product or technology could significantly divert management and employee time and resources.\nOur onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar program is still in the preclinical stage and our other programs are in the discovery or preclinical state. Research programs to identify product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources, whether or not any product candidates are ultimately identified. Our research and preclinical programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022the research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential product candidates;\n\u2022competitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete or less attractive;\n\u2022product candidates we develop may nevertheless be covered by third parties\u2019 patents or other exclusive rights;\n\u2022a product candidate may on further study be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be effective or otherwise does not meet applicable regulatory criteria;\n\u2022a product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all;\n\u2022a product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community or third-party payors, if applicable; and\n\u2022intellectual property rights of third parties may potentially block our entry into certain geographies or make such entry economically impracticable.\nIf we fail to develop and successfully commercialize other product candidates other than the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, our future prospects may be harmed and our business will be more vulnerable to problems that we encounter in commercializing the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and in developing and commercializing DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection.\nWe may use third-party collaborators to help us develop, validate or commercialize product candidates, and our ability to commercialize such product candidates could be impaired or delayed if these collaborations are unsuccessful.\nWe may continue to license or selectively pursue strategic collaborations for the development, validation and commercialization of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, hyaluronic acid filler products, and any future product candidates. For instance, in February 2018, we and Viatris entered into the Viatris Collaboration, as amended in August 2019, pursuant to which we and Viatris are collaborating exclusively, on a world-wide basis (excluding Japan), to develop, manufacture and commercialize our onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar product candidate. In December 2018, we and Fosun entered into the Fosun License Agreement pursuant to which we have granted Fosun the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in the Fosun Territory and certain sublicense rights. In addition, we entered into the Teoxane Agreement in January 2020, as amended in September 2020, pursuant to which Teoxane granted us the exclusive right to import, market, promote, sell and distribute the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products in the U.S., its territories and possessions. In any third-party collaboration, we are dependent upon the success of the collaborators to perform their responsibilities with continued cooperation. Our collaborators may not cooperate with us or perform their obligations under our agreements with them. We cannot control the amount and timing of our collaborators\u2019 resources that will be devoted to performing their responsibilities under our agreements with them. Our collaborators may choose to pursue alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us. The development, validation and commercialization of our product candidates will be delayed if collaborators fail to conduct their responsibilities in a timely manner or in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or if they breach or terminate their collaboration agreements with us. Disputes with our collaborators could also impair our reputation or result in development delays, decreased revenues and litigation expenses.\nIf our information technology systems or data, or those of third parties upon which we rely, are or were compromised, we could experience adverse consequences resulting from such compromise, including but not limited to regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and penalties; disruptions of our business operations; reputational harm; loss of revenue or profits; loss of customers or sales; and other adverse consequences.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we may collect, store, use, transmit, disclose, or otherwise process proprietary, confidential, and sensitive data, including personal data (such as health-related data), intellectual property, and trade secrets. We may rely upon third parties service providers and technologies to operate critical business systems to process confidential information and personal data in a variety of contexts, including, without limitation, third-party providers of cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email and other functions. Our ability to monitor these third parties\u2019 cybersecurity practices is limited, and these third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place. We may share or receive sensitive data with or from third parties.\nCyberattacks, malicious internet-based activity, and online and offline fraud are prevalent and continue to increase. These threats are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. These threats come from a variety of sources. In addition to traditional computer \u201chackers,\u201d threat actors, personnel (such as through theft or misuse), sophisticated nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors now engage in attacks.\nWe and the third parties upon which we rely may be subject to a variety of evolving threats, including but not limited to social-engineering attacks (including through phishing attacks), malicious code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks (such as credential stuffing), personnel misconduct or error, ransomware attacks, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, adware, telecommunications failures, earthquakes, fires, floods, and other similar threats. Ransomware attacks, including those perpetrated by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, are becoming increasingly prevalent and severe and can lead to significant interruptions in our operations, loss of data and income, reputational harm, and diversion of funds. Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware attack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations prohibiting such payments. Similarly, supply-chain attacks have increased in frequency and severity, and we cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our supply chain or our third-party partners\u2019 supply chains have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems (including the Fintech Platform) or the third-party information technology systems that support us and our services. The COVID-19 pandemic and our remote workforce poses increased risks to our information technology systems and data, as more of our personnel work from home, utilizing network connections outside our premises. Future business transactions (such as acquisitions or integrations) could expose us to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, as our systems, including that of our Fintech Platform, could be negatively affected by vulnerabilities present in acquired or integrated entities\u2019 systems and technologies.\nAny of the previously identified or similar threats could cause a security incident or other interruption. A security incident or other interruption could result in unauthorized, unlawful, or accidental acquisition, modification, destruction, loss, alteration, encryption, disclosure of, or access to data. If such an event were to occur, it could result in a material disruption of our product development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed, ongoing or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. In addition, where cardholder data is compromised, we might be responsible for payment of network fines levied pursuant to payment network rules and regulations. Likewise, we rely on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates and to conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their information technology systems could also harm our business. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems, the confidentiality and the availability and integrity of our data, and these risks apply both to us, and to third parties on whose systems we rely for the conduct of our business.\nWe may expend significant resources or modify our business activities (including our clinical trial activities) in an effort to protect against security incidents. Certain data privacy and security obligations may require us to implement and maintain specific security measures, industry-standard or reasonable security measures to protect our information technology systems, including that of our Fintech Platform, and data. While we have implemented security measures designed to protect against security incidents, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective. We may be unable in the future to detect vulnerabilities in our information technology systems, including the Fintech Platform, because such threats and techniques change frequently, are often sophisticated in nature, and may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. Despite our efforts to identify and remediate vulnerabilities, if any, in our information technology systems, including the Fintech Platform, our efforts may not be successful. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address any such identified vulnerabilities.\nApplicable data privacy and security obligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders of security incidents. Such disclosures are costly, and the disclosures or the failure to comply with such requirements could lead to adverse consequences. If we (or a third party upon whom we rely) experience a security incident or are perceived to have experienced a security incident, we may experience adverse consequences. These consequences may include: government enforcement actions (for example, investigations, fines, penalties, audits, and inspections); additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; restrictions on processing data (including personal data); litigation (including class claims); indemnification obligations; negative publicity; reputational harm; monetary expenditures; interruptions in our operations (including availability of data); financial loss; and other similar harms. Security incidents and attendant consequences may cause delays in the development of our product candidates, cause customers to stop using our products or our Fintech Platform, deter new customers from using our products or our Fintech Platform, and negatively impact our ability to grow and operate our business.\nOur contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in our contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our data privacy and security obligations. We cannot be sure that our insurance coverage will be adequate or sufficient of protect us from or to mitigate liabilities arising out of our privacy and security practices, that such coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that such coverage will pay future claims.\nIf we fail to attract and retain qualified management, clinical, scientific, technical and sales personnel, we may be unable to successfully execute our objectives.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management, clinical, scientific, technical and sales personnel. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary, particularly as business prospects change, including the recent delay in the approval of the BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines. The inability to recruit or loss of the services of key employees might impede the progress of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nLeadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage. Resignations of executive officers may cause disruption in our business, strategic and employee relationships, which may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives. Leadership changes may also increase the likelihood of turnover in other key officers and employees and may cause declines in the productivity of existing employees. The search for a replacement officer may take time, further exacerbating these factors. Identifying and hiring an experienced and qualified executive officer are typically difficult. Periods of transition in senior management leadership are often difficult as the new executives gain detailed knowledge of our operations and may result in cultural differences and friction due to changes in strategy and style. During the transition periods, there may be uncertainty among investors, employees, creditors and others concerning our future direction and performance.\nRisks Related to the Manufacturing and Supply Chain\nWe currently make our DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection clinical drug product exclusively in one internal manufacturing facility. We plan to utilize internal and external facilities, including through one or more third-party contractors, in the future to support clinical and commercial production if our product candidates are approved. If we experience a significant disruption in our manufacturing operations or our third-party manufacturers experience a significant disruption in their operations for any reason, our ability to continue to operate our business would be materially harmed.\nWe currently manufacture our own clinical drug product to support DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection development in one internal manufacturing facility. We plan to utilize our internal and external ABPS and LSNE facilities to provide multiple sources of clinical and commercial production of our drugs candidates. If these or any future facility were to be damaged, destroyed or otherwise unable to operate, whether due to earthquakes, fire, floods, hurricanes, storms, tornadoes, other natural disasters, employee malfeasance, terrorist acts, power outages, actual or threatened epidemics, pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), outbreaks, or public health crises, or otherwise, or if performance of such manufacturing facilities is disrupted for any other reason, such an event could make it difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us or our third-party manufacturers to continue to manufacture our drug product for a substantial period of time. In\nparticular, because we manufacture botulinum toxin in our facilities, we would be required to obtain further clearance and approval by state, federal or other applicable authorities to continue or resume manufacturing activities. Although we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, they may not be adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which, particularly when taken together with our lack of earthquake insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may also need to halt manufacturing operations, which could impact our ability to be inspected for the BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, or halt or delay our clinical trials or, if our product candidates are approved, be unable to manufacture our product candidates to meet commercial demand. If we experience delays in achieving our development or regulatory objectives, or if we are unable to manufacture an approved product within a timeframe that meets market demands, our business, prospects, financial results and reputation could be materially harmed.\nIf DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection is approved, we will face certain risks associated with manufacturing DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection to support commercial production.\nWe have developed an integrated manufacturing, research and development facility located at our Newark, California office. We manufacture drug substance and drug product at this facility that we use for research and development purposes, clinical trials and ultimately for commercial supplies post regulatory approval. We may never be able to successfully operate our manufacturing facility to support commercial scale. There are risks associated with commercial manufacturing including, among others, cost overruns, process reproducibility, stability issues, lot consistency and timely availability of raw materials. If DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection is approved, there is no assurance that we will be successful in operating a commercial scale manufacturing process that can support commercial demand. If DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection is approved, we may need to expand our manufacturing facilities, add manufacturing personnel and ensure that validated processes are consistently implemented in our facilities and outsource manufacturing responsibilities with third-party manufacturers. The upgrade and expansion of our facilities and the use of third-party manufacturer facilities will require additional regulatory approvals. In addition, it will be costly and time-consuming to expand our facilities and recruit necessary additional personnel. We entered into the ABPS Services Agreement and LSNE Agreement to provide additional sources of manufacturing for our product candidates, however, there are no assurances that either or both sources will continue to be available to us at the required commercial scale, or at all. If we are unable to expand our manufacturing facilities in compliance with regulatory requirements, to hire additional necessary manufacturing personnel, or retain our third-party manufacturers, we may encounter delays or additional costs in achieving our commercialization objectives, which could materially damage our business and financial position.\nWe currently contract with third-party manufacturers for certain components and services necessary to produce our product candidates and expect to continue to do so to support further clinical trials and commercial scale production if our product candidates are approved. This increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or be able to obtain such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe currently rely on third-party manufacturers for certain components and services necessary to produce DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, and we expect to continue to rely on these and other manufacturers to support our commercial requirements if DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or other product candidates are approved. In particular, we plan to utilize our internal and the external ABPS and LSNE facilities, and we use other service providers for testing to support clinical and commercial production of product candidates, if approved. We may never be able to rely on additional suppliers or service providers to support clinical development or commercialization of our product candidates, if approved. Even where alternative sources of supply or other service providers are available, qualifying alternate suppliers and service providers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or could result in delays and a loss of revenues. As a result, we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers and service providers for our product candidates and the loss of one of our suppliers or service providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails other additional risks, including the reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party, and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us. In addition, third-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP or QSR, or similar regulatory requirements outside the U.S. Our failure or the failure of our third-party manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations could result in\nsanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our product candidates or products that we may develop. Any failure or refusal to supply the components or services for our product candidates or products that we may develop could delay, prevent or impair our clinical development or commercialization efforts.\nWe rely on Teoxane for the manufacture and supply of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, and our dependence on Teoxane may impair our ability to commercialize the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers.\nPursuant to the Teoxane Agreement, we are not entitled to manufacture the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers. Instead, Teoxane is responsible for supplying all of our requirements for the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers. If Teoxane were to cease production or otherwise fail to timely supply us with an adequate supply of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, our ability to commercialize the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers would be adversely affected. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, product supply of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers was delayed by Teoxane, as they temporarily suspended production in Geneva, Switzerland. Teoxane resumed manufacturing operations at the end of April 2020 and delivered the first shipment of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers to us in June 2020. As a result, the initial product launch of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers was delayed by one quarter to September 2020. Additional delays in the product supply of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers may have an adverse effect on our commercialization strategy.\nTeoxane is required to produce the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers under QSR in order to meet acceptable standards for commercial sale. If such standards change, the ability of Teoxane to produce the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers on the schedule we require to meet commercialization goals may be affected. Teoxane is subject to pre-approval inspections and periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign authorities to ensure strict compliance with QSR and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over Teoxane\u2019s compliance with these regulations and standards. Any difficulties or delays in Teoxane\u2019s manufacturing and supply of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers or any failure of Teoxane to maintain compliance with the applicable regulations and standards could increase our costs, cause us to lose revenue, prevent the import and/or export of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, or cause the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers to be the subject of field alerts, recalls or market withdrawals.\nWe depend on single-source suppliers for the raw materials necessary to produce DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, and any other product candidates. The loss of these suppliers, or their failure to supply us with these raw materials, could negatively affect our business.\nWe and our manufacturers purchase the materials necessary to produce DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for our clinical trials from single-source third-party suppliers. There are a limited number of suppliers for the raw materials that we use to manufacture our product candidates, and we may need to assess alternate suppliers to prevent a possible disruption of the manufacture of the materials necessary to produce our product candidates for our clinical trials and, if approved, ultimately for commercial sale. In particular, we outsource the manufacture of bulk peptide through an agreement with a single supplier.\nWe do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of raw materials by our manufacturers. Although we generally do not begin a clinical trial unless we believe that we have a sufficient supply of a product candidate to complete the clinical trial and while we have taken steps to ensure we are sufficiently scaled to support expected future commercial demands, any significant delay in the supply of the raw material components of a product candidate could considerably delay completion of our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval of such product candidates. If we or our manufacturers are unable to purchase these raw materials on acceptable terms and at sufficient quality levels or in adequate quantities if at all, the development of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection and any future product candidates, or the commercial launch of any approved products, would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to meet our development objectives for our product candidates or generate revenues from the sale of any approved products.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials and we and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur sales, marketing, research and development and manufacturing activities and our third-party manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials owned by us, including botulinum toxin type A, a key component of our product candidates, and other hazardous compounds. We and our manufacturers and suppliers are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. We are licensed with the CDC and with the California Department of Health, Food and Drug Branch for use of botulinum toxin and to manufacture both the active pharmaceutical ingredient and the finished product in topical and injectable dose forms. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our and our manufacturers\u2019 facilities pending their use and disposal. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities. Such damages and liability could exceed our resources and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of certain materials and interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance.\nRisks Related to Marketing and Commercialization\nEven if DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products, or any future product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may never achieve market acceptance or commercial success.\nEven if we obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products or any future product candidates may not achieve market acceptance among physicians and patients, and may not be commercially successful, which could harm our financial results and future prospects.\nThe degree and rate of market acceptance of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products or any future product candidates for which we receive approval depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the safety, efficacy and duration of the product as compared to existing and future therapies;\n\u2022the clinical indications for which the product is approved and patient demand for the treatment of those indications;\n\u2022acceptance by physicians, major operators of clinics and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022the extent to which physicians recommend the products to their patients;\n\u2022the proper training and administration of the products by physicians and medical staff such that patients do not experience excessive discomfort during treatment or adverse side effects;\n\u2022patient satisfaction with the results and administration of the product and overall treatment experience;\n\u2022the potential and perceived advantages and cost of the product over alternative treatments;\n\u2022the willingness of patients to pay for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products and other aesthetic treatments in general, relative to other discretionary items, especially during economically challenging times, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the willingness of third-party payors to reimburse physicians or patients for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection and any future products we may commercialize for therapeutic indications;\n\u2022the revenue and profitability that the product will offer a physician as compared to alternative therapies;\n\u2022the relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of adverse events;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, including efforts by any third parties we engage;\n\u2022consumer sentiment about the benefits and risks of aesthetic procedures generally and our products in particular; and\n\u2022general consumer, patient and physician confidence and availability of practicing physicians, which may be impacted by general economic and political conditions, including challenges affecting the global economy resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAny failure by our product candidates or the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers to achieve market acceptance or commercial success would materially adversely affect our results of operations and delay, prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue and continue our business.\nIn addition, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection has only been used in clinical trials to date. Therefore, the commercial or real-world experience may yield different outcomes or patient experiences due to variations in injection techniques, dilution approaches and dosing levels employed by different physician and nurse injectors. As a result, these market-based approaches may differ from our clinical trial design and could negatively impact efficacy, duration, safety and adoption.\nOur product candidates, if approved, and the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers will face significant competition, and our failure to effectively compete may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration and expansion. In addition, our competitors may develop products that are safer, more effective, more convenient or less expensive than the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and our product candidates, if approved, which could reduce or eliminate our commercial opportunity.\nSuccessful competitors in the pharmaceutical and medical device markets have the ability to efficiently and effectively discover therapies, obtain patents, develop, test and obtain regulatory approvals for products, and effectively commercialize, market and promote approved products, including communicating the effectiveness, safety and value of products to actual and prospective customers and medical staff. Numerous companies are engaged in developing, patenting, manufacturing and marketing healthcare products which we expect will compete with our products. Many of these competitors are large, experienced companies that enjoy significant competitive advantages, such as substantially greater financial, research and development, manufacturing, testing, personnel and marketing resources, greater brand recognition and more experience and expertise in obtaining marketing approvals from the FDA and other regulatory authorities.\nUpon marketing approval, the first expected use of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar will be in aesthetic medicine. Competition in aesthetic products is significant and dynamic and is characterized by substantial technological development and product innovations, and our competitors include large, fully-integrated pharmaceutical companies and more established biotechnology and medical device companies. We anticipate that DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, if approved, will face significant competition from existing injectable neuromodulators as well as unapproved and off-label treatments. Further, if approved, in the future we may face competition for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection from biosimilar products and products based upon botulinum toxin. In addition, the only products we are currently commercializing are the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers. It is possible that competitors will succeed in developing technologies that are safer, more effective, more convenient or that have a lower cost of goods and price than those used in DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, if approved, or the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and in our product candidates, or that would render our technology obsolete or noncompetitive. Competition could also result in reduced profit margins and limited sales, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor a variety of reasons, including less stringent regulatory requirements, there are significantly more aesthetic products and procedures available for use in a number of foreign countries than are approved for use in the U.S. There are also fewer limitations on the claims that our competitors in certain countries can make about the effectiveness of their products and the manner in which they can market them.\nWe may not be successful in continuing to execute our sale and marketing strategy for the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and in executing our sales and marketing strategy for the commercialization of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines, if approved.\nWe have limited prior experience in the marketing, sale and distribution of aesthetic products and no experience with the marketing, sale and distribution of therapeutic products or any products internationally. Establishing and maintaining sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities involve significant risks, including our ability to retain and incentivize qualified individuals, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel, generate sufficient sales leads, effectively manage a sales and marketing team, and handle any unforeseen costs and expenses.\nIn August 2020, we built a commercial sales and marketing organization to prepare for the commercial launch of the Current RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines, if approved, in the U.S. If the approval and commercial launch of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines is further delayed or does not occur for any reason, we may lose members of our sales and marketing organization. Any failure to maintain adequate internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of our products and services, including the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, and may result in a breach of our obligations to Teoxane under the Teoxane Agreement. We also have to compete with other pharmaceutical and life sciences companies to recruit, hire, train and retain sales and marketing personnel, and turnover in our sales force and marketing personnel could negatively affect the commercialization of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and, if it receives regulatory approval, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection. We may not be able to attract and retain quality personnel on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe will also need to increase our sales force or contract with distributors and partners if we obtain regulatory approval for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for any therapeutic indications we are pursuing or to expand internationally. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for therapeutic indications or any future product candidates internationally. Establishing and maintaining sales, marketing and distribution capabilities may be expensive and time consuming. Such expenses may be disproportionate compared to the revenues we may be able to generate on sales of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, if approved, and the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, which could cause our commercialization efforts to be unprofitable or less profitable than expected.\nIf we are found to have improperly promoted off-label uses for our products that are approved for marketing, including the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and, if approved for marketing, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, or if physicians misuse our products or use our products off-label, we may become subject to prohibitions on the sale or marketing of our products, significant fines, penalties, and sanctions, product liability claims, and our image and reputation within the industry and marketplace could be harmed.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the marketing and promotional claims that are made about regulated products, such as the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and, if approved, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses or indications that are not approved by the FDA or such other regulatory agencies as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may receive warning letters, become subject to significant liability and be subject to FDA prohibitions on the sale or marketing of our products, which could affect our reputation within the industry and materially harm our business. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. If we become the target of such an investigation or prosecution based on our marketing and promotional practices, we could face similar sanctions, which would materially harm our business. In addition, management\u2019s attention could be diverted from our business operations, significant legal expenses could be incurred, and our reputation could be damaged. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.\nPhysicians may, in their independent medical judgment, prescribe legally available products for off-label uses. However, physicians may also misuse the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and, if approved, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or our other products, or use improper techniques, potentially leading to adverse results, side effects or injury, which may lead to product liability claims. If these products are misused or used with improper technique, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients. Product liability claims could divert management\u2019s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend, and result in sizable damage awards against us that may not be covered by insurance.\nFurthermore, the use of these products for indications other than those cleared by the FDA may not effectively treat such conditions, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace among physicians and patients.\nAny of these events could harm our business and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.\nWe are subject to uncertainty relating to third-party reimbursement policies which, if not favorable for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any future product candidates for therapeutic indications, could hinder or prevent their commercial success.\nOur ability to commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any future product candidates for therapeutic indications such as cervical dystonia or adult upper limb spasticity will depend in part on the coverage and reimbursement levels set by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the effectiveness of and prices charged for medical products and services. We may not obtain adequate third-party coverage or reimbursement for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any future product candidates for therapeutic indications, or we may be required to sell them at a discount.\nReimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the third-party payor\u2019s determination that use of a product is: (i) a covered benefit under its health plan; (ii) safe, effective and medically necessary; (iii) appropriate for the specific patient; (iv) cost-effective; and (v) neither experimental nor investigational. Our business would be materially adversely affected if we do not receive coverage and adequate reimbursement of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for therapeutic indications, if approved, from private insurers on a timely or satisfactory basis. No uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors in the U.S.; therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Further, coverage under certain government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, may not be available for certain of our product candidates. As a result, the coverage determination process will likely be a time-consuming and costly process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for a product for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. Our business could also be adversely affected if third-party payors limit the indications for which DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection will be reimbursed to a smaller patient set than we believe they are effective in treating.\nIn some foreign countries, particularly Canada and European countries, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to strict governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to 12 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory approval and product launch. To obtain favorable reimbursement for the indications sought or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our products, including DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, to other available therapies. If reimbursement for our product is unavailable in any country in which reimbursement is sought, limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be materially harmed.\nRisks Related to Research and Development\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Furthermore, we rely on CROs, and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials. While we have agreements governing the committed activities of our CROs, we have limited influence over their actual performance. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Furthermore, final results may differ from interim results.\nWe have and may again experience delays in our ongoing clinical trials, and we do not know whether future clinical trials, if any, will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll an adequate number of subjects on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. For example, enrollment in the JUNIPER Phase 2 adult upper limb spasticity trial was paused in March\n2020 due to challenges related to the COVID-19 environment. In June 2020, we announced the decision to end screening and complete enrollment in the JUNIPER trial. We completed the JUNIPER trial in February of 2021 with 83 subjects enrolled. The JUNIPER Phase 2 trial achieved one co-primary endpoint, which evaluated the change in the MAS score from baseline, demonstrating a statistically significant treatment benefit in the 500 unit treatment group compared with placebo. Statistical significance was not achieved on the second co-primary endpoint, however numerical improvement compared with placebo in all three doses on the PGIC assessment was achieved. Although we believe the JUNIPER Phase 2 trial provided sufficient data to inform our dosing strategy and design for a successful Phase 3 program, we cannot guarantee that the results of the Phase 3 program will generate positive results.\nClinical trials can be delayed or aborted for a variety of reasons, including delay or failure to:\n\u2022obtain regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u2022reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022obtain IRB approval at each site;\n\u2022recruit suitable subjects to participate in a trial;\n\u2022have subjects complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022ensure clinical sites observe trial protocol or continue to participate in a trial;\n\u2022address any patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial;\n\u2022address any conflicts with new or existing laws or regulations;\n\u2022add a sufficient number of clinical trial sites;\n\u2022manufacture sufficient quantities of product candidate for use in clinical trials; or\n\u2022lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nSubject enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials and is affected by many factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs or treatments that may be approved for the indications we are investigating.\nWe could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by the data safety monitoring board for such trial or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. Such authorities may suspend or terminate a clinical trial due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, failure of inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, discovery of unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions, risks related to conducting clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic, or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nDelays in the completion or termination of any clinical trial of our product candidates will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. In addition, many of the factors that cause or lead to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe currently rely on third parties and consultants to conduct all of our preclinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties or consultants do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any future product candidates.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct preclinical studies or clinical trials. We rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories, collaborative partners and other third parties, such as CROs and clinical data management organizations, to conduct clinical trials on our product candidates. The third parties with whom we contract for execution of our clinical trials play a significant role in the conduct of these trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. However, these third parties are not our employees, and except for contractual duties and obligations, we have limited ability to control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. Although we rely on these third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with GCPs and good laboratory practices for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical and preclinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate, and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials. We also rely on consultants to assist in the execution, including data collection and analysis, of our clinical trials.\nIn addition, the execution of preclinical studies and clinical trials, and the subsequent compilation and analysis of the data produced, requires coordination among various parties. In order for these functions to be carried out effectively and efficiently, it is imperative that these parties communicate and coordinate with one another. Moreover, these third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. These third parties may terminate their agreements with us upon as little as 30 days\u2019 prior written notice of a material breach by us that is not cured within 30 days. Many of these agreements may also be terminated by such third parties under certain other circumstances, including our insolvency or our failure to comply with applicable laws. In general, these agreements require such third parties to reasonably cooperate with us at our expense for an orderly winding down of services of such third parties under the agreements. If the third parties or consultants conducting our clinical trials do not perform their contractual duties or obligations, experience work stoppages, do not meet expected deadlines, terminate their agreements with us or need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical trial protocols or GCPs, or for any other reason, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials or enter into new arrangements, which could be difficult, costly or impossible, and our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated or may need to be repeated. We may be unable to recover unused funds from these third-parties. If any of the foregoing were to occur, we may not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, regulatory approval for, and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize the product candidate being tested in such trials.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf Teoxane fails to obtain and maintain patent, licensing arrangements or other protection for the proprietary intellectual property that we have exclusive distribution rights to, we could lose our rights related to the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, which would have a material adverse effect on our potential to generate revenue, our business prospects, and our results of operations.\nIf Teoxane fails to obtain and maintain patent, licensing arrangements or other protection for the proprietary intellectual property that we have exclusive distribution rights to, we could lose our rights to the intellectual property or our exclusivity with respect to those rights, and our competitors could market competing products using the intellectual property. The intellectual property underlying the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers is of critical importance to our business and involves complex legal, business and scientific issues and is complicated by the rapid pace of scientific discovery in our industry. Disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to the Teoxane Agreement, including:\n\u2022the scope of rights granted under the Teoxane Agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u2022the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of Teoxane that is not subject to the Teoxane Agreement;\n\u2022the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships; and\n\u2022the ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the development of intellectual property under the Teoxane Agreement.\nIf disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected products or product candidates.\nIf our efforts to protect our intellectual property related to DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers or any future product candidates, including an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, are not adequate, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, our onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, and our development programs. Any disclosure to or misappropriation by third parties of our confidential proprietary information could enable competitors to quickly duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thereby eroding our competitive position.\nThe strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. This uncertainty includes changes to the patent laws through either legislative or court action that may reinterpret existing law in ways affecting the scope or validity of issued patents. The evolving law relating to patent eligibility for patents related to our business may be relevant to the scope of protection available to us. The patent applications that we own or license may fail to result in issued patents in the U.S. or foreign countries. Competitors and academic scientists in the field of cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and neuromodulators have created a substantial amount of prior art, including scientific publications, patents and patent applications. Our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents depends on whether the differences between our technology and the prior art allow our technology to be patentable over the prior art. Even if the patents do successfully issue, third parties are challenging and may again challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of such issued patents or any other issued patents we own or license, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. For example, on May 2, 2019 our European Patent No. EP 2 490 986 B1 for \u201cMethods and Systems For Purifying Non-Complexed Botulinum Neurotoxin\u201d was opposed. On June 10, 2021, we successfully defended the patent in the European Patent Office with the patent being upheld with amendments to certain claims. The opponent appealed our successful opposition defense to the Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office. We subsequently filed an appeal to preserve our ability to use all arguments throughout the appeal process. Furthermore, even if our patents and applications are unchallenged, they may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims.\nIn addition, the patent laws of the U.S. provide procedures for third parties to challenge the validity of issued patents. Patents issued from applications filed after March 15, 2013 may be challenged by third parties using the post-grant review procedure which allows challenges for a number of reasons, including prior art, sufficiency of disclosure, and subject matter eligibility. Under the inter partes review procedure, any third party may challenge the validity of any issued U.S. Patent in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) on the basis of prior art patents or printed publications. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in the USPTO compared to district courts, third parties may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents and patent applications we hold or pursue with respect to DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar or any future product candidates is challenged, then it could threaten our ability to commercialize that product candidate, and could threaten our ability to prevent competitive products from being marketed. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, or any future product candidates under patent protection would be reduced.\nSince patent applications in the U.S. and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to either (i) file any patent application related to our product candidates or (ii) invent any of the inventions claimed in our patents or patent applications. Furthermore, for applications filed before March 16, 2013, or patents issuing from such applications, an interference proceeding can be provoked by a third party, or instituted by the\nUSPTO to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications and patents. Under the current \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention, a third party that files a patent application in the USPTO before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we made the invention before it was made by the third party.\nEven where laws provide protection, costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce, defend and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and the outcome of such litigation would be uncertain. Moreover, any actions we may bring to enforce our intellectual property against our competitors could provoke them to bring counterclaims against us. Some of our competitors have substantially greater intellectual property portfolios and financial resources than we have. See Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors-If we infringe or are alleged to infringe intellectual property rights of third parties, our business could be harmed\u201d for more information.\nWe also rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that may not be patentable, processes for which patents may be difficult to obtain or enforce and any other elements of our product development and manufacturing processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents.\nIn an effort to protect our trade secrets and other confidential information, we require our employees, consultants, collaborators and advisers to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties. These agreements, however, may not provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information, and these agreements may be breached. Adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. A breach of confidentiality could significantly affect our competitive position. In addition, in some situations, these agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants, collaborators or advisers have previous employment or consulting relationships. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use any intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in any related or resulting know-how and inventions. Also, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and other confidential information.\nIf we infringe or are alleged to infringe intellectual property rights of third parties, our business could be harmed.\nOur research, development and commercialization activities may infringe or otherwise violate or be claimed to infringe or otherwise violate patents owned or controlled by other parties. Competitors in the field of cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and neuromodulators have developed large portfolios of patents and patent applications in fields relating to our business. For example, there are patents held by third parties that relate to the treatment with neuromodulator products for indications we are currently developing. There may also be patent applications that have been filed but not published that, when issued as patents, could be asserted against us. These third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages and/or we could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us, during the pendency of the litigation, we could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit.\nAs a result of patent infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be required to seek licenses from third parties. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product based on our current or future indications, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms.\nThere has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical industry. We have been and in the future may be subject to this type of litigation and these types of proceedings. In October 2021, Allergan filed a complaint against us and ABPS, one of our manufacturing sources of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement of the following patents assigned and/or licensed to Allergan, U.S. Patent Nos. 11,033,625; 7,354,740; 8,409,828; 11,124,786; and 7,332,567. On November 3, 2021, we filed a motion to dismiss. Allergan filed an amended complaint on November 24, 2021, reasserting the patents in its original Complaint and adding U.S. Patent No. 11,147,878. We filed another motion to dismiss in December 2021, but cannot be certain the motion will be granted. See \u201cPart I-Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d for more information. We may be delayed or prevented from commercializing DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection as a result of Allergan\u2019s lawsuit against us, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue. In addition, if we are found to infringe upon these patents, other patents or other intellectual property rights, or if we fail to obtain or renew a license under a patent or other intellectual property right from Allergan or other third parties, or if a third party that we are licensing technologies from is found to infringe upon a patent or other intellectual property rights of another third party, we may be required to pay damages, halt or delay commercialization, suspend the manufacture of our products or reengineer or rebrand our products, if feasible, re-design the manufacturing process for our products, which would require FDA review and could halt or delay commercialization, or we may be unable to enter certain new product markets.\nIn addition to infringement claims against us, we may become a party to other patent litigation and other proceedings, including interference, derivation or post-grant proceedings declared or granted by the USPTO and similar proceedings in foreign countries, regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our current or future products. The cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time, financial and other resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace and negatively impact our reputation and stock price. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits or administrative proceedings to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property or the patents of our licensors, or to challenge patent claims of third party patents which could be expensive and time-consuming.\nCompetitors may infringe upon our intellectual property, including our patents or the patents of our licensors. As a result, we may in the future be required to file infringement claims to stop third-party infringement or unauthorized use of our own or licensed intellectual property. This can be expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patent claims do not cover its technology or that the factors necessary to grant an injunction against an infringer are not satisfied.\nAn adverse determination of any litigation or other proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. On May 2, 2019 our European Patent No. EP 2 490 986 B1 for \u201cMethods and Systems For Purifying Non-Complexed Botulinum Neurotoxin\u201d was opposed. On June 10, 2021, we successfully defended the patent in the European Patent Office with the patent being upheld with amendments to certain claims. The opponent appealed our successful opposition defense to the Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office. We subsequently filed an appeal to preserve our ability to use all arguments throughout the appeal process.\nInterference, derivation, inter partes review, post-grant review or other proceedings brought at the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority or patentability of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors or collaborators, or those of our competitors. For example, On July 1, 2021, we filed two petitions (IPR2021-01203 and IPR2021-01204) requesting inter partes review (\"IPR\") of Medy-Tox, Inc. (\u201cMedy-Tox\u201d), U.S. patent 9,480,731, titled \u201cLong Lasting Effect of New Botulinum Toxin Formulations.\u201d On January 19, 2022, the USPTO Trial and Appeal Board denied institution of the IPRs, and on February 18, 2022, we filed a motion for a rehearing of the decision. In 2013, Medy-Tox had exclusively licensed its technology covered by this patent to Allergan plc which subsequently was acquired by AbbVie. On September 8, 2021, Medy-Tox announced that its exclusive technology transfer agreement with AbbVie was terminated and rights for Medy-Tox\u2019s technology covered by the patent would be returned to Medy-Tox. We\ncontinue to take appropriate measures to defend our position. This IPR proceeding, litigation or other USPTO proceedings brought by us may fail or may be invoked against us by third parties.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or other proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation or proceeding. In addition, during the course of this kind of litigation or proceeding, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments or public access to related documents. If investors perceive these results to be negative, the market price for our common stock could be significantly harmed.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the U.S. can be less extensive than those in the U.S. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the U.S. and in some cases may even force us to grant a compulsory license to competitors or other third parties. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the U.S., or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the U.S. or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies to develop their own products in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the U.S. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. Periodically, we may review the patents and patent applications we have pending throughout the world and decide to abandon one or more of them if we determine such patents or applications would not make a strategic contribution to our business. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nIn addition, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in domestic and foreign intellectual property laws.\nUse of \u201copen source\u201d software for the Fintech Platform could adversely affect our ability to provide the Fintech Platform and subject us to possible claims.\nThe Fintech Platform incorporates open source software and we expect to continue to use open source software in the future. We may face claims from others claiming ownership of open source software, or seeking to enforce the terms of, an open source license, including by demanding release of the open source software or derivative works thereof, or of our proprietary source code associated with such open source software. These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change the Fintech Platform, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and operating results. In addition, if the license terms for the open source software we utilize changes, we may be forced to reengineer the Fintech Platform or incur additional costs. Although we have implemented policies to regulate the use and incorporation of open source software into the Fintech Platform, we cannot be certain that we have not incorporated open source software in the Fintech Platform in a manner that is inconsistent with such policies.\nAny failure to protect intellectual property rights associated with the Fintech Platform could impair our ability to protect the proprietary technology and brand of the Fintech Platform.\nWe have five issued patents and 16 pending patent applications related to the Fintech Platform. However, there is no guarantee that the pending patent applications will result in issued patents, or that the issued patents will ultimately be determined to be valid and enforceable. We also have three pending trademark applications in the United States, one pending trademark application in Australia, and one pending trademark application in Canada related to the Fintech Platform. We primarily rely on copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality or other protective agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect the intellectual property rights associated with the Fintech Platform. However, the steps we take to protect those intellectual property rights may be inadequate to prevent others from competing with the Fintech Platform.\nTo protect the intellectual property rights associated with the Fintech Platform, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor, protect and enforce these rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce those intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management, and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of such intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce the intellectual property rights associated with the Fintech Platform may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of those intellectual property rights. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce the intellectual property rights associated with the Fintech Platform could adversely affect the Fintech Platform brand and adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to the Fintech Platform\nIf we are not able to increase the use and adoption of OPUL\u2122 and maintain and enhance its brand, then we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the HintMD Acquisition.\nIn October 2021, we announced the commercial launch of OPUL\u2122 and made it generally available. OPUL\u2122 is a registered PayFac. As a PayFac, OPUL\u2122 earns revenue by charging fees for completing payment transactions and other payment-related services based on the volume of activity processed on the platform. Although OPUL\u2122 has launched, it has only been installed in limited accounts and HintMD customers will need to be transitioned from the HintMD Platform to OPUL\u2122. In order to increase revenue generated by the Fintech Platform, we need to expand the customer base significantly and maintain the HintMD Platform until we can transition HintMD Platform customers to OPUL\u2122 successfully. We have limited experience operating as a PayFac, and practices and their patient customers may experience issues as a result of performance problems associated with the transition to OPUL\u2122 and may not be satisfied with the OPUL\u2122 experience in comparison to the HintMD Platform experience. If practices and their patient customers do not continue to utilize the HintMD Platform through the transition, OPUL\u2122 is not widely adopted by new customers or new customers to OPUL\u2122 are not satisfied with their experience, then our ability to expand and deepen aesthetic customer relationships and expectations for revenue growth through OPUL\u2122 will not be achieved.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing the Fintech Platform reputation as a differentiated payments processing platform serving the medical aesthetic industry is critical to our relationship with the existing customers of the Fintech Platform and our ability to attract new customers and may also result in the generation of new aesthetic product customers for Revance. The successful promotion of the Fintech Platform's brand attributes will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to: target and have OPUL\u2122 adopted by premier accounts; increase loyalty between practices and patients; continue to develop high-quality software; successfully differentiate OPUL\u2122 from competitive products and services; fund and achieve success in sales and marketing efforts and successfully transition practices from the HintMD Platform to OPUL\u2122.\nThe transition of practices from the HintMD Platform to OPUL\u2122, product enhancements and continued development of OPUL\u2122 and the promotion of OPUL\u2122 will require us to make substantial expenditures, and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as we seek to expand OPUL\u2122. We may not have sufficient funds to successfully complete these product development and marketing activities. In addition, to the extent that these activities generate increased revenue, this revenue may not offset the expenses we incur. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance the Fintech Platform offerings, it could lose customers or fail to attract potential new customers. As a result, we may not generate meaningful revenue from the Fintech Platform, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, or we may not realize the anticipated benefits from the HintMD Acquisition.\nThe HintMD Acquisition may result in impairment charges from the recording of goodwill and intangible assets that could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by impairment charges from the recording of goodwill and intangible assets incurred in connection with the HintMD Acquisition. The amount and timing of these possible charges are not yet known. If such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to their estimated fair value, with a charge against earnings. Further, our failure to identify or accurately assess the magnitude of necessary technology investments we are assuming as a result of the HintMD Acquisition could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting charges, a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nInterruptions or performance problems associated with the Fintech Platform technology, infrastructure or service offerings may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe continued growth of the Fintech Platform depends in part on the ability of users to access the Fintech Platform at any time and within an acceptable amount of time. The Fintech Platform is proprietary, and it relies on the expertise of members of engineering, operations and software development teams for its continued performance. Disruptions to these departments and functions, some of which are outsourced, could result in product feature and enhancement delays and interruptions to or performance problems associated with the Fintech Platform. For example, the Fintech Platform contracts with engineers located in Ukraine whom may be adversely impacted by the conflict between Russian and Ukraine, which in turn may delay some product development efforts and the delivery of product and feature enhancements. In addition, we depend on external data centers, such as Amazon\u2019s AWS, to host the Fintech Platform applications and have integrated third-party services that we rely upon as critical components of the Fintech Platform application. We do not control the operation of these facilities. The Fintech Platform has experienced minor disruptions, outages and performance problems in the past, and may in the future experience disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, introductions of new functionality, human or software errors, delays in scaling of the technical infrastructure (such as if we do not maintain enough excess capacity or accurately predict the infrastructure requirements of the Fintech Platform), capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing the Fintech Platform simultaneously, denial-of-service or other cyber-attacks or other security-related incidents. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve the performance of the Fintech Platform, especially during peak usage times and as the Fintech Platform becomes more complex and its user traffic increases. As a result, the Fintech Platform may become unavailable or users may be unable to access the Fintech Platform within a reasonable amount of time. In the event of any of the factors described above, or certain other failures of our infrastructure or that of third-parties we rely on, user data may be permanently lost. If the Fintech Platform experiences significant periods of service downtime in the future, we may be subject to claims by users of the Fintech Platform. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed, continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology and efficiently resolve interruptions or performance problems with the Fintech Platform, existing relationships with practices would be adversely affected and the Fintech Platform brand could be harmed. In addition to technological and infrastructure problems, if customers of the Fintech Platform experience other issues or are unsatisfied with the service offerings or operations of the Fintech Platform, this could result in poor relationships with practices and reputational harm to OPUL\u2122 and, as a result, poor customer relations and reputational harm to Revance.\nThe business and growth of the Fintech Platform depend in part on the success of its strategic relationships with third parties, including payments partners, platform partners and technology partners.\nWe depend on, and anticipate that we will continue to depend on, various third-party relationships in order to sustain and grow the Fintech Platform. We are highly dependent upon partners for certain critical features and functionality of the Fintech Platform, including secure data centers, a sponsor bank and third-party payment processors.\nWe depend on hardware providers and third-party processing partners to perform payment processing services to make the Fintech Platform work. For example, we rely on Fiserv to provide the payment gateway services that enables the Fintech Platform to process payments, and if Fiserv is unable to continue to supply processing for the Fintech Platform, the performance of the Fintech Platform system could be adversely affected and its growth would be limited. Its processing partners and suppliers may go out of business or otherwise be unable or unwilling to continue providing such services, which could significantly and materially reduce its payments revenue and disrupt its business. In addition, users of the Fintech Platform may be subject to quality issues related to its third-party processing partners or it may become involved in\ncontractual disputes with its processing partners, both of which could impact the Fintech Platform's and Revance's reputation and adversely impact customer relationships and the Fintech Platform's ability to generate revenue.\nIf we were no longer able to use our current third-party processing partners, we may be required to migrate to other third-party payment partners in the future. The initiation of these relationships and the transition from one relationship to another could require significant time and resources, and establishing these new relationships may be challenging. Further, any new third-party payment processing relationships may not be as effective, efficient or well received by users of the Fintech Platform, nor is there any assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement with such processing partners. Contracts with such processing partners may be less economically beneficial to us than existing relationships. In addition, for pricing, technological or other reasons, existing customers may not agree to migrate to a new payments provider, which may reduce the Fintech Platform customer base and decrease the profitability of the Fintech Platform.\nIn addition to a third-party payment processor, another payment partner required for OPUL\u2122 to act as a PayFac is an acquiring bank that is a member of the payment networks. The acquiring bank acquires and settles funds on behalf of its customers. The acquiring bank may change their underwriting criteria such that continued use of the acquiring bank would render OPUL\u2122 processing services unprofitable, the acquiring bank may itself encounter difficulties unrelated to OPUL\u2122 or payment network rules may be amended rendering the acquiring bank incapable of processing for OPUL\u2122 customers. Any of these occurrences could interfere with the ability of OPUL\u2122 to secure effective and profitable payment processing services for its customers, which would disrupt the OPUL\u2122 business, increase its expenses and impact the services it could provide to its customers.\nIn addition, failure of these or any of our technology providers to maintain, support or secure their technology platforms in general, and integrations in particular, or errors or defects in their technology, could materially and adversely impact customer relationships, damage the OPUL\u2122 reputation and brand, and harm the business of the Fintech Platform. In addition, any failure by the software provided by the Fintech Platform third party vendors may cause us to fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations and could expose us to regulatory, financial, or reputational risk. The Fintech Platform third-party partners may also suffer disruptions or weakness in their businesses, including those that require changes to their technological integration specifications or payment transaction risk management protocols, which could increase costs to the Fintech Platform to maintain compatibility, decrease sales or require us to source new partners.\nAdditionally, we rely on third-parties for the provision of the hardware terminal on which OPUL\u2122 operates. Due to our reliance on third-parties for hardware, any disruptions in their ability to supply OPUL\u2122 customers with hardware could directly impact our ability to onboard new customers. Specifically, the global chip shortage is currently impacting our third-party partners\u2019 ability to provide us with POS hardware terminals that are provided to customers as a part of the OPUL\u2122 service offering. If our third-party partner cannot provide enough POS terminals to meet OPULTM demand or we are unable to provide a substitute device, we may be unable to timely board new customers or fulfill orders for additional hardware from existing customers. If the shortage continues for an extended period of time, it could materially and adversely affect the Fintech Platform\u2019s business.\nIdentifying, negotiating and documenting relationships with strategic third parties requires significant time and resources. In addition, integrating third-party technology is complex, costly and time-consuming. Our agreements with these partners are typically limited in duration, non-exclusive and do not prohibit them from working with the Fintech Platform's competitors or from offering competing services.\nIf we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining relationships with these strategic third parties, our ability to compete in the payments marketplace could be impaired, and as a result the Fintech Platform's business may negatively be impacted, and we may not realize the benefits of the HintMD Acquisition.\nSubstantial and increasingly intense competition in the payment processing industry may harm the Fintech Platform business. Further, the Fintech Platform is dependent on payment card networks and third-party payment processors, and any changes to their fee structures could harm the Fintech Platform business.\nThe markets in which the Fintech Platform competes are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change. We compete with a wide range of companies ranging from small start-up enterprises with limited resources to very large companies which can leverage significantly larger customer bases and greater financial resources.\nMany of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, and sales and marketing resources, greater brand recognition, better relationships with third-party service providers and a larger customer base than we do. We anticipate that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies and we may not be able to compete successfully with them.\nBecause the Fintech Platform operates in a highly competitive marketplace, there can be significant downward pressure on the pricing we may charge our customers for the processing of credit cards in order to remain competitive in the marketplace. The Fintech Platform's competitors may be able to offer similar or lower rates to their customers alongside a more comprehensive set of financial services products that allows them to offset a reduction in processing margins.\nAdditionally, costs associated with the processing of credit cards are not directly under our control. The expenses related to the processing of credit cards include interchange fees, assessment fees, and other related costs payable to a third-party payment processor. From time to time, these fees have increased and may continue to do so in the future. An increase in the fee structure may adversely affect the Fintech Platform's margins and we may not realize the benefits of the HintMD Acquisition.\nRisks Related to Government and Industry Regulation\nOur business and products are subject to extensive government regulation.\nWe are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving regulation by federal and state governmental authorities in the U.S., principally by the FDA, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the CDC, and foreign regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements, including those promulgated under FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, and Controlled Substances Act, may subject us to operating restrictions and criminal prosecution, monetary penalties and other disciplinary actions, including, sanctions, warning letters, product seizures, recalls, fines, injunctions, suspension, revocation of approvals, or exclusion from future participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nAfter our other products receive regulatory approval, we, and our direct and indirect suppliers, will remain subject to the periodic inspection of our plants and facilities, review of production processes, and testing of our products to confirm that we are in compliance with all applicable regulations. Adverse findings during regulatory inspections may result in the implementation of Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies programs, completion of government mandated clinical trials, and government enforcement action relating to labeling, advertising, marketing and promotion, as well as regulations governing manufacturing controls noted above.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar or any future product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense, may limit or delay regulatory approval and may subject us to penalties if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements.\nOnce and if regulatory approval has been granted, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any approved product will be subject to continual regulatory review by the FDA and/or (if applicable) non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Any regulatory approvals that we or our collaborators receive for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products or any future product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved indications for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. In addition, if the applicable regulatory agency approves DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products or any future product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMP and GCPs for any clinical trials conducted post-approval. The RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers are currently subject to such extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements, reports, registration and continued compliance. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers or any future product candidates, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u2022restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u2022fines, warning letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\u2022refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by us or our strategic collaborators, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\u2022product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and\n\u2022injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;\nany of which could be harmful to our ability to generate revenues and our stock price.\nAny failure of Teoxane to maintain compliance with the applicable regulations and standards for the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and reports of adverse events or safety concerns could increase our costs, cause us to lose revenue, prevent the import and/or export of the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, cause the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers to be recalled or withdrawn and prevent us from successfully commercializing the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers.\nOur ongoing regulatory requirements may also change from time to time, potentially harming or making costlier our commercialization efforts. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the U.S. or other countries. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.\nAll of the RHA\u00ae Pipeline Products and any of our product candidates approved in the future will be subject to ongoing FDA and foreign regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review with respect to manufacturing.\nWe and any third-party contract development and manufacturers or suppliers are required to comply with applicable cGMP regulations and other international regulatory requirements. The regulations require that our product candidates be manufactured and records maintained in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing and quality control/quality assurance activities. Manufacturers and suppliers of materials must be named in a BLA submitted to the FDA for any product candidate for which we are seeking FDA approval. The RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers are subject to the FDA\u2019s QSR for medical devices. Additionally, third party manufacturers and suppliers and any manufacturing facility must undergo a pre-approval inspection before we can obtain marketing authorization for any of our product candidates. Even after a manufacturer has been qualified by the FDA, the manufacturer must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full compliance with cGMP and QSR, as applicable. Manufacturers are subject to regular, periodic inspections by the FDA following initial approval. Further, to the extent that we contract with third parties for the supply and/or manufacture of our products (for example, Teoxane with respect to the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers and ABPS and LSNE with respect to our product candidates), our ability to control third-party compliance with FDA requirements will be limited to contractual remedies and rights of inspection.\nIf, as a result of the FDA\u2019s inspections, it determines that the equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may not approve the product or may suspend the manufacturing operations. If the manufacturing operations of any of the suppliers for our product candidates are suspended, we may be unable to generate sufficient quantities of commercial or clinical supplies of product to meet market demand, which would harm our business. In addition, if delivery of material from our suppliers were interrupted for any reason, we might be unable to ship our approved product for commercial supply or to supply our products in development for clinical trials. Significant and costly delays can occur if the qualification of a new supplier is required.\nWe are subject to stringent and changing obligations related to data privacy and security. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and penalties; disruptions of our business operations; reputational harm; loss of revenue or profits; loss of customers or sales; and other adverse business consequences.\nWe process personal data and other sensitive data (including health data we collect through our Fintech Platform and about trial participants in connection with clinical trials); proprietary and confidential business data; trade secrets; intellectual property; and sensitive third-party data. Our data processing activities, including our activities related to the Fintech Platform, subject us to numerous data privacy and security obligations, such as various laws, regulations, guidance, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, contracts, and other obligations that govern the processing of personal data by us and on our behalf.\nIn the United States, federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including data breach notification laws, personal data privacy laws, and consumer protection laws. These privacy laws include, without limitation, the following laws and regulations: Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\u201cTCPA\u201d) and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d). HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH\u201d), imposes specific requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information. The Fintech Platform may in certain circumstances, process protected health information and thus such processing may be subject to HIPAA. The TCPA imposes specific requirements relating to marketing to individuals using technology such as telephones, mobile devices, and text messages. TCPA violations can result in significant financial penalties, as businesses can incur penalties or criminal fines imposed by the Federal Communications Commission or be fined up to $1,500 per violation through private litigation or state attorneys general or other state actor enforcement. Class action suits are the most common method for private enforcement. The CCPA imposes obligations on businesses to which it applies that include, but are not limited to, providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording California residents certain rights related to their personal data. The CCPA allows for statutory fines for noncompliance (up to $7,500 per violation). In addition, it is anticipated that the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (\u201cCPRA\u201d), effective January 1, 2023, will expand the CCPA. For example, the CPRA establishes a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the CPRA, which could increase the risk of an enforcement action. Other states, like Colorado and Virginia, have enacted data privacy laws which differ from the CPRA and become effective in 2023. If we are or become subject to these laws and/or new or amended data privacy laws, the risk of enforcement actions against us could increase because we may be subject to obligations under applicable regulatory frameworks and the number of individuals or entities that could initiate actions against us may increase (including individuals via a private right of action), in addition to further complicating our compliance efforts.\nIn addition, privacy advocates and industry groups have proposed, and may propose in the future, standards with which we are legally or contractually bound to comply. For example, we are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (\u201cPCI DSS\u201d) in connection with our Fintech Platform. The PCI DSS requires companies to adopt certain measures to ensure the security of cardholder information, including using and maintaining firewalls, adopting proper password protections for certain devices and software, and restricting data access. Our operations related to the Fintech Platform are contractually required to maintain compliance with current PCI DSS as part of our information security program and to undergo periodic PCI DSS audits undertaken by third party auditors (\u201cPCI Audits\u201d). Noncompliance with PCI-DSS can result in penalties ranging from $5,000 to $100,000 per month by credit card companies, litigation, damage to our reputation, and revenue losses. We may also rely on vendors to process payment card data, and those vendors may be subject to PCI DSS, and our business may be negatively affected if our vendors are fined or suffer other consequences as a result of PCI DSS noncompliance. Further, If we cannot comply with or if we incur a violation of any of these standards or contractual requirements, or if we have findings resulting from a PCI Audit and we fail to undertake timely corrective action, we could incur significant liability through fines and penalties imposed by credit card associations or other organizations or litigation with relevant stakeholders, either of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, failure to comply with the PCI DSS obligations or the contractual obligations of the Fintech Platform, including timely and sufficient mitigation of any findings from a PCI Audit, could also result in the termination of OPULTM\u2019s status as a registered PayFac, thereby dramatically impairing our ability to continue doing business in the payments industry, or we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their costs of issuing new cards and related expenses.\nOutside the United States, an increasing number of laws, regulations, and industry standards apply to data privacy and security. For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cEU GDPR\u201d) and the equivalent law in the United Kingdom (\u201cUK GDPR\u201d) impose strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals, including sensitive data that we may process such as health data. For example, under the EU GDPR, government regulators may impose temporary or definitive bans on data processing, as well as fines of up to 20 million euros or 4% of annual global\nrevenue, whichever is greater. Similar processing penalties and fines exist under the UK GDPR and the uncertainty of data protection laws in the UK following Brexit has increased the complexity of our compliance efforts. Further, individuals may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data.\nCertain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws. For example, absent appropriate safeguards or other circumstances, the EU GDPR, UK GDPR, and laws in Switzerland generally restrict the transfer of personal data to countries such as the United States that do not provide an adequate level of personal data protection. The European Commission released a set of \u201cStandard Contractual Clauses\u201d that are designed to be a valid mechanism by which entities can transfer personal data out of the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of protection. Currently, these Standard Contractual Clauses are a valid mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the EEA. The Standard Contractual Clauses, however, require parties that rely upon that legal mechanism to comply with additional obligations, such as conducting transfer impact assessments to determine whether additional security measures are necessary to protect the at-issue personal data. Moreover, due to potential legal challenges, there exists some uncertainty regarding whether the Standard Contractual Clauses will remain a valid mechanism for transfers of personal data out of the EEA. Similar restrictions and transfer mechanisms exist under the UK GDPR. Any of these restrictions and obligations could increase the cost and complexity of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. If we cannot implement valid compliance mechanisms for cross-border personal data transfers, we may face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines, and injunctions against processing or transferring personal data from Europe or elsewhere. The inability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, including by limiting our ability to conduct clinical trial activities in Europe, the United Kingdom and elsewhere; limiting our ability to collaborate with third parties, such as contract research organizations as well as other service providers, that are subject to European and other data privacy and security laws; or requiring us to increase our personal data processing capabilities and infrastructure in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense.\nOur obligations related to data privacy and security are quickly changing in an increasingly stringent fashion, creating some uncertainty as to the effective future legal framework. Additionally, these obligations may be subject to differing applications and interpretations, which may be inconsistent or in conflict among jurisdictions. Preparation for and compliance with these obligations requires us to devote significant resources (including, without limitation, financial and time-related resources). These obligations may necessitate changes to our Fintech Platform, information technologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. Although we endeavor to comply with all applicable data privacy and security obligations, we may at times fail (or be perceived to have failed) to do so. Despite our efforts, our personnel or third parties upon whom we rely may fail to comply with such obligations, which could negatively impact our business operations and compliance posture. For example, any failure by a third-party processor to comply with applicable law, regulations, or contractual obligations could result in adverse effects, including inability to operate our business and proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. Moreover, clinical trial subjects about whom we or our potential collaborators obtain information, as well as the third-party providers (such as contract research organizations) who share this information with us, may contractually limit our ability to use and disclose the information.\nIf we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, we could face significant consequences. These consequences may include, but are not limited to, government enforcement actions (e.g., investigations, fines, penalties, audits, inspections, and similar); litigation (including class-related claims); additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; bans on processing personal data; and orders to destroy or not use personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition, including but not limited to: loss of customers; interruptions or stoppages in our business operations (including our clinical trials); inability to process personal data or to operate in certain jurisdictions; limited ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates; expenditure of time and resources to defend any claim or inquiry; adverse publicity; or revision or restructuring of our operations.\nIf we fail to obtain regulatory approvals in foreign jurisdictions for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, or any future product candidates including an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, we will be unable to market our products outside of the U.S.\nIn addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing manufacturing, clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of our future products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product\ncandidate, we must obtain approval of the product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before commencing clinical trials or marketing in those countries. The approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional clinical testing, or the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one or more foreign regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals or to do so on a timely basis, and even if we do file, we may not receive the necessary approvals to commercialize our products in geographies outside of the U.S.\nFurther, interruption or delays in the operations of applicable foreign regulatory agencies caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may affect the review and approval timelines of such agencies for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, RHA\u00ae 1 or any future hyaluronic acid filler products developed pursuant to the Teoxane Agreement or any future product candidates.\nThe RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, and, if approved, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar or any other products, may cause or contribute to adverse medical events that we are required to report to regulatory agencies and if we fail to do so, we could be subject to sanctions that would materially harm our business.\nAs we continue to commercialize the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, and if we are successful in commercializing DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection or any other products, including an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, the FDA and foreign regulatory agency regulations require that we report certain information about adverse medical events if those products may have caused or contributed to those adverse events. The timing of our obligation to report would be triggered by the date we become aware of the adverse event as well as the nature of the event. We may fail to report adverse events we become aware of within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to appreciate that we have become aware of a reportable adverse event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if it is an adverse event that is unexpected or removed in time from the use of our products. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA or a foreign regulatory agency could take action including criminal prosecution, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, seizure of our products, or delay in approval or clearance of future products.\nWe may in the future be subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and fraud laws, and any violations by us of such laws could result in fines or other penalties.\nWhile we do not expect that DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, if approved for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar (frown) lines, or the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers to subject us to all of the various U.S. federal and state laws intended to prevent healthcare fraud and abuse, we may be subject to, or in the future become subject to, additional laws in connection with the use of these products for treatment of therapeutic indications or any future product candidates. The federal anti-kickback statute prohibits the offer, receipt, or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of patients or the use of products or services that would be paid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced price items and services. Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the ACA to a stricter standard such that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Further, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d). Many states have similar laws that apply to their state healthcare programs as well as private payors.\nThe federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the FCA impose liability on persons who, among other things, present or cause to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, for services not provided as claimed, or for services that are not medically necessary. The FCA includes a whistleblower provision that allows individuals to bring actions on behalf of the federal government and share a portion of the recovery of successful claims.\nHIPAA imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.\nHIPAA also imposes, among other things, certain standards and obligations on covered entities including certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective business associates and subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity relating to the privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting of individually identifiable health information.\nThe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS information related to certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members.\nWe may also be subject to analogous state laws and regulations, including: state anti-kickback and false claims laws, state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources, state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities, and state and local laws that require the registration of our pharmaceutical sales representatives.\nState and federal authorities have aggressively targeted pharmaceutical manufacturers for alleged violations of these anti-fraud statutes for a range of activities, such as those based on improper research or consulting contracts with physicians and other healthcare professionals, certain marketing arrangements that rely on volume-based pricing, off-label marketing schemes, inappropriate billing and other improper promotional practices. Companies targeted in such prosecutions have paid substantial fines in the hundreds of millions of dollars or more, have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans, and have often become subject to consent decrees severely restricting the manner in which they conduct business. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. If we become the target of such an investigation or prosecution based on our activities such as contractual relationships with providers or institutions, or our marketing and promotional practices, including any Fintech Platform rewards programs, we could be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative sanctions, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs, imprisonment, additional reporting requirements, and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired.\nAlso, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, future distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.\nLegislative or regulatory healthcare reforms in the U.S. may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearance or approval of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar, or any future product candidates and to produce, market, and distribute such products if clearance or approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory clearance or approval, manufacture, and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the \u201cACA\u201d) was passed in March 2010, and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and continues to significantly impact the U.S. biotechnology industry. There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, the former U.S. presidential administration signed several Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation to repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA\u2019s individual mandate to carry health insurance. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period that began in February 2021, which has been extended through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how the future challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.\nIn addition, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the costs of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the former U.S. presidential administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the former presidential administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration\u2019s proposals, which have resulted in additional regulations from the FDA, CMS and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. For example, on November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing the former presidential administration\u2019s Most Favored Nation executive order to tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored Nation model, on December 27, 2021, CMS published a final rule that rescinded the Most Favored Nation Model interim final rule. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have been delayed until January 1, 2023 by the Biden administration. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, \u201cPromoting Competition in the American Economy,\u201d with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden\u2019s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. It is unclear whether these similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of, or affect the price that we may charge for, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, or any future product candidates including an onabotulinumtoxinA biosimilar. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs on our commercialization efforts for the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could require, among other things:\n\u2022changes to manufacturing methods;\n\u2022recall, replacement, or discontinuance of one or more of our products; and\n\u2022additional recordkeeping.\nEach of these would likely entail substantial time and cost and could materially harm our business and our financial results. In addition, delays in receipt of or failure to receive regulatory clearances or approvals for any future products would harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur failure to maintain licenses and other authorizations to enable us to act as a distributor of Teoxane\u2019s RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers or comply with such licensing requirements could result in fines or other penalties.\nAs the distributor of Teoxane\u2019s RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers, we are required to maintain certain licenses, registrations, permits, authorizations, approvals or other types of state and local permissions in order to comply with various regulations regarding the distribution of medical devices, and must cooperate with Teoxane in the event of any medical device reports (adverse events) or product recalls. Satisfaction of regulatory requirements may take many months, and may require the expenditure of substantial resources. Failure to comply with such regulatory requirements can result in enforcement actions, including the revocation or suspension of licenses, registrations or accreditations, and can also subject us to plans of correction, monitoring, civil monetary penalties, civil injunctive relief and/or criminal penalties. Failure to maintain state regulatory approval will also prevent distribution of products where such approval is necessary and will limit our ability to generate revenue. As we have limited prior experience in the distribution of medical devices, we cannot be certain that the compliance infrastructure we have built will be sufficient to continue to support these activities.\nChanges in funding for the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, the ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nThe Fintech Platform is subject to extensive regulation and industry compliance requirements associated with operating as a PayFac, and its failure to comply with such regulation and requirements could negatively impact our business.\nThe financial services offered by the Fintech Platform are subject to legal, regulatory, and card brand requirements, including those regarding anti-money laundering, sanctions, fraud, and consumer financial protection. All Fintech Platform operations are conducted by certain Revance employees, and, as a result, those employees and the operations of Revance as it relates to the Fintech Platform will be subject to these regulations and requirements. Noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in: civil or criminal penalties that could increase our expenses and adversely impact our business operations; the termination of the Fintech Platform\u2019s key supplier agreements, such as its Payment Facilitator Agreement; assessment of significant fines or monetary penalties; damage to our brand and reputation; loss of Fintech Platform customers, and poor financial performance. In addition, changes in applicable laws and regulations or changes in interpretations and enforcement practices may in turn require increased operating costs or capital expenditures to implement operational changes. Unforeseen regulatory changes may also limit our ability to offer certain products or services, or impact the competitiveness of products or services offered by the Fintech Platform. If we are no longer able to offer the full suite of Fintech Platform services or expand its services to appeal to a larger consumer base, the Fintech Platform brand and reputation may be harmed, customer retention and procurement may be negatively impacted, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the HintMD Acquisition.\nRisks Related to Our 2027 Notes\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or refinance our indebtedness, including the 2027 Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control, including global macroeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the 2027 Notes in cash or to repurchase the 2027 Notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the 2027 Notes.\nHolders of the 2027 Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2027 Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture for the 2027 Notes) at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the 2027 Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the 2027 Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the 2027 Notes surrendered therefor or notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the 2027 Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the 2027 Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the 2027 Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the 2027 Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the 2027 Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the 2027 Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2027 Notes is triggered, holders of 2027 Notes will be entitled to convert the 2027 Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their 2027 Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their 2027 Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 2027 Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nConversion of the 2027 Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the 2027 Notes may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. Upon conversion of the 2027 Notes, we have the option to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. If we elect to settle our conversion obligation in shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 2027 Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the 2027 Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the 2027 Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe trading price of our common stock is volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nThe trading price of our common stock is highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. For example, the closing price of our common stock from January 1, 2021 to February 14, 2022 has ranged from a low of $12.36 to a high of $17.07. The stock markets in general and the markets for pharmaceutical biopharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in particular have experienced extreme volatility that may have been for reasons that are related or unrelated to the operating performance of the issuer. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022announcements of regulatory approval or disapproval of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers or any future product candidates;\n\u2022regulatory or legal actions, developments and guidance in the U.S. and foreign countries, such as the receipt of the CRL related to the BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of glabellar lines or our ability to respond to the manufacturing deficiencies raised by the CRL;\n\u2022our ability to continue as a going concern;\n\u2022our success or lack of success in commercializing the RHA\u00ae Collection of dermal fillers;\n\u2022results from or delays in clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u2022introductions and announcements of new products by us, any commercialization partners or our competitors, and the timing of these introductions and announcements;\n\u2022variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, licenses, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and issuance of securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our future competitors;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates or guidance, including our ability to meet our future revenue and operating profit or loss estimates or guidance;\n\u2022sales of substantial amounts of our stock by insiders and large stockholders, or the expectation that such sales might occur;\n\u2022general economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u2022adverse tax laws or regulations enacted or existing laws applied to us or our customers;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022intellectual property, product liability or other litigation against us;\n\u2022expiration or termination of our potential relationships with customers and strategic partners;\n\u2022the occurrence of trade wars or barriers, or the perception that trade wars or barriers will occur;\n\u2022any buying or selling of shares of our common stock or other hedging transactions in our common stock in connection with the 2027 Notes or the capped call transactions;\n\u2022widespread public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nThese broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price or liquidity of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, stockholders have initiated class actions against pharmaceutical companies, including us, following periods of volatility in their stock prices. Such litigation instituted against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Securities and industry analysts may cease to publish research on our company at any time in their discretion. A lack of research coverage may adversely affect the liquidity and market price of our common stock. We will not have any control of the equity research analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of our company, or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales might occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. In November 2020, we entered into a sales agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC (\u201cCowen\u201d) as sales agent (the \u201c2020 ATM Agreement\u201d). Under the 2020 ATM Agreement, we may offer and sell, from time to time, through Cowen, shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to $125 million. As of December 31, 2021, we sold 3.3 million shares of common stock under the 2020 ATM Agreement resulting in net proceeds of $90.1 million after sales agent commissions, with $32.6 million remaining available under the 2020 ATM Agreement.\nIf our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. For instance, shares of our common stock that were issued to HintMD stockholders as consideration for the HintMD Acquisition, including those shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, are freely tradable without restrictions or further registration under the Securities Act, in some cases following the expiration of lock-up agreements entered into between Revance and HintMD directors and members of management and certain HintMD stockholders (the \u201cLock-Up Agreements\u201d). If former HintMD stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including following the expiration\nof the Lock-Up Agreements, the market price per share of our common stock may decline. Any sales of securities by stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment, and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a result.\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may make it difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change in control was considered favorable by you and other stockholders. For example, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Our board of directors can fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction. As a result, the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our stockholders may be adversely affected. An issuance of shares of preferred stock may result in the loss of voting control to other stockholders.\nOur charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, including:\n\u2022only one of our three classes of directors will be elected each year;\n\u2022no cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to issues shares of preferred stock and determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval;\n\u2022the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy or newly created directorship;\n\u2022stockholders will not be permitted to take actions by written consent;\n\u2022stockholders cannot call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors, by a majority vote, to amend the bylaws; and\n\u2022the requirement for the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3 percent or more of the outstanding common stock to amend many of the provisions described above.\nIn addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), which regulates corporate acquisitions. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock, including transactions that may be in your best interests. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management or limit the price that certain investors are willing to pay for our stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws and amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provide that the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, any state court located in Delaware or if all the state courts lack jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) and any appellate court therefrom will be the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\n\u2022any derivative action, suit or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company;\n\u2022any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, other employee or stockholder of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders or any action asserting a claim for aiding and abetting any such breach of fiduciary duty;\n\u2022any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim against the Company or any current or former director, officer, or other employee of the Company arising out of or pursuant to, or seeking to enforce any right, obligation or remedy under, or to interpret, apply, or determine the validity of, any provision of the DGCL, the amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or the amended and restated bylaws (as each may be amended from time to time);\n\u2022any action, suit, or proceeding as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Delaware Court of Chancery, and\n\u2022any action, suit or proceeding asserting a claim against the Company or any current or former director, officer, or other employee of the Company governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to actions, suits or proceedings brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any claims arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The exclusive forum provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find the exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.\nIn addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, our amended and restated bylaws and our indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and officers provide that:\n\u2022We will indemnify our directors and officers for serving us in those capacities, or for serving other business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person\u2019s conduct was unlawful.\n\u2022We may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law.\n\u2022We are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.\n\u2022We will not be obligated pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws to indemnify a person with respect to proceedings initiated by that person against us or our other indemnitees, except with respect to proceedings authorized by our board of directors or brought to enforce a right to indemnification.\n\u2022The rights conferred in our amended and restated bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons.\n\u2022We may not retroactively amend our amended and restated bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees and agents.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gains.\nWe have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock to date. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of any existing or future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 14467, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "RVNC"}
