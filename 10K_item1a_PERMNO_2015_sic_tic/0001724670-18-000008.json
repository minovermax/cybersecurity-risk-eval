{"cik": "1724670", "company": "Perspecta Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-06-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider all of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and each of the risks described below, which we believe are the principal risks that we face. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below are not the only risks that Perspecta currently faces.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe depend on contracts with the U.S. government and its contractors for most of our revenue. If our relationships with such agencies are harmed, our future revenue and operating profits could materially decline.\nThe government, at the U.S. federal, state and local levels, is our primary customer, with revenue from U.S. government contracts, either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor, accounting for substantially all of our revenue for the year ended March 31, 2018. We believe the future growth of our business will continue to depend primarily on our ability to be awarded work under U.S. government contracts, as we expect this will be the primary source of substantially all of our revenue in the foreseeable future.\nFor this reason, any issue that compromises our relationship with the U.S. government generally or any U.S. government agency that we serve could cause our revenue to materially decline. Among the key factors in maintaining our relationship with U.S. government agencies are our performance on contracts, the strength of our professional reputation, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and the strength of our relationships with customer personnel. In addition, the mishandling or the perception of mishandling of sensitive information, such as our failure to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive information associated with the work we perform for our customers, or even the existence of our business relationships with certain of our customers, including as a result of misconduct or other improper activities by our employees or subcontractors, or a failure to maintain adequate protection against security breaches, including those resulting from cyber-attack, could harm our relationship with U.S. government agencies. Our relationship with the U.S.\ngovernment could also be damaged as a result of an agency\u2019s dissatisfaction with work performed by us, a subcontractor, or other third parties that provide services or products for a specific project for any reason, including due to perceived or actual deficiencies in the performance or quality of our work. In such case, we may incur additional costs to address any such situation and the profitability of that work might be impaired. In addition, to the extent our performance under a contract does not meet a U.S. government agency\u2019s expectations, such agency customer may seek to terminate the contract prior to its scheduled expiration date, provide a negative assessment of our performance to government-maintained contractor past-performance repositories, fail to award us additional business under existing contracts or otherwise, and direct future business to our competitors. Further, negative publicity concerning government contractors in general or us in particular may harm our reputation with U.S. government contractors. To the extent our reputation or relationships with U.S. government agencies is impaired, our revenue and operating profits could materially decline.\nU.S. government spending and mission priorities could change in a manner that adversely affects our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is generated from contracts with the U.S. government and its agencies. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be adversely affected by several causes, including:\n\u2022\nbudgetary constraints, including Congressionally-mandated automatic spending cuts, affecting U.S. federal government spending generally, or specific agencies in particular, and changes in available funding;\n\u2022\na shift in expenditures away from agencies or programs that we support, including a shift in the focus of government research programs to short-term activities that are more urgent, thus reducing funding for forward-looking research;\n\u2022\nU.S. government shutdowns due to a failure by elected officials to fund the government (such as the federal government shutdown in 2013 and the recent shutdown in January 2018, which could occur again), or weather-related closures in the Washington, D.C. area (such as that which occurred in the winter of 2016) and other potential delays in the appropriations process;\n\u2022\nreduced U.S. federal government outsourcing of functions that we are currently contracted to provide, including as a result of increased insourcing by various U.S. federal government agencies due to changes in the definition of \u201cinherently governmental\u201d work, including proposals to limit contractor access to sensitive or classified information and work assignments;\n\u2022\nfurther efforts to improve efficiency and reduce costs affecting government programs;\n\u2022\nchanges in government programs that we support or related requirements;\n\u2022\na continuation of recent efforts by the federal government to decrease spending for management support service contracts;\n\u2022\ngovernment agencies awarding contracts on a technically-acceptable/lowest-cost basis to reduce expenditures;\n\u2022\ndelays in the payment of our invoices by government payment offices;\n\u2022\nan inability by the federal government to fund its operations as a result of a failure to increase the federal government\u2019s debt ceiling, a credit downgrade of U.S. government obligations or for any other reason; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the political climate and general economic conditions, including a slowdown of the economy or unstable economic conditions and responses to conditions, such as emergency spending, that reduce funds available for other government priorities.\nIn addition, any disruption in the functioning of U.S. government agencies, including as a result of U.S. government closures and shutdowns, terrorism, war, natural disasters, destruction of or damage to U.S. government facilities, and other potential calamities could have a negative impact on our operations and cause us to lose revenue or incur additional costs due to, among other things, our inability to deploy our staff to customer locations or facilities as a result of such disruptions.\nFurther, a significant portion of our business depends upon continued U.S. federal government expenditures on intelligence, defense, space and federal civilian programs for which we provide support. These expenditures have not remained constant over time, have been reduced in certain periods and, recently, have been affected by the U.S. federal government\u2019s efforts to improve efficiency and reduce costs affecting U.S. federal government programs generally.\nThe U.S. federal government budget deficits, the national debt, and the prevailing economic condition, and actions taken to address them, could continue to negatively affect U.S. federal government expenditures on intelligence, defense, space and federal civilian programs for which we provide support. In particular, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (as amended by\nthe American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018) provides for automatic spending cuts (referred to as sequestration) totaling approximately $1.2 trillion between 2013 and 2021, including an estimated $500 billion in federal defense spending cuts over this time period. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 set spending limits for the U.S. fiscal year 2017 budget across the U.S. federal government and increased the prior discretionary spending caps in both defense and non-defense. While recent budget actions reflect a more measured and strategic approach to addressing the federal government\u2019s fiscal challenges, there remains uncertainty as to how exactly budget cuts, including sequestration, could impact us, and we are therefore unable to predict the extent of the impact of such cuts on our business, results of operations and prospects. In addition, in response to an Office of Management and Budget mandate, U.S. federal government agencies have reduced management support services spending in recent years. If federal awards for management support services continue to decline, our revenue and operating profits may materially decline and further efforts by the Office of Management and Budget to decrease federal awards for management support services could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects.\nThese or other factors could cause our intelligence, defense and federal civilian customers to decrease the number or value of new contracts awarded generally and fail to award us new contracts, reduce their purchases under our existing contracts, exercise their right to terminate our contracts, or not exercise options to renew our contracts, any of which could cause a material decline in our revenue.\nA delay in the completion of the U.S. federal government\u2019s budget process could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results.\nOn an annual basis, the U.S. Congress must approve budgets that govern spending by each of the federal agencies we support. When the U.S. Congress is unable to agree on budget priorities, and thus is unable to pass the annual budget on a timely basis, the U.S. Congress typically enacts a continuing resolution. A continuing resolution allows U.S. federal government agencies to operate at spending levels approved in the previous budget cycle. Under a continuing resolution, funding may not be available for new projects. In addition, when U.S. federal government agencies operate on the basis of a continuing resolution, they may delay funding we expect to receive on contracts we are already performing. Any such delays would likely result in new business initiatives being delayed or canceled and could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results. Furthermore, a failure to complete the budget process and fund government operations pursuant to a continuing resolution may result in a U.S. federal government shutdown, such as the recent shutdown in January 2018. Finally, while the U.S. Congress may pass a continuing resolution, similar to the continuing resolution passed in January 2018, it is possible no agreement on the annual budget may be reached and the U.S. government could shut down again following the expiration of the continuing resolution that acted largely as a stopgap measure. A shut down may result in us incurring substantial costs without reimbursement under our contracts and the delay or cancellation of key programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results.\nWe are subject to a number of laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to procurement and anti-bribery laws. Our business and reputation could be adversely affected if we fail to comply with these laws.\nWe must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and impose certain risks and costs on our business. U.S. government contractors are subject to a greater risk of investigation, criminal prosecution, civil fraud, whistleblower lawsuits and other legal actions and liabilities than companies with solely commercial customers. A violation of specific laws and regulations, by us, our employees, others working on our behalf, a supplier or a venture partner, could harm our reputation and result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of our contracts, suspension or debarment from bidding on or being awarded contracts, loss of our ability to export products or services and civil or criminal investigations or proceedings. In some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are different from those typically found in commercial transactions. For example, the U.S. federal government may terminate any of our government contracts and subcontracts either at its convenience or for default based on our performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process and an allowance for profit on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss.\nUpon termination for convenience of a cost-reimbursable contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee. Allowable costs would include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to\ntermination and is determined by negotiation. We attempt to ensure that adequate funds are available by notifying the customer when its estimated costs, including those associated with a possible termination for convenience, approach levels specified as being allotted to its programs. As funds are typically appropriated on a fiscal-year basis and as the costs of a termination for convenience may exceed the costs of continuing a program in a given fiscal year, occasionally programs do not have sufficient funds appropriated to cover the termination costs were the U.S. federal government to terminate them for convenience. Under such circumstances, the U.S. federal government could assert that it is not required to appropriate additional funding.\nA termination arising out of our default may expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor, the U.S. federal government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, notwithstanding the quality of our services as a subcontractor. In the case of termination for default, the U.S. federal government could make claims to reduce the contract value or recover its procurement costs and could assess other special penalties. However, under such circumstances we have rights and access to remedial actions under laws and the FAR.\nU.S. federal government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency (\"DCAA\"), the Defense Contract Management Agency (\"DCMA\") and various agency Inspectors General, routinely audit and investigate government contractors. These agencies review a contractor\u2019s performance under its contracts, its cost structure, its business systems, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The U.S. federal government has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate. Additionally, any costs found to be misclassified may be subject to repayment. We have unaudited and/or unsettled incurred cost claims related to past years, which places risk on our ability to issue final billings on contracts for which authorized and appropriated funds may be expiring. If an audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or terminations, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, penalties, fines and suspension, or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. In addition, we could incur significant legal costs and suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Similar government oversight exists in most other countries where we conduct business.\nWe are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (\u201cFCPA\u201d), and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions. We pursue opportunities in certain parts of the world that experience government corruption and, in certain circumstances, compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our internal policies mandate compliance with all applicable anti-bribery laws. We require our employees, partners, subcontractors, agents, and others to comply with the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws. Our policies or procedures may not protect us against liability under the FCPA or other laws for actions taken by our employees and intermediaries. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations (either due to our own acts or our omissions, or due to the acts or omissions of others), we could suffer from severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations of the FCPA or other anti-bribery violations is expensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management.\nThe U.S. government\u2019s organizational conflict of interest rules could limit our ability to successfully compete for new contracts or task orders or may require us to exit or wind down certain existing contracts or task orders, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and prospects.\nPast efforts by the U.S. government to reform its procurement practices have focused, among other areas, on the separation of certain types of work to facilitate objectivity and avoid or mitigate organizational conflicts of interest, and the strengthening of regulations governing organizational conflicts of interest. Organizational conflicts of interest may arise from circumstances in which a contractor has:\n\u2022\nimpaired objectivity during performance;\n\u2022\nunfair access to non-public information; or\n\u2022\nthe ability to set the \u201cground rules\u201d for another procurement for which the contractor competes.\nA focus on organizational conflicts of interest issues has resulted in legislation and regulations aimed at increasing organizational conflicts of interest requirements, including, among other things, separating sellers of products and\nproviders of advisory services in major defense acquisition programs. These organizational conflicts of interest regulations have led to increased bid protests related to arguments to disqualify or overturn awards based on conflict grounds.\nFuture legislation and regulations may increase the restrictions in current organizational conflicts of interest regulations and rules. In addition, the Mergers may create organizational conflict of interest issues that may require remediation, including potentially exiting one or more existing contracts or winding down certain existing contracts or task orders. To the extent that organizational conflicts of interest laws, regulations and rules limit our ability to successfully compete for new contracts or task orders with the U.S. government and/or commercial entities, or require us to exit certain existing contracts or task orders or winding down certain existing contracts or task orders, either because of organizational conflicts of interest issues arising from our business or because companies with which we are affiliated or with which we otherwise conduct business create organizational conflicts of interest issues for us, our results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may fail to obtain and maintain necessary security clearances or certifications, which may adversely affect our ability to perform on certain contracts.\nMany U.S. government programs require contractor employees and facilities to have security clearances or certifications. Depending on the level of required clearance, security clearances and certifications can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we, our employees or prospective employees or facilities are unable to obtain or retain necessary security clearances or certifications, we may not be able to bid on, win or perform on new contracts, or effectively compete for expiring contracts, and we may lose existing contracts, which may adversely affect our operating results and inhibit the execution of our growth strategy.\nWe derive a majority of our revenue from contracts awarded through a competitive bidding process, and our revenue and profitability may be materially adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively in the process.\nWe derive a majority of our revenue from U.S. government contracts awarded through competitive bidding processes including through competitions for orders under multiple award contracts. We do not expect this to change for the foreseeable future. Our failure to compete effectively in this procurement environment would have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. In addition, our current contracts are re-competed from time to time, and we are not assured of winning these re-competes. In circumstances where we do not win those re-competes, and those lost contracts are not replaced, our operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe competitive bidding process involves risk and significant costs to businesses operating in this environment, including:\n\u2022\nthe necessity to expend resources, make financial commitments (such as procuring leased premises) and bid on engagements in advance of the completion of their design, which may result in unforeseen difficulties in execution and cost overruns;\n\u2022\nthe substantial cost and managerial time and effort spent to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us;\n\u2022\nthe ability to accurately estimate the resources and costs that will be required to service any contract we are awarded;\n\u2022\nthe expense and delay that may arise if our competitors protest or challenge contract awards made to us pursuant to competitive bidding, and the risk that any such protest or challenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in termination, reduction, or modification of the awarded contract; and\n\u2022\nany opportunity cost of bidding and winning other contracts we might otherwise pursue.\nIn circumstances where contracts are held by other companies and are scheduled to expire, we still may not be provided the opportunity to bid on those contracts if the government extends the existing contract. If we are unable to win particular contracts that are awarded through the competitive bidding process, we may not be able to operate in the market for services that are provided under those contracts for the duration of those contracts to the extent that there is no additional demand for such services. In addition, if the government elects to use a contract vehicle that we do not hold, we will not be able to compete for work under that contract vehicle as a prime contractor. An inability to consistently win new contract awards or compete for work as a prime contractor over any extended period could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects.\nOur earnings and profitability may vary based on the mix of our contracts and may be adversely affected by our failure to accurately estimate or otherwise recover the expenses, time, and resources for our contracts.\nWe enter into several different types of contracts with our government customers for our services including cost-reimbursable, time-and-materials, and fixed-price. Each of these types of contracts, to varying degrees, involves the risk that we could underestimate our cost of fulfilling the contract, which may reduce the profit we earn or lead to a financial loss on the contract and adversely affect our operating results.\nUnder cost-reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs up to a ceiling and paid a fee, which may be fixed or performance-based. If our actual costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the terms of the contract or applicable regulations, we may not be able to recover those costs. In particular, there is increasing focus by the U.S. government on the extent to which government contractors, including us, are able to receive reimbursement for employee compensation, including rules under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 that substantially decreased the level of allowable compensation cost for executive-level employees and further applied the newly reduced limitation to all employees. In addition, there is risk of compensation being deemed unallowable or payments being withheld as a result of government audit, review, or investigation.\nUnder time-and-materials contracts, we are reimbursed for the hours worked using predetermined hourly rates for each labor category, and typically reimbursed for other direct contract costs and expenses at cost. We assume financial risk on time-and-materials contracts because our cost of performance may exceed these negotiated hourly rates.\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we perform specific tasks for a pre-determined price. Compared to time-and-materials and cost-reimbursable contracts, fixed-price contracts generally offer higher margin opportunities because we receive the benefits of any cost savings, but involve greater financial risk because we bear the impact of any cost overruns. Because we assume the risk for cost overruns and contingent losses on fixed-price contracts, an increase in the percentage of fixed-price contracts in our contract mix could increase our risk of suffering losses. In addition, the government procurement policies have focused on requiring disclosure of cost and pricing data in the context of fixed-price contracting, which can impact the profitability of those contracts.\nAdditionally, our profits could be adversely affected if our costs under any of these contracts exceed the assumptions we used in bidding for the contract. For example, we may miscalculate the costs, resources, or time needed to complete projects or meet contractual milestones as a result of delays on a particular project, including delays in designs, engineering information, or materials provided by the customer or a third party, delays or difficulties in equipment and material delivery, schedule changes, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nWe have recorded provisions in our consolidated financial statements for losses on our contracts, as required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), but our contract loss provisions may not be adequate to cover all actual losses that we may incur in the future. Actual losses could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nMany of our contracts contain provisions that require innovative design capabilities, are technologically complex or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control. Failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nWe design and develop technologically advanced and innovative products and services applied by our customers in a variety of environments. Problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design, technology, licensing and patent rights, labor, learning curve assumptions or materials and components could prevent us from achieving contractual requirements.\nIn addition, our offerings cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenue and profitability such as problems with quality and workmanship, country of origin, delivery of subcontractor components or services and unplanned degradation of product performance. Among the factors that may adversely affect revenue and profits could be unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer, diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems, loss of follow-on work, and, in the case of certain contracts, repayment to the U.S. government customer of contract cost and fee payments we previously received.\nFailure of third parties to deliver on commitments under contracts and misconduct of employees, subcontractors, agents and business partners could cause us to lose existing contracts or customers and adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts and customers and could have a significant adverse impact on our business and reputation.\nOur contracts are expected to be complex and, in some instances, may require us to partner with other parties, including software and hardware vendors, to provide the complex solutions required by our customers. Our ability to deliver the solutions and provide the services required by our customers will be dependent on our abilities and our partners to meet customers\u2019 delivery schedules. If we or our partners fail to deliver services or products on time, our ability to complete the contract may be adversely affected, which may have a material and adverse impact on our revenue and profitability.\nMisconduct could include fraud or other improper activities such as falsifying time or other records and violations of laws and regulations, including the Procurement Integrity Act and anti-corruption laws. Other examples could include the failure to comply with our code of business conduct and ethics (The Standard), policies and procedures or with U.S. federal, state or local government procurement regulations, rules regarding the use and safeguarding of classified or other protected information, legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, laws and regulations relating to environmental, health or safety matters, international trade controls (particularly the International Traffic in Arms Regulations), lobbying or similar activities and any other applicable laws or regulations. Any data loss or information security lapses resulting in the compromise of personal information or the improper use or disclosure of sensitive or classified information could result in claims, remediation costs, regulatory sanctions against us, loss of current and future contracts and serious harm to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies, procedures and controls to prevent and detect these activities, these precautions may not prevent all misconduct and, as a result, we could face unknown risks or losses. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or misconduct by any of our employees, subcontractors, agents or business partners could damage our reputation and subject us to fines and penalties, restitution or other damages, loss of security clearance, loss of current and future customer contracts and suspension or debarment from contracting with U.S. federal, state or local government agencies, any of which would adversely affect our business and our future results.\nOur business could be adversely affected if there are delays, terminations or cancellations caused by our competitors protesting major contract awards received by us or there are adverse protest decisions in contracts awarded to us.\nU.S. government contracts are frequently subject to bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards. It can take many months for the relevant U.S. government agency to resolve protests by one or more of our competitors of contract awards we receive. Bid protests may result in significant expense to us, and termination or cancellation of an awarded contract as a result of the award being overturned. Even if we do not lose the awarded contract, the resulting delay in the startup and funding of the work under these contracts may cause our revenue and profitability to be materially and adversely affected.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting may not be able to detect fraud or other issues.\nWe will be required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to include a report of management on our internal controls that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, the public accounting firm auditing our financial statements will be required to report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. However, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. We may not detect all control issues or fraud. In connection with the Mergers, and as we continue to grow our business, our internal controls continue to become more complex and require more resources.\nWe may earn less revenue than projected, or no revenue, under certain of our contracts.\nSome of our contracts with our clients are ID/IQ contracts. ID/IQ contracts provide for the issuance by the client of orders for services or products under the contract, and often contain multi-year terms and unfunded ceiling amounts, which allow but do not commit our U.S. government customer to purchase products and services from contractors. Our ability to generate revenue under each of these types of contracts depends upon our ability to be awarded task orders for specific\nservices by the client. ID/IQ contracts may be awarded to one contractor (single award) or several contractors (multiple award). Multiple contractors must compete under multiple award ID/IQ contracts for task orders to provide particular services, and contractors earn revenue only to the extent that they successfully compete for these task orders. A failure to be awarded task orders under such contracts would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our ability to maintain our existing business and win new business depends on our ability to maintain our prime and subcontractor positions on our ID/IQ contracts.\nA termination of our defined benefit pension plan would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn connection with the Mergers, Perspecta assumed unfunded pension obligations related to Vencore HC's defined benefit pension plan. As of December 31, 2017, these obligations would have amounted to approximately $94 million. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the \u201cPBGC\u201d) has authority under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, to terminate an underfunded defined benefit pension plan under certain circumstances, including when (1) the plan has not met the minimum funding requirements, (2) the plan cannot pay current benefits when due, or (3) the loss to the PBGC is reasonably expected to increase unreasonably over time if the plan is not terminated. If the PBGC were to terminate our U.S. defined benefit pension plan, our obligations with respect to such plan would become due and payable in full. Any such event or the failure by us to pay our pension plan insurance premiums with respect to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan could result in the PBGC obtaining a lien on our assets. Such an event would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. government may revise its procurement, contract or other practices in a manner materially adverse to us at any time.\nOur industry continues to experience significant changes to business practices as a result of an increased focus on affordability, efficiencies and recovery of costs, among other items. Legislation, regulations and initiatives dealing with procurement reform, mitigation of potential organizational conflicts of interest, deterrence of fraud, and environmental responsibility or sustainability could have a material adverse effect on us. Moreover, shifts in the buying practices of government agencies (such as increased usage of fixed-price contracts with disclosure of cost and pricing data, multiple award contracts and small business set-aside contracts) could have material adverse effects on government contractors, including us. The government may:\n\u2022\nrevise its procurement practices or adopt new contract laws, rules, and regulations, such as cost accounting standards, organizational conflicts of interest, and other rules governing inherently governmental functions at any time;\n\u2022\nreduce, delay, or cancel procurement programs resulting from government efforts to improve procurement practices and efficiency;\n\u2022\nlimit the creation of new government-wide or agency-specific multiple award contracts;\n\u2022\nface restrictions or pressure from government employees and their unions regarding the amount of services the U.S. federal, state or local governments may obtain from private contractors;\n\u2022\naward contracts on a technically acceptable/lowest-cost basis to reduce expenditures, and we may not be the lowest-cost provider of services;\n\u2022\n\u2022\nadopt new socio-economic requirements, including setting aside procurement opportunities for small, disadvantaged, minority-, women- or veteran-owned businesses;\n\u2022\nchange the basis upon which it reimburses our compensation and other expenses or otherwise limit such reimbursements; and\n\u2022\nat its option, terminate or decline to renew our contracts.\nIn addition, any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement and could materially adversely affect our future revenue and profit margin. Furthermore, changes to the procurement system could cause delays in the procurement decision-making process. Any such changes to the government\u2019s procurement practices or the adoption of new contracting rules or practices could impair our ability to obtain new or re-compete contracts and any such changes or increased associated costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Moreover, cost-cutting initiatives announced by the U.S. federal government may significantly change the way the U.S. federal government solicits, negotiates, and manages its contracts, which could result in an increase in competitive pressure and decreased profitability on contracts and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe U.S. federal government may prefer small, disadvantaged, minority-, women- or veteran-owned businesses. As a result, we may have fewer opportunities to bid on new or incumbent work.\nAs a result of Small Business Administration set-aside and preference programs, the U.S. federal government may decide to restrict certain procurements only to bidders that qualify as small, disadvantaged, minority-, women- or veteran-owned. As a result, we would not be eligible to perform as a prime contractor on those programs and would be restricted as to the work we could perform as a subcontractor on those programs. An increase in the amount of procurements under the Small Business Administration set-aside program may impact our ability to bid on new procurements as a prime contractor or restrict our ability to re-compete on incumbent work that is placed in the set-aside program.\nOur business is subject to reviews, audits and cost adjustments by the U.S. federal government, which, if resolved unfavorably to us, could adversely affect our profitability, cash flows or growth prospects.\nThe DCAA, DCMA and others routinely audit and review a contractor\u2019s performance on government contracts, indirect cost rates and pricing practices, and compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards. They also review the adequacy of the contractor\u2019s compliance with government standards for its business systems, which are defined as the contractor\u2019s accounting, earned value management, estimating, materials management, property management and purchasing systems. A finding of material weakness or significant control deficiencies in a contractor\u2019s business systems or a finding of noncompliance with the FAR or Cost Accounting Standards can result in reduced billing rates to U.S. government customers until the material weakness or control deficiencies are corrected and their remediation is accepted by the DCMA. The agencies conducting these audits and reviews have come under increased scrutiny. As a result, audits and reviews have become more rigorous and the standards to which we are held are being more strictly interpreted which has increased the likelihood of an audit or review resulting in an adverse outcome.\nGovernment audits and reviews may conclude that our practices are not consistent with applicable laws and regulations and result in adjustments to contract costs and mandatory customer refunds. Further, we currently intend to integrate the USPS and Vencore business systems, and as a result, any finding of noncompliance in either legacy company's business system could result in a negative impact for the combined entity. Such adjustments, whether to USPS, Vencore, or to the combined entity, can be applied retroactively, which could result in significant customer refunds. Receipt of adverse audit findings or the failure to obtain an \u201capproved\u201d determination on our various business systems could significantly and adversely affect our business by, among other things, restricting our ability to bid on new contracts and, for those proposals under evaluation, diminishing our competitive position. A determination of noncompliance in our business systems could also result in the U.S. federal government imposing penalties and sanctions against us, including withholding of payments, suspension of payments and increased government scrutiny. Increased scrutiny could adversely impact our ability to perform on contracts, affect our ability to invoice for work performed, delay the receipt of timely payment on contracts, and weaken our ability to compete for new contracts with the U.S. federal government.\nIf we cannot collect our receivables or if payment is delayed, our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend on the timely collection of our receivables to generate cash flow, provide working capital, and continue our business operations. Over the course of a long-term contract, a customer\u2019s financial condition may decline and lower its ability to pay its obligations. This would cause our cash collections to decrease and bad debt expense to increase. While we may resort to alternative methods to pursue claims or collect receivables, these methods are expensive and time consuming and successful collection is not guaranteed. Failure to collect our receivables or prevail on claims would have an adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows.\nU.S. federal, state or local governments may delay or fail to pay invoices for a number of reasons, including lack of appropriated funds, lack of an approved budget, or as a result of audit findings by government regulatory agencies. Some prime contractors for whom we are a subcontractor have significantly fewer financial resources than we do, which may increase the risk that we may not be paid in full or that payment may be delayed.\nOur U.S. federal, state and local government contracts may be terminated by such U.S. federal, state or local government customer at any time and may contain other provisions permitting such customer to discontinue contract performance, allow a contract to expire, or that are otherwise unfavorable to us (e.g., the federal\ngovernment\u2019s decision not to renew an option), and if discontinued contracts are not replaced, our operating results may differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.\nU.S. federal, state and local government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that provide those government customers with rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts. These rights and remedies allow government customers to, among other things:\n\u2022\nterminate existing contracts, with short notice, for convenience as well as for default;\n\u2022\nreduce orders under or otherwise modify contracts;\n\u2022\nfor contracts subject to the Truth in Negotiations Act, reduce the contract price or cost where it was increased because a contractor or subcontractor furnished cost or pricing data during negotiations that was not complete, accurate, and current;\n\u2022\nfor some contracts, demand a refund, make a forward price adjustment, or terminate a contract for default if a contractor provided inaccurate or incomplete data during the contract negotiation process and/or reduce the contract price under certain triggering circumstances, including the revision of price lists or other documents upon which the contract award was predicated;\n\u2022\nterminate our facility security clearances and thereby prevent us from receiving classified contracts;\n\u2022\ncancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;\n\u2022\ndecline to exercise an option to renew a multi-year contract or issue task orders in connection with ID/IQ contracts;\n\u2022\nassert rights in solutions, systems, and technology produced by us during contract performance, and continue to use that work product without continuing to contract for our services, and/or disclose or permit such work product to be used by third parties, including other U.S. government agencies and our competitors, which could harm our competitive position;\n\u2022\n\u2022\nprohibit future procurement awards with a particular U.S. federal government agency due to a finding of organizational conflicts of interest based upon prior related work performed for the U.S. federal government agency that would give a contractor an unfair advantage over competing contractors, or the existence of conflicting roles that might bias a contractor\u2019s judgment;\n\u2022\nsuspend or debar us from doing business with the U.S. federal government;\n\u2022\nimpose fines and penalties on us, and subject us to criminal prosecution;\n\u2022\nrepurpose funds to address rated orders;\n\u2022\ncontrol or prohibit the export of our services; and\n\u2022\nimpose special handling and control requirements for controlled information.\nRecent and potential future budget cuts, the impact of sequestration and recent efforts by the Office of Management and Budget to decrease federal awards for management support services may cause U.S. federal government agencies with which we currently have contracts to terminate, reduce the number of task orders under, or fail to renew such contracts. If a government customer were to unexpectedly terminate, cancel, or decline to exercise an option to renew with respect to one or more of our significant contracts, or suspend or debar us from doing business with such government customer, our revenue and operating results could be materially harmed.\nOur business is subject to fluctuations that may cause our operating results to decline.\nThe U.S. federal government's fiscal year ends on September 30th of each year. It is not uncommon for U.S. federal government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the weeks before the end of its fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds. We have historically experienced increased bid and proposal costs in the months leading up to the U.S. federal government's fiscal year end as we pursue new contract opportunities being shortly before the U.S. federal government fiscal year end. We also experience some seasonality effects from the timing of the fiscal year end close for state and local governments, which in many instances are different than the U.S. federal government fiscal year end. In general, we tend to experience an increase in revenue in the first half of the calendar year from our state and local government customers as that is when funds are generally allocated to specific projects. Finally, we also tend to generate less revenue and profit from our labor services during our third quarter as a result of higher leave-taking during the holiday season. We may continue to experience this seasonality in future periods, and our results of operations may be affected by it. While not certain, changes in the U.S. federal government\u2019s funding and spending patterns have altered historical seasonality trends, supporting our approach to managing the business on\nan annual basis. Seasonality is just one of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, which may negatively affect our operating results in any period.\nOur ability to provide customers with competitive services is dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including our senior management team.\nOur ability to grow and provide our customers with competitive services is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly motivated people with the skills necessary to serve our customers. The markets we serve are highly competitive and competition for skilled employees in the technology outsourcing, consulting, and systems integration and enterprise services markets is intense. Personnel with the requisite skills, qualifications, or security clearance may be in short supply or generally unavailable. The loss of personnel could impair our ability to perform under certain contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, prospects and cash flows.\nIn addition, due to the Mergers, uncertainty around future employment opportunities, facility locations, organizational and reporting structures, and other related concerns may impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. If employee attrition is higher than expected due to difficulties encountered in the integration process it may adversely impact our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Mergers.\nIf we do not hire, train, motivate, and effectively utilize employees with the right mix of skills and experience in the right geographic regions and for the right offerings to meet the needs of our customers, our financial performance could suffer. For example, if our employee utilization rate is too low, our profitability, and the level of engagement of our employees could decrease. If that utilization rate is too high, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition and the quality of the work performed, as well as our ability to staff projects. If we are unable to hire and retain enough employees with the skills or backgrounds needed to meet current demand, we may need to redeploy existing personnel, increase our reliance on subcontractors or increase employee compensation levels, all of which could also negatively affect our profitability. We may also incur increased costs if we have more employees than necessary with certain skill sets or in certain geographies as we will need to rebalance our supply of skills and resources with customer demand in those geographies.\nIn addition to attracting and retaining qualified technical personnel, we believe that our success will depend on the continued employment of our senior management team and our ability to generate new business and execute projects successfully. Our senior management team is very important to our business because personal reputations and individual business relationships are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining customer engagements in our industry, particularly with agencies performing classified operations. The loss of any of our senior executives could cause us to lose customer relationships or new business opportunities, which could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.\nOur business and financial results could be negatively affected by cyber-attack, service interruptions or other security threats.\nAs a provider of IT services to U.S. public sector customers, we store and process large amounts of sensitive information which includes personally identifiable information, protected health information, personnel information, classified information, financial information and other confidential information concerning our business and employees and those of our customers (collectively referred to as \u201csensitive information\u201d). We are continuously exposed to risk from cyber-attack and other security threats, including computer viruses and attacks by hackers. Any electronic or other security breach or compromise may jeopardize security of sensitive information stored or transmitted through our IT systems and networks, and could expose us to regulatory scrutiny, actions and penalties, extensive contractual liability litigation, reputational harm, and a loss of customer confidence, which could potentially have an adverse impact on future business with current and potential customers.\nExperienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our sensitive information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of these products. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications produced or procured from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the\noperation of the system. The costs to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, including bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs, and other security vulnerabilities, could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers, which may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions.\nWe work with other companies in the industry and government participants to share threat intelligence and promote increased awareness and enhanced protections against cybersecurity threats, and we seek to detect and investigate all security events and to prevent their occurrence or recurrence. We continue to improve our threat protection, detection and mitigation policies, procedures and controls. Our security measures are designed to identify and protect against security breaches and cyber-attack. However, our failure to detect, prevent or adequately respond to a future threat incident could subject us to liability and reputational damage and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIncreasing data privacy and information security obligations could also impose additional regulatory pressures on our customers\u2019 businesses and, indirectly, on our operations. In response, some of our customers have sought and may continue to seek, to contractually impose certain strict data privacy and information security obligations on us. Under certain of our customer contracts we are specifically tasked with cybersecurity measures and thus are affirmatively responsible for implementing cybersecurity measures to protect against, detect and mitigate these threats. Some of our customer contracts may not limit our liability for the loss of sensitive information. If we are unable to adequately address these concerns, our business, results of operations and prospects could suffer. Compliance with new privacy and security laws, requirements and regulations, where required or undertaken by us, may result in cost increases due to potential systems changes, the development of additional administrative processes and increased enforcement actions, fines and penalties. While we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations as well as internal privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply or any misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information may result in proceedings or actions against us by government or other entities, private lawsuits against us (including class actions) or the loss of customers, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations and prospects.\nOur ability to expand our business beyond U.S. federal and certain state and local government customers may be constrained.\nThe SDA includes non-compete provisions pursuant to which we and DXC generally agree to not compete in certain customer, product and service categories for two years following the Distribution, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the SDA. Additionally, the IPMA provides us with a perpetual, royalty-free license to use certain DXC IP, which is restricted to use solely in connection with U.S. government and certain state and local government customers, and will be exclusive with respect to the federal government market for a period of five years, and non-exclusive with respect to certain U.S. state and local government customers. The Non-U.S. Agency Agreement between DXC and us appoints DXC as our exclusive agent outside the United States for certain non-U.S. government customers, excepting certain U.S. government contracts, for a period of five years. While we have no current plans to expand our existing business in ways that would require us to engage in business beyond the scope of the rights to IP we currently have, we are unable to engage in business activities outside the scope of that license until the expiration of those restrictions unless we develop or acquire new IP. The foregoing restrictions may limit our ability to engage in certain activities, may potentially lead to disputes, and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are defendants in pending litigation that may have a material and adverse impact on our profitability and liquidity.\nWe are party to a number of disputes that involve or may involve litigation. We also may become a party to a variety of lawsuits or claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. We are not able to predict the ultimate outcome of these disputes or the actual impact of these matters on our profitability. If we agree to settle these matters or judgments are secured against us, we may incur liabilities that may have a material and adverse impact on our liquidity and earnings. See Note 13 - \"Litigation and Contingencies\" to the Combined Financial Statements.\nOur business and operations expose us to numerous legal and regulatory requirements, and any violation of these requirements could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state and foreign legal requirements on matters as diverse as data privacy and protection, employment and labor relations, environmental, health and safety, immigration, taxation, anti-corruption, import/export controls, trade restrictions, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation and anti-competition. Compliance with diverse and changing legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources. We also conduct business in certain identified growth areas, such as national security, national intelligence, health IT and energy, which are highly regulated and may expose us to increased compliance risk. Violations of one or more of these diverse legal requirements in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines and other damages, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business (including suspension or debarment from government contracts or grants) and damage to our reputation. Violations of these regulations or contractual obligations related to regulatory compliance in connection with the performance of customer contracts could also result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage, restrictions on our ability to compete for certain work and allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations.\nIn the course of providing services to customers, we may inadvertently infringe on the IP rights of others and be exposed to claims for damages.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation involving IP rights in technology industries. The solutions we provide to our customers may inadvertently infringe on the IP rights of third parties resulting in claims for damages against us or our customers.\nAny infringement, misappropriation or related claims, whether or not meritorious, are time consuming, divert technical and management personnel and are costly to resolve. As a result of any such dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, pay damages, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, cease utilizing certain products or services or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to prevail in the litigation or retain or obtain sufficient rights or develop non-infringing IP or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely or cost-efficient basis, our business and operating results may be adversely affected. Additionally, the publicity resulting from infringing IP rights may damage our reputation and adversely impact our ability to develop new business.\nIn addition, U.S. government contracts typically contain provisions that allow the U.S. government to claim rights, including IP rights, in products and data developed and/or delivered under such agreements. We may not have the right to prohibit the U.S. government from using or disclosing certain technologies developed by us, and we may not be able to prohibit third party companies, including our competitors, from using those technologies commercially or in providing products and services to the U.S. government. The U.S. government generally takes the position that it has an unlimited right to royalty-free use of technologies that are developed under U.S. government contracts.\nWe have substantial indebtedness following the Spin-Off and Mergers, and the ability to incur significant additional indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFollowing the Spin-Off and the Mergers, we have substantial indebtedness and may increase our indebtedness in the future. Following the completion of the Spin-Off and the Mergers on May 31, 2018, our total indebtedness, excluding capital leases, was approximately $2.6 billion. In addition, Enterprise Services LLC (\"ES LLC\"), a subsidiary of Perspecta, retained contractual capitalized lease obligations with an aggregate outstanding balance of up to $300 million, net of cash payments from DXC. Further, $66 million in principal amount of EDS Notes (as defined under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - EDS Notes\u201d) remain outstanding at ES LLC after the completion of the Spin-Off and Mergers.\nOur level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements or to carry out other aspects of our business;\n\u2022\nincrease our cost of borrowing;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements or to carry out other aspects of our business;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to make material acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities that may arise;\n\u2022\nexpose us to fluctuations in interest rates, to the extent our borrowings bear variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a potential disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\n\u2022\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on and be subject to our future financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors beyond our control, including the availability of financing in the banking and capital markets. Our business may fail to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow funds in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments on our debt, to refinance our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we were unable to make payments on or refinance our debt or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we would have to consider other options, such as asset sales, equity issuances or negotiations with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt. The terms of debt agreements that we entered into in connection with the Spin-Off and Mergers and market or business conditions may limit our ability to take some or all of these actions. In addition, if we incur additional debt, the related risks described above could be exacerbated.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness will contain restrictive covenants, which will restrict our operational flexibility.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness will contain restrictions and limitations on our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests, including covenants that place limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness; the creation of liens; the payment of dividends; sales of assets; fundamental changes, including mergers and acquisitions; loans and investments; negative pledges; transactions with affiliates; restrictions affecting subsidiaries; modification to charter documents in a manner materially adverse to the lenders; and changes in fiscal year and limitations on conduct of business.\nIn addition, certain agreements governing our indebtedness will contain financial covenants, including covenants requiring, as at the end of, and for, each fiscal quarter of Perspecta ending after the Distribution Date, (a) a ratio of consolidated total net debt to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the debt agreement) not in excess of 4.50:1.00, stepping down to 3.75:1.00 no later than the end of the first full fiscal quarter ending at least 18 months after the Distribution Date; and (b) a consolidated EBITDA to interest expense ratio of not less than 3.00:1.00. The agreements governing our indebtedness will also contain affirmative covenants and representations and warranties customary for financings of this type.\nEvents beyond our control could affect our ability to meet these covenants. Our failure to comply with obligations under the agreements governing our indebtedness may result in an event of default under those agreements. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. This could have serious consequences to our financial condition, operating results and business and could cause us to become insolvent or enter bankruptcy proceedings.\nWe may need to raise additional capital, and we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available.\nSubsequent to the Spin-Off, we will need to fund our ongoing working capital, capital expenditure and financing requirements through cash flows from operations and new sources of capital, including additional financing. Our ability to obtain future financing will depend, among other things, on our financial condition and results of operations as well as on the condition of the capital markets or other credit markets at the time we seek financing. Increased volatility and disruptions in the financial markets could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain financing. In addition, the adoption of new statutes and regulations, the implementation of recently enacted laws or new interpretations or the enforcement of older laws and regulations applicable to the financial markets or the financial services industry could result in a reduction in the amount of available credit or an increase in the cost of credit. Historically, we have relied on DXC (our former Parent) and its credit facilities and its access to capital for our financing needs but, since the Spin-Off, we do not\nhave access to DXC\u2019s credit for our future financings. As a new independent public company, we may not have sufficient access to the capital markets on terms that we will we find acceptable.\nChanges in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition.\nGAAP and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including but not limited to revenue recognition, business combinations, impairment of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets and equity-based compensation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition.\nWe may be unable to realize the anticipated cost savings or synergies within the anticipated time frame or in the anticipated amounts, or may incur additional and/or unexpected costs in order to realize them.\nWe may not be able to realize the anticipated cost savings or synergies from the Spin-Off and Mergers in the anticipated amounts or within the anticipated timeframes or costs expectations or at all. The cost savings and synergies that we realize may differ materially from our estimates. We cannot provide assurances that these anticipated savings and synergies will be achieved or that our programs and improvements will be completed as anticipated or at all. In addition, any cost savings that we realize may be offset, in whole or in part, by reductions in revenues or through increases in other expenses. The projections and assumptions related to cost savings and synergies contained herein are based on our current estimates, but they involve risks, uncertainties, projections and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements, express or implied.\nAssumptions relating to these projections involve subjective decisions and judgments with respect to, among other things, the estimated impact of certain operational adjustments, labor management and other cost and savings adjustments, as well as future economic, competitive, industry and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of our management. The internal financial projections used to calculate estimated cost savings also do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date on which they were prepared. These internal financial projections reflect assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. As a result, actual results may differ materially from those contained in these internal financial projections.\nFailure to realize the expected costs savings and synergies related to the Spin-Off and Mergers could result in increased costs and have an adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s financial results and prospects.\nRecent U.S. tax legislation may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRecently enacted U.S. tax legislation has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations, including by reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions, permitting immediate expensing of certain capital expenditures, adopting elements of a territorial tax system, and revising the rules governing net operating losses. Many of these changes are effective immediately, without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions. The legislation is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. In addition, it is unclear how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities.\nPrior to the formation of Perspecta, the deferred tax assets and liabilities of each of the merged companies were revalued and the non-cash tax rate benefits arising from the revaluation of deferred tax items was recognized by each of the legal entity groups that make up Perspecta for the period immediately prior to the Mergers. There may be future adjustments that would impact the tax rate in subsequent periods throughout fiscal year 2019 in accordance with recent interpretive guidance issued by the SEC. Further, there may be other material adverse effects resulting from the legislation that we have not yet identified.\nOur ability to pursue strategic acquisitions and partnerships may impact our ability to compete in the markets we serve.\nAside from pursuing organic growth, we may explore potential strategic acquisitions that could allow us to expand our operations. However, we may be unable to identify attractive candidates or complete acquisitions on terms favorable to us. In addition, our ability to successfully integrate the operations we acquire and leverage these operations to generate revenue and earnings growth may significantly impact future revenue and earnings as well as investor returns. Integrating acquired operations is a significant challenge and we may not be able to manage such integrations successfully. Failure to successfully integrate acquired operations may adversely affect our cost structure, thereby reducing our margins and return on investment.\nWe have also entered into, and expect to seek to enter into, additional strategic partnerships with other industry participants as part of an effort to expand our business. However, we may be unable to identify attractive strategic partnership candidates or complete such partnerships on terms favorable to us. In addition, if we are unable to successfully implement our partnership strategies or our strategic partners do not fulfill their obligations or otherwise do not prove advantageous to our business, our investments in such partnerships and our anticipated business expansion could be adversely affected.\nAchieving our growth objectives may prove unsuccessful. We may be unable to identify future attractive acquisitions and strategic partnerships, which may adversely affect our growth. In addition, our ability to consummate or integrate acquisitions or to consummate or implement our strategic partnerships may be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to the Spin-Off and Mergers\nThe Spin-Off and Mergers may result in disruptions to relationships with customers and other business partners or may not achieve the intended results.\nWe may not be able to realize the intended benefits of the transactions or that the combined company will perform as anticipated. Specifically, the proposed transactions could cause disruptions in our business, including by disrupting operations or causing customers to delay or to defer decisions or to end their relationships, or otherwise limiting the ability to compete for or perform certain contracts or services or other potential effects relating to organizational conflict of interest issues, including action to mitigate or avoid organizational conflicts of interest or lost business opportunity. If we face difficulties in integrating the legacy businesses of USPS, Vencore HC and KGS HC, or we face difficulties in our business generally, the Spin-Off and Mergers may not achieve the intended results.\nFurther, it is possible that employees of USPS, Vencore HC and KGS HC legacy companies could experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company, which could harm the ability of our business to attract and retain key personnel. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, our financial condition and our results of operations and prospects.\nThe actions required to implement the Spin-Off and Mergers take significant management time and attention and may require us to incur significant costs.\nThe Spin-Off and Mergers have required, and are expected to continue to require, significant amounts of management\u2019s time and resources, which is in addition to, and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from, the operation of our remaining businesses and the execution of our other strategic initiatives. Additionally, we have incurred significant costs in connection with the Spin-Off and Mergers, and may incur future significant costs related to integration of USPS and Vencore HC and KGS HC.\nWe could have an indemnification obligation to DXC if the Distribution were determined not to qualify for tax-free treatment, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nIf, due to any transaction undertaken by us, it was determined that the Distribution was determined not to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \u201cCode\u201d), DXC would generally be subject to tax as if it sold the DXC common stock in a taxable transaction, which could result in a material tax liability. In addition, each DXC stockholder who received Perspecta common stock in the Distribution would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the Perspecta common stock received by the stockholder in the Distribution.\nIn addition, the Distribution would be taxable to DXC (but not to DXC stockholders) pursuant to Section 355(e) of the Code if one or more persons acquire a 50% or greater interest in the stock of DXC or us, directly or indirectly (including through acquisitions of our stock after the Mergers), as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Distribution. In addition, Section 355(e) of the Code generally creates a presumption that any direct or indirect acquisition of stock of DXC or us within two years before or after the Distribution is part of a plan that includes the Distribution, although the parties may be able to rebut that presumption in certain circumstances. The process for determining whether an acquisition is part of a plan under these rules is complex, inherently factual in nature, and subject to a comprehensive analysis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. If the IRS were to determine that direct or indirect acquisitions of stock of DXC or us, either before or after the Distribution, were part of a plan that includes the Distribution, such determination could cause Section 355(e) of the Code to apply to the Distribution, which could result in a material tax liability.\nUnder the Tax Matters Agreement, we were required to indemnify DXC against taxes resulting from the Distribution arising as a result of any Prohibited Act (as defined in the Tax Matters Agreement). If we were required to indemnify DXC for taxes resulting from a Prohibited Act, that indemnification obligation would likely be substantial and could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nTo address compliance with Section 355(e) of the Code, in the Tax Matters Agreement, we agreed to certain restrictions that may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or engage in other transactions, including stock issuances, certain asset dispositions, mergers, consolidations and other strategic transactions for a period of time following the Distribution. As a result, we may determine to forgo certain transactions that otherwise could be advantageous.\nUnder the Tax Matters Agreement, Perspecta is restricted from taking certain actions that could adversely affect the intended U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Spin-Off and such restrictions could significantly impair Perspecta\u2019s ability to implement strategic initiatives that otherwise would be beneficial.\nThe Tax Matters Agreement generally restricts us from taking certain actions that could adversely affect the intended U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Spin-Off. Failure to adhere to these restrictions, including in certain circumstances that may be outside of our control, could result in tax being imposed on DXC for which we could bear responsibility and for which we could be obligated to indemnify DXC. In addition, even if we are not responsible for tax liabilities of DXC under the Tax Matters Agreement, we nonetheless could be liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities if DXC were to fail to pay such taxes. Because of these provisions in the Tax Matters Agreement, we are restricted from taking certain actions, particularly for the two years following the Spin-Off, including (among other things) the ability to freely issue stock, to make certain acquisitions and to raise additional equity capital. These restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition, and otherwise could impair our ability to implement strategic initiatives. Also, our indemnity obligation to DXC might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may consider favorable.\nCertain of our directors and officers have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their previous or continuing positions at DXC.\nBecause of their current or former positions with DXC, certain of our directors and officers own DXC common stock and equity awards. Although our Board of Directors consists of a majority of directors who are independent, some of our directors and officers continue to have a financial interest in DXC common stock and equity awards. In addition, certain members of our Board of Directors are employed by or otherwise associated with DXC. Continuing ownership of DXC common stock and equity awards, or service as a director at both companies could create, or appear to create, potential\nconflicts of interest if we have disagreements with DXC about the contracts between us that continue, or face decisions that could have different implications for us and DXC.\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Spin-Off.\nWe believe that, as an independent publicly-traded company, we will be able to, among other things, better focus our financial and operational resources on our specific business, implement and maintain a capital structure designed to meet our specific needs, design and implement corporate strategies and policies that are targeted to our business, more effectively respond to industry dynamics and create effective incentives for our management and employees that are more closely tied to our business performance. However, by separating from DXC, we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events. In addition, we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company in the time we expect, if at all. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, the changes necessary to operate as an independent publicly-traded company, and we may experience increased costs after the Spin-Off.\nWe have historically operated as part of DXC\u2019s corporate organization, and DXC has provided us with various corporate functions. Following the Spin-Off, DXC has no obligation to provide us with assistance other than pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement and other agreements described under \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence - Agreements with DXC.\u201d These services do not include every service that we have received from DXC in the past. Accordingly, following the Spin-Off, we will need to provide internally or obtain from unaffiliated third parties the services we previously received from DXC. These services include IT, tax administration, treasury activities, technical accounting, benefits administration, procurement, legal, and ethics and compliance program administration, the effective and appropriate performance of which are critical to our operations. We may be unable to replace these services in a timely manner or on terms and conditions as favorable as those we receive from DXC. Because our business has historically operated as part of the wider DXC organization, we may be unable to successfully establish the infrastructure or implement the changes necessary to operate independently, or may incur additional costs that could adversely affect our business. As part of DXC, we have benefited from DXC\u2019s size and purchasing power in procuring certain goods and services such as insurance and health care benefits, and technology such as computer software licenses. If we fail to obtain the quality of services necessary to operate effectively or incur greater costs in obtaining goods and services, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\nWe have no recent operating history as an independent publicly-traded company, and our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nWe derived the Perspecta historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K from DXC\u2019s combined and consolidated financial statements, and this information does not necessarily reflect the results of operations and financial positions we would have achieved as an independent publicly-traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future. This is primarily because of the following factors:\n\u2022\nPrior to the Spin-Off, we operated as part of DXC\u2019s broader corporate organization and DXC performed various corporate functions for us, including IT, tax administration, treasury activities, technical accounting, benefits administration, procurement, legal and ethics and compliance program administration. Our historical financial information reflects allocations of corporate expenses from DXC for these and similar functions. These allocations may not reflect the costs we will incur for similar services in the future as an independent publicly-traded company.\n\u2022\nWe will enter into transactions with DXC that did not exist prior to the Spin-Off, such as DXC\u2019s provision of certain IT services, which will cause us to incur new costs.\n\u2022\nOur historical financial information does not reflect changes that we expect to experience in the future as a result of our separation from DXC, including changes in our cost structure, personnel needs, tax profile, financing and business operations. As part of DXC, we enjoyed certain benefits from DXC\u2019s operating diversity, size, purchasing power, borrowing leverage and available capital for investments, and we will lose these benefits after the Spin-Off. As an independent entity, we may be unable to purchase goods, services\nand technologies, such as insurance and health care benefits and computer software licenses, or access capital markets on terms as favorable to us as those we obtained as part of DXC prior to the Spin-Off.\n\u2022\nThe Mergers will result in our consolidated operations and the results therefrom being substantially different than USPS\u2019s operations and the results therefrom and a result, our historical information will not necessarily reflect our results of operations going forward.\nFollowing the Spin-Off, we are also responsible for the additional costs associated with being an independent publicly-traded company, including costs related to corporate governance, investor and public relations, and public reporting. Therefore, the Financial Statements may not be indicative of our future performance as an independent publicly-traded company. While we have been profitable as part of DXC, we cannot assure you that our profits will continue at a similar level when we are an independent publicly-traded company. For additional information about our past financial performance and the basis of presentation of the Financial Statements, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the Combined Financial Statements and the Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nUSPS's historical financial data is not necessarily representative of the results Perspecta would have achieved and may not be a reliable indicator of the combined company\u2019s future results.\nUSPS's historical financial data may not reflect what the legacy businesses' results of operations and financial position would have been had we been a combined company, and publicly traded, during the periods presented, or what our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will be in the future.\nSome of the contracts to be transferred or assigned to us contain provisions requiring the consent of third parties in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Internal Reorganization and Distribution. If these consents are not obtained, we may be unable to enjoy the benefit of these contracts in the future.\nPrior to the Distribution, DXC undertook a series of internal transactions, following which Perspecta owns the assets and liabilities of USPS (the \u201cInternal Reorganization\u201d). Some of the contracts to be transferred or assigned to us in connection with the Internal Reorganization and Distribution contain provisions that require the consent of third parties to the Internal Reorganization, the Distribution or both. Failure to obtain such consents on commercially reasonable and satisfactory terms may impair our entitlement to the benefit of these contracts in the future.\nCertain of our legal entities, including ES LLC, are required to change their names within six months of the Distribution and others will undergo a name change to align with our brand. We expect to enter into a change of name agreement with the U.S. federal government to effect these name changes, and will be required to complete various administrative tasks relating to completion of the change of name process for those contracts and contract vehicles held by those legal entities. While we do not expect the completion of the process to delay payments to us in any material respect on contracts affected by the name change, we may experience protest by competitors of new awards of contracts to us on grounds relating to the Spin-Off.\nWe may have been able to receive better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we received in our agreements with DXC that are based on the costs historically allocated to us by DXC.\nWe entered into agreements with DXC related to our separation from DXC, including the SDA, Transition Services Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, IPMA, Real Estate Matters Agreement and Non-U.S. Agency Agreement and other agreements, while we were still part of DXC. These agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm's-length negotiations among unaffiliated third parties. The terms of these agreements relate to, among other things, allocations of assets, liabilities, rights, indemnifications and other obligations between DXC and us. We may have received better terms from third parties because third parties may have competed with each other to win our business. Among other things, pursuant to the IPMA, DXC retains ownership of all proprietary IP (other than certain restricted IP developed by us, which DXC will assign to us) and licenses to Perspecta certain rights we require for use solely in connection with U.S. federal and certain U.S. state and local government customers, on a perpetual, royalty-free, non-assignable basis. See \"Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\"\nOur potential indemnification liabilities pursuant to the SDA could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe SDA between us and DXC provides for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions required to effect the Spin-Off, certain conditions to the Spin-Off and provisions governing the relationship between us and DXC after the Spin-Off. Among other things, the SDA provides for indemnification obligations designed to make us financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to or arising out of our business. If we are required to indemnify DXC under the circumstances set forth in the SDA, we may be subject to substantial liabilities. For a description of the SDA, see \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence - Agreements with DXC - Separation and Distribution Agreement.\u201d\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, DXC will indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, these indemnities may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities, or DXC\u2019s ability to satisfy its indemnification obligation may be impaired in the future.\nPursuant to the SDA and other agreements we entered into in connection with the Spin-Off, DXC has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities. However, third parties could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that DXC will agree to retain pursuant to these agreements, and DXC may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations under these agreements. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from DXC any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses while seeking recovery from DXC.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock and Capital Structure\nAn active trading market may not develop or be sustained. In addition, our stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nWe cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade after the Spin-Off. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business;\n\u2022\nsuccess or failure of our business strategies;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock after the Spin-Off;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of our company and the IT services industry;\n\u2022\noverall market fluctuations;\n\u2022\nresults from any material litigation or government investigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations (including tax laws and regulations) affecting our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and other external factors.\nFurthermore, our business profile and market capitalization may not fit the investment objectives of some DXC stockholders and, as a result, these DXC stockholders may sell their shares of our common stock after the Distribution. See \u201cSubstantial sales of our common stock may occur in connection with the Spin-Off, which could cause our stock price to decline.\u201d Low trading volume for our stock, which may occur if an active trading market does not develop, among other reasons, would amplify the effect of the above factors on our stock price volatility.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nSubstantial sales of our common stock may occur in connection with the Spin-Off, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nDXC stockholders receiving shares of our common stock in the Distribution generally may sell those shares immediately in the public market. Although we have no actual knowledge of any plan or intention of any significant DXC stockholder to sell our common stock following the Spin-Off, it is likely that some DXC stockholders, possibly including some of its larger stockholders, will sell their shares of our common stock received in the Distribution if, for reasons such as our business profile or market capitalization as an independent company, we do not fit their investment objectives or, in the case of index funds, we are not a participant in the index in which they are investing. Following the Mergers, approximately 14% of our outstanding shares of common stock (on a fully diluted basis, excluding certain unvested equity incentive awards) is owned by Veritas Capital. Pursuant to the Side Letter Agreement, all of these shares will be eligible to be registered, subject to certain limitations, following the consummation of the Mergers. For a description of the Side Letter Agreement, see \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence - Agreement with Veritas Capital.\u201d These shares will also be eligible for resale in the public market without registration subject to volume, manner of sale and holding period limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). The sales of significant amounts of our common stock or the perception in the market that this will occur may decrease the market price of our common stock.\nWe may not pay dividends on our common stock and our indebtedness may limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nFollowing the Spin-Off, the timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders will fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors\u2019 decisions regarding the payment of future dividends will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our business and covenants associated with debt obligations, as well as legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. We may not pay a dividend in the future, or continue to pay any dividend if we do commence paying dividends, and, in the future, the combined annual dividends paid on DXC common stock, if any, and our common stock, if any, may not equal the annual dividends on DXC common stock prior to the Spin-Off.\nYour percentage ownership in Perspecta may be diluted in the future.\nYour percentage ownership in Perspecta may be diluted in the future because of equity awards that we expect to grant to our directors, officers and other employees. Prior to completion of the Spin-Off, we approved an incentive plan that will provide for the grant of common share-based equity awards to our directors, officers and other employees. In addition, we may issue equity as all or part of the consideration paid for acquisitions and strategic investments that we may make in the future or as necessary to finance our ongoing operations.\nWe have contracts with the U.S. federal government that are classified which may limit investor insight into portions of our business.\nOver the last three fiscal years of USPS and Vencore, an average of 4% of the revenues of USPS and 52% of the revenues of Vencore were derived from classified programs with the U.S. federal government that are subject to security restrictions which preclude the dissemination of information that is classified for national security purposes. We are limited in our ability to provide information about these classified programs, their risks or any disputes or claims relating to such programs. As a result, investors may have less insight into our classified programs than our other programs and therefore less ability to fully evaluate the risks related to our classified business.\nProvisions in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws and of Nevada law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nSeveral provisions of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, Amended and Restated Bylaws and Nevada law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable. These include provisions that:\n\u2022\npermit us to issue blank check preferred stock with voting, conversion and exchange rights that could negatively affect the voting power or other rights of our common stockholders, and the Board of Directors could take that action without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\npreclude stockholders from calling special meetings except where such special meetings are requested by stockholders representing 75% of the capital stock entitled to vote. Our Amended and Restated Bylaws prevent stockholder action by written consent for the election of directors and require the written consent of 90% of the capital stock entitled to vote for any other stockholder actions by written consent;\n\u2022\nrequire stockholders to follow certain advance notice and disclosure requirements in order to propose business or nominate directors at an annual or special meeting; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to enter into business combination transactions with certain stockholders.\nThese and other provisions of our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, Amended and Restated Bylaws and Nevada law may discourage, delay or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or a threatened acquisition or change in control of Perspecta, including unsolicited takeover attempts, even though the transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock at a price above the prevailing market price. See \u201cDescription of Our Capital Stock Anti-Takeover Effects of Various Provisions of Nevada Law and Our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws\u201d for more information.", "PERMNO": 17792, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "PRSP"}
