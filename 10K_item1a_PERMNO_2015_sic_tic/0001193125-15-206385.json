RISK FACTORS\nThe following are significant factors known to us that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. These risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and from results predicted by forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements made by us are qualified by the risks described below. There may be additional risks that are not presently material or known. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGeneral economic conditions and other external factors may adversely affect our industry and results of operations.\nCompanies within the snowmobile, ATV and ROV industries are subject to volatility in operating results due to external factors such as general economic conditions, including high unemployment and economic recession. Specific factors affecting the industry include:\n\u2022\nOverall consumer confidence and the level of discretionary consumer spending;\n\u2022\nInterest rates and related higher dealer floorplan costs;\n\u2022\nSales incentives and promotional costs;\n\u2022\nAdverse impact on margins due to increases in raw material and transportation costs that companies are unable to pass on to dealers without negatively affecting sales; and\n\u2022\nFluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates.\nOur products are subject to extensive federal and state safety, environmental and other government regulations that may require us to incur expenses or modify product offerings in order to maintain compliance with regulations.\nOur products are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to safety, environmental and other regulations promulgated by the U.S. and Canadian federal governments and individual states and provinces as well as international regulatory authorities. Although we believe that our snowmobiles, ATVs and ROVs have always complied with applicable vehicle safety and emissions standards and related regulations, future regulations may require additional safety standards or emission reductions that would require additional expenses and/or modification of product offerings in order to maintain such compliance. We are unable to predict the ultimate impact of adopted or proposed regulations on our business and operating results.\nA significant adverse determination in any material product liability or intellectual property claim against us could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. Accidents involving personal injury and property damage may occur in the use of snowmobiles, ATVs and ROVs and claims have been made against us from time to time relating to these accidents. In addition, our products, and the products of our competitors, incorporate significant amounts of intellectual property developed by us and others and, from time to time, parties assert claims against us relating to their intellectual property. It is our policy to vigorously defend against these product liability and intellectual property claims. We have recorded a reserve based on our estimated range of potential exposures to the legal proceedings and claims of which we are aware. Should any judgment or settlement occur that exceeds our estimate, or a new claim arise, we may need to adjust our overall reserve and, depending on the amount, such adjustment could be material and adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.\nSignificant repair and/or replacement with respect to product warranty claims or product recalls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe provide a limited warranty on retail sales for a period of six months for our ATVs and ROVs and one year for our snowmobiles. We may provide longer warranties in certain geographical markets as determined by local regulations and market conditions. Although we employ quality control procedures, sometimes a product is distributed that requires repair or replacement. Our standard warranties require us through our dealers to repair or replace defective products during such warranty periods at no cost to the consumer. Historically, product recalls have been administered through our dealers and distributors and have not had a material effect on our business.\nChanging weather conditions may reduce demand for certain of our products and negatively impact net sales.\nLack of snowfall in any year in particular regions of North America and Northern Europe may adversely affect snowmobile retail sales and related parts, garments and accessories sales in that region. Weather conditions may materially affect our future sales of snowmobiles, ATVs, ROVs and parts, garments and accessories.\nWe face intense competition in all product lines, from competitors that have greater financial and marketing resources. Failure to compete effectively against competitors would negatively impact our business and operating results.\nThe snowmobile, ATV and ROV markets worldwide are highly competitive. Competition is based upon a number of factors, including performance, ride, suspension, innovation, technology, styling, fit and finish, brand loyalty, reliability, durability, price and distribution. At the dealer level, competition is based on a number of factors including sales and marketing support programs (such as sales incentives and cooperative advertising). Many of our competitors are more diversified and have financial and marketing resources that are substantially greater than ours. In addition, our products compete with other recreational products for the discretionary spending of consumers. If we are not able to effectively compete in this environment, our business and operating results will be negatively impacted.\nTermination or interruption of engine and other supply arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nIn the event that we need to obtain substitute supply arrangements for engine or other raw materials or components for which we rely upon limited sources of supply, alternate supply arrangements may not be available with comparable terms.\nFluctuations in foreign currency rates could result in declines in our reported net sales and net earnings\nOur reported net sales and cost of goods sold are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. During fiscal 2015, sales to Canadian dealers that are denominated in Canadian dollars comprised 27.6% of total net sales. Sales to European on-road ATV dealers and distributors are made in Euros with the Euro serving as the functional currency. During fiscal 2015, sales to European on-road ATV dealers comprised 4.9% of total net sales. During fiscal 2015, we utilized cash flow hedges to help mitigate the variability in Canadian exchange rate changes relating to Canadian dollar fund transfers to the United States. During fiscal 2015, approximately 9.8% of our total cost of goods sold was purchased from Japanese yen denominated suppliers. The majority of these purchases were made from Suzuki and Yamaha for engines for our snowmobiles. We have an agreement with Suzuki for snowmobile engine purchases to share the impact of fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen above and below a fixed range contained in the agreement. A change in foreign currency exchange rates could materially affect our business and operating results.\nInterruption of dealer floorplan financing could have a material impact on our business operations.\nWe have agreements with GE Commercial Distribution Finance in the United States and TCF Commercial Finance Canada in Canada to provide snowmobile, ATV and ROV floorplan financing for our North American dealers. These agreements improve our liquidity by financing dealer purchases of our products without requiring substantial use of our working capital. We are paid by the floorplan companies shortly after shipment and as part of our marketing programs we pay the floorplan financing of our dealers for certain set time periods depending on the size of a dealer\u2019s order. While we expect to continue with our current multi-year dealer floorplan arrangements, these arrangements may not remain available or the costs and other terms of new financing arrangements may be significantly less favorable to us than have historically been available.\nTermination, interruption or nonrenewal of bank credit agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nThe seasonality of our snowmobile, ATV and ROV production cycles generates significant fluctuations in our working capital requirements during each year. Historically, we have financed our working capital requirements out of available cash balances at the beginning and end of the production cycle and with short-term bank borrowings during the middle of this cycle. While we expect to continue with our current multi-year working capital financing agreement from our\nlender, working capital financing arrangements may not remain available or the costs and other terms of new financing arrangements may be significantly less favorable to us than have historically been available. In addition, our current bank credit agreement contains covenants which we might be unable to meet in some future period requiring the need for waivers or alternate financing.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and prevent fraud.\nA material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual and interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis.\nOur efforts to maintain our internal controls may not be successful, and we may be unable to maintain effective controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future and comply with the certification and reporting obligations under Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Any failure to maintain effective controls could result in material misstatements that are not prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis, which could potentially subject us to sanction or investigation by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and adversely affect our business and our stock price.", "PERMNO": 76207, "SIC": 3790, "TIC": "ACAT"}
