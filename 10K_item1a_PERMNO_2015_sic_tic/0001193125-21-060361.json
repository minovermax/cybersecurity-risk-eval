The pandemic has also exacerbated many of the other risks discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Although an economic recovery is partially underway, it continues to be uneven and characterized by meaningful dispersion across sectors and regions, with uncertainty regarding its ultimate length and trajectory.\nThe longer the pandemic impacts activity levels in the locations and sectors in which we and our portfolio companies operate, the more likely it is to have a sustained, material impact on the economy and on us. In particular, issues with respect to the distribution or adoption of vaccines or the spread of variants of the virus could lead people to continue to self-isolate and not participate in the economy at pre-pandemic\nlevels for a prolonged period of time. These and other factors may delay a return to pre-pandemic,\nordinary course economic activity, or cause the U.S. economy or other major global economies to experience a recession.\nIf and when the COVID-19\npandemic subsides, the market turmoil and other changes associated with the pandemic may have lasting effects on our business and operations. The proliferation of remote working may result in long-term changed market, consumer and workplace practices that could negatively impact us and our business. Increased adoption of and familiarity with remote work practices could result in continued decreased demand for business and leisure travel, hotel stays, conference facilities, select U.S. urban residential and office assets, diesel fuel and gasoline. In addition, consumer practices and demands may permanently, or for an extended period, change from what they were prior to the onset of COVID-19,\nincluding avoiding activities where people are in close proximity to each other, which could adversely affect certain of our investments. Failure of our investment strategies to adapt to these and other changes could adversely impact the returns on our investments.\nAdverse impacts on our business as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic include, and may in the future include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nPerformance Revenues\n. Our ability to realize value from our investments was adversely impacted, and could continue to be adversely impacted, by decreased portfolio company revenues and earnings, lack of potential buyers with financial resources to pursue an acquisition, and limited access to the equity capital markets. During the year ended December 31, 2020, certain of our unrealized investment valuations, particularly in the sectors most directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, declined significantly from their valuations at December 31, 2019. Valuation declines in 2020 resulted in a decline in our Net Accrued Performance Revenues as of December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019. Such declines, if sustained, would adversely impact our Realized Performance Revenues in future periods. During parts of 2020, limited opportunities for realizing gains also delayed or eliminated receipt of performance revenues as preferred return thresholds became harder to achieve. Although the continuing market recovery through the fourth quarter of 2020 has contributed to capital deployment and realizations, a potential market downturn, or a slower economic recovery, and associated declines in the value of investments as well as limited capital deployment and realization opportunities could reduce our performance revenues.\n\u2022\nManagement Fees\n. As discussed above, while continuing market recovery since the onset of the COVID-19\npandemic has contributed to capital deployment, realization and fundraising activity, a potential market downturn may cause us to experience a decline in the pace of our investments. The pandemic slowed our anticipated fundraising pace for new or successor funds during the first quarter of 2020. Although our fundraising pace substantially recovered during the remainder of 2020, we may experience another such decline in the pace of our investments and of our recovery. If our funds are unable to deploy capital at a pace that is sufficient to offset the pace of our realizations, our fee revenues could decrease.\n\u2022\nInvestment Performance\n. Many of our investments are in industries that have been materially impacted by COVID-19\nand related public health restrictions and recommendations, including shutdowns or limitations in operations. For example, certain investments in our real estate portfolio, such as those in the hospitality, location-based entertainment and retail sectors and, in certain geographies, in the office and residential sectors as well as in our private equity portfolio, such as those in the travel, leisure and events sectors, have experienced material reductions in value and continue to be adversely impacted. Similarly, in the first quarter of 2020, our energy investments were materially adversely impacted by supply and demand shocks that created historic dislocation in the energy markets. We have also seen an increasing focus toward rent regulation as a means to address residential affordability caused by undersupply of housing in certain markets in the U.S. and Europe, as well as an increasing focus on the institution of eviction limitations in response to the COVID-19\npandemic in the U.S. Such conditions (which may be across industries, sectors or geographies) may contribute to adverse operating performance, including by moderating rent growth in certain geographies and markets in our residential portfolio. If the disruptions caused by COVID-19\ncontinue, the businesses of impacted portfolio companies could suffer materially, which would decrease the value of our funds\u2019 investments. Furthermore, such negative market conditions could potentially result in a portfolio company entering bankruptcy proceedings, thereby potentially resulting in a complete loss of the fund\u2019s investment in such portfolio company and a significant negative impact to the investment fund\u2019s performance and consequently to our operating results and cash flow, as well as to our reputation.\n\u2022\nLiquidity\n. Our portfolio companies faced, and may face in the future, increased credit and liquidity risk due to volatility in financial markets, reduced revenue streams, and limited access or higher cost of financing, which may result in potential impairment of our or our funds\u2019 investments. Changes in the debt financing markets impacted, and may in the future impact, the ability of our portfolio companies to meet their respective financial obligations. For example, the initial outbreak of the pandemic created additional pressure for certain of our portfolio companies\u2019 and investments\u2019 liquidity needs, including by adversely impacting rent collection and operational performance in certain sectors and geographies. Although we have multiple sources of liquidity to meet our capital needs, changes in the debt financing markets may also in the future impact our ability to refinance our debt obligations. In addition, borrowers of loans, notes and other credit instruments in our credit funds\u2019 portfolios may be unable to meet their principal or interest payment obligations or satisfy financial covenants, and tenants leasing real estate properties owned by our funds may not be able to pay rents in a timely manner or at all, resulting in a decrease in value of our funds\u2019 credit and real estate investments and lower than expected return. In addition, for variable rate instruments, lower reference rates resulting from government stimulus programs in response to COVID-19\ncould lead to lower interest income for our credit funds. We experienced a period of significant dislocation during the first quarter of 2020, when the liquidity of certain assets traded in the credit markets was limited. Another period of such dislocation due to the economic uncertainty could impact the value of certain assets held by our real estate debt, credit and Hedge Fund Solutions funds, such funds\u2019 ability to sell assets at attractive prices or in a timely manner in order to avoid losses and the likelihood of margin calls from credit providers. In addition, a sudden contraction of liquidity in the credit markets, including as a result of overwhelming desire for liquidity on the part of market participants, is likely to exacerbate the likelihood of forced sales of assets and margins calls, which would result in further declines in the value of assets. For example, in our Hedge Funds Solutions segment, such a contraction could cause investors to seek liquidity in the form of redemptions from our funds, adversely impacting management fees.\n\u2022\nOperational Risks\n. In accordance with local government guidance and social distancing recommendations, the majority of our employees globally have been working remotely during the COVID-19\npandemic. While our technology infrastructure has supported remote work, such working environments may be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks, including phishing and social engineering attempts that seek to exploit the COVID-19\npandemic. In addition, third party service providers on whom we have become increasingly reliant for certain aspects of our business, including for certain information systems, technology (including cloud-based services) and the administration of certain funds, could be impacted by an inability to perform due to COVID-19\nrestrictions or by failures of, or attacks on, their information systems and technology.\n\u2022\nEmployee-Related Risks\n. COVID-19\ncontinues to present a significant threat to our employees\u2019 and their families\u2019 well-being. Our employees or executive officers may become sick or otherwise unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time, and extended public health restrictions and remote working arrangements may impact employee morale. In addition to any potential impact of such extended illness on our operations, we may be exposed to the risk of litigation by our employees against us for, among other things, failure to take adequate steps to protect their well-being, particularly in the event they become sick after a return to the office. A prolonged period of remote work may also make it more difficult to integrate new employees and maintain our culture.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19\npandemic will affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and prospects materially will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the pandemic, the duration of government measures to mitigate the pandemic and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict.\nDifficult market and geopolitical conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, each of which could materially reduce our revenue, earnings and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition.\nOur business is materially affected by financial market and economic conditions and events throughout the world that are outside our control. We may not be able to or may choose not to manage our exposure to these conditions and/or events. Such conditions and/or events can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, reducing the value or performance of the investments made by our funds and making it more difficult to fund opportunities for our funds to exist and realize value from existing investment. This could in turn materially reduce our revenue, earnings and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition. In addition, in the face of a difficult market or economic environment, we may need to reduce our fixed costs and other expenses in order to maintain profitability, including by cutting back or eliminating the use of certain services or service providers, or terminating the employment of a significant number of our personnel that, in each case, could be important to our business and without which our operating results could be adversely affected. A failure to manage or reduce our costs and other expenses within a time frame sufficient to match any decrease in profitability would adversely affect our operating performance.\nTurmoil in the global financial markets can provoke significant volatility of equity and debt securities prices. This can have a material and rapid impact on our mark-to-market\nvaluations, particularly with respect to our public holdings and credit investments. As publicly traded equity securities have in recent years represented a significant proportion of the assets of many of our carry funds, stock market volatility, including a sharp decline in the stock market, such as the one experienced in the first quarter of 2020, may adversely affect our results, including our revenues and net income. In addition, our public equity holdings have at times been and are currently concentrated in a few large positions, thereby making our unrealized mark-to-market\nvaluations particularly sensitive to sharp changes in the price of any of these positions. Further, although the equity markets are not the only means by which we exit investments, should we experience another period of challenging equity markets, our funds may experience increased difficulty in realizing value from investments.\nGeopolitical concerns and other global events, including, without limitation, trade conflict, national and international political circumstances (including wars, terrorist acts or security operations) and pandemics or other severe public health events, have contributed and may continue to contribute to volatility in global equity and debt markets.\nIn addition to the factors described above, other factors described herein that may affect market, economic and geopolitical conditions, and thereby adversely affect our business include, without limitation:\n\u2022\neconomic slowdown in the U.S. and internationally,\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates and/or a lack of availability of credit in the U.S. and internationally,\n\u2022\ncommodity price volatility, and\n\u2022\nchanges in law and/or regulation, and uncertainty regarding government and regulatory policy, including in connection with the new administration.\nA period of economic slowdown, which may be across one or more industries, sectors or geographies, has contributed and could in the future contribute to adverse operating performance for certain of our funds\u2019 investments, which would adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.\nCountries and industries around the globe continue to grapple with the economic impacts of the COVID-19\npandemic. Although the global economy has begun reopening, the economic recovery may continue to be uneven and characterized by meaningful dispersion across sectors and regions. Any deceleration in the rate of global growth in certain industries, sectors or geographies may contribute to poor financial results at our funds\u2019 portfolio companies, which may result in lower investment returns for our funds. For example, periods of economic weakness have and may in the future contribute to a decline in commodity prices and/or volatility in the oil and natural gas markets, each of which would have an adverse effect on our energy investments. The performance of our funds\u2019 portfolio companies would also likely be negatively impacted if pressure on wages and other inputs increasingly pressure profit margins. To the extent the performance of those portfolio companies (as well as valuation multiples) do not improve, our funds may sell those assets at values that are less than we projected or even a loss, thereby significantly affecting those investment funds\u2019 performance. In addition, as the governing agreements of our funds contain only limited requirements regarding diversification of fund investments (by, for example, sector or geographic region), during periods of economic slowdown in certain sectors or regions, the impact on our funds may be exacerbated by concentration of investments in such sector or region. As a result, our ability to raise new funds, as well as our operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, during periods of weakness, our funds\u2019 portfolio companies may also have difficulty expanding their businesses and operations or meeting their debt service obligations or other expenses as they become due, including expenses payable to us. Furthermore, such negative market conditions could potentially result in a portfolio company entering bankruptcy proceedings, thereby potentially resulting in a complete loss of the fund\u2019s investment in such portfolio company and a significant negative impact to the investment fund\u2019s performance and consequently to our operating results and cash flow, as well as to our reputation. In addition, negative market conditions would also increase the risk of default with respect to investments held by our funds that have significant debt investments, such as our credit-focused funds.\nAn increase in interest rates and other changes in the debt financing markets could negatively impact the ability of our funds and their portfolio companies to obtain attractive financing or refinancing and could increase the cost of such financing if it is obtained, which could lead to lower-yielding investments and potentially decrease our net income.\nInterest rates have remained at relatively low levels on a historical basis and the U.S. Federal Reserve maintained the federal funds target range at 0.0% to 0.25% for much of 2020, indicating that the current level would likely be held steady for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance, however, that the Federal Reserve will not raise rates in 2021. A period of sharply rising interest rates could create downward pressure on the price of real estate, increase the cost and availability of debt financing for the transactions our funds pursue and decrease the value of fixed-rate debt investments made by our funds, each of which may have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, a significant contraction or weakening in the market for debt financing or other adverse change relating to the terms of debt financing (such as, for example, higher equity requirements and/or more restrictive covenants), particularly in the area of acquisition financings for private equity and real\nestate transactions, could have a material adverse impact on our business. For example, a portion of the indebtedness used to finance certain fund investments often includes high-yield debt securities issued in the capital markets. Availability of capital from the high-yield debt markets is subject to significant volatility, and there may be times when we might not be able to access those markets at attractive rates, or at all, when completing an investment. For example, in the first half of 2020 the credit markets experienced a contraction in the availability of credit, which temporarily impacted the ability to obtain attractive debt financing transactions. Further, the financing of acquisitions or the operations of our funds\u2019 portfolio companies with debt may become less attractive due to limitations on the deductibility of corporate interest expense. See \u201c- Proposed changes in U.S. and foreign taxation of businesses could adversely affect us.\u201d\nIf our funds are unable to obtain committed debt financing for potential acquisitions, can only obtain debt financing at an increased interest rate or on unfavorable terms or the ability to deduct corporate interest expense is substantially limited, our funds may face increased competition from strategic buyers of assets who may have an overall lower cost of capital or the ability to benefit from a higher amount of cost savings following an acquisition, or may have difficulty completing otherwise profitable acquisitions or may generate profits that are lower than would otherwise be the case, each of which could lead to a decrease in our revenues. In addition, rising interest rates, coupled with periods of significant equity and credit market volatility may potentially make it more difficult for us to find attractive opportunities for our funds to exit and realize value from their existing investments.\nOur funds\u2019 portfolio companies also regularly utilize the corporate debt markets in order to obtain financing for their operations. To the extent monetary policy, tax or other regulatory changes or difficult credit markets render such financing difficult to obtain, more expensive or otherwise less attractive, this may also negatively impact the financial results of those portfolio companies and, therefore, the investment returns on our funds. In addition, to the extent that market conditions and/or tax or other regulatory changes make it difficult or impossible to refinance debt that is maturing in the near term, some of our funds\u2019 portfolio companies may be unable to repay such debt at maturity and may be forced to sell assets, undergo a recapitalization or seek bankruptcy protection.\nA decline in the pace or size of investment made by our funds may adversely affect our revenues.\nThe revenues that we earn are driven in part by the pace at which our funds make investments and the size of those investments, and a decline in the pace or the size of such investments may reduce our revenues. The market environment for private equity transactions, for example, has at times been characterized by relatively high prices, which can make the deployment of capital more difficult. In addition, many other factors could cause a decline in the pace of investment, including the inability of our investment professionals to identify attractive investment opportunities, competition for such opportunities among other potential acquirers, decreased availability of capital on attractive terms and our failure to consummate identified investment opportunities because of business, regulatory or legal complexities or uncertainty and adverse developments in the U.S. or global economy or financial markets. In addition, if our funds are unable to deploy capital at a pace that is sufficient to offset the pace of realizations, our fee revenues could decrease.\nOur revenue, earnings, net income and cash flow can all vary materially, which may make it difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis and may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur revenue, net income and cash flow can all vary materially due to our reliance on Performance Revenues. We may experience fluctuations in our results, including our revenue and net income, from quarter to quarter due to a number of other factors, including timing of realizations, changes in the valuations of our funds\u2019 investments, changes in the amount of distributions, dividends or interest paid in respect of investments, changes in our operating expenses, the degree to which we encounter competition and general economic and market conditions. Achieving steady growth in net income and cash flow on a quarterly basis may be difficult, which could in turn lead to large adverse movements or general increased volatility in the price of our common stock. We also do not provide any guidance regarding our expected quarterly and annual operating results. The lack of guidance may affect the expectations of public market analysts and could cause increased volatility in our common stock price.\nOur cash flow may fluctuate significantly due to the fact that we receive Performance Allocations from our carry funds only when investments are realized and achieve a certain preferred return. Performance Allocations depend on our carry funds\u2019 performance and opportunities for realizing gains, which may be limited. It takes a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities, to raise all the funds needed to make an investment and then to realize the cash value (or other proceeds) of an investment through a sale, public offering, recapitalization or other exit. Even if an investment proves to be profitable, it may be a number of years before any profits can be realized in cash (or other proceeds). We cannot predict when, or if, any realization of investments will occur.\nThe mark-to-market\nvaluations of investments made by our funds are subject to volatility driven by economic and market conditions. Economic and market conditions may also negatively impact our realization opportunities.\nThe valuations of and realization opportunities for investments made by our funds could also be subject to high volatility as a result of uncertainty regarding governmental policy with respect to, among other things, tax, financial services regulation, international trade, immigration, healthcare, labor, infrastructure and energy.\nIn addition, upon the realization of a profitable investment by any of our carry funds and prior to our receiving any Performance Allocations in respect of that investment, 100% of the proceeds of that investment must generally be paid to the investors in that carry fund until they have recovered certain fees and expenses and achieved a certain return on all realized investments by that carry fund as well as a recovery of any unrealized losses. A particular realization event may have a significant impact on our results for that particular quarter that may not be replicated in subsequent quarters. We recognize revenue on investments in our investment funds based on our allocable share of realized and unrealized gains (or losses) reported by such investment funds, and a decline in realized or unrealized gains, or an increase in realized or unrealized losses, would adversely affect our revenue and possibly cash flow, which could further increase the volatility of our quarterly results. Because our carry funds have preferred return thresholds to investors that need to be met prior to our receiving any Performance Allocations, substantial declines in the carrying value of the investment portfolios of a carry fund can significantly delay or eliminate any Performance Allocations paid to us in respect of that fund since the value of the assets in the fund would need to recover to their aggregate cost basis plus the preferred return over time before we would be entitled to receive any Performance Allocations from that fund.\nThe timing and receipt of Performance Allocations also varies with the life cycle of our carry funds. During periods in which a relatively large portion of our assets under management is attributable to carry funds and investments in their \u201charvesting\u201d period, our carry funds would make larger distributions than in the fundraising or investment periods that precede harvesting. During periods in which a significant portion of our assets under management is attributable to carry funds that are not in their harvesting periods, we may receive substantially lower Performance Allocations.\nWith respect to most of our funds of hedge funds, core+ real estate funds, infrastructure funds and credit-focused and real estate debt funds structured like hedge funds, our incentive income is paid between quarterly and every five years, and the varying frequency of these payments will contribute to the volatility of our cash flow. Furthermore, we earn this incentive income only if the net asset value of a fund has increased or, in the case of certain funds, increased beyond a particular return threshold. Certain of these funds also have \u201chigh water marks\u201d whereby we do not earn incentive income during a particular period even though the fund had positive returns in such period as a result of losses in prior periods. If one of these funds experiences losses, we will not be able to earn incentive income from the fund until it surpasses the previous high water mark. The incentive income we earn is therefore dependent on the net asset value of the fund, which could lead to significant volatility in our results.\nAdverse economic and market conditions may adversely affect the amount of cash generated by our businesses, and in turn, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nWe use cash to (a) provide capital to facilitate the growth of our existing businesses, which principally includes funding our general partner and co-investment\ncommitments to our funds, (b) provide capital for business expansion, (c) pay operating expenses and other obligations as they arise, including servicing our debt and (d) pay dividends to our stockholders and make distributions to the holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. Our principal sources of cash are: (a) cash we received in connection with our prior bond offerings, (b) Fee Related Earnings and (c) Net Realizations, which is the sum of Realized Principal Investment Income and Realized Performance Revenues less Realized Performance Compensation. We have also entered into a $2.25 billion revolving credit facility with a final maturity date of November 24, 2025. Our long-term debt totaled $5.7 billion in borrowings from our prior bond issuances and we had no borrowings outstanding against our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had $2.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $2.6 billion invested in our corporate treasury investments.\nIf the global economy and conditions in the financing markets worsen, our fund investment performance could suffer, resulting in, for example, the payment of less or no Performance Allocations to us. This could materially and adversely affect the amount of cash we have on hand, including for, among other purposes, the payment of dividends to our stockholders. Having less cash on hand could in turn require us to rely on other sources of cash (such as the capital markets, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms) for the above purposes. Furthermore, during adverse economic and market conditions, we might not be able to renew all or part of our existing revolving credit facility or find alternate financing on commercially reasonable terms. As a result, our uses of cash may exceed our sources of cash, thereby potentially affecting our liquidity position.\nWe depend on our founder and other key senior managing directors and the loss of their services would have a material adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition.\nWe depend on the efforts, skill, reputations and business contacts of our founder, Stephen A. Schwarzman, and other key senior managing directors, the information and deal flow they generate during the normal course of their activities and the synergies among the diverse fields of expertise and knowledge held by our professionals. Accordingly, our success will depend on the continued service of these individuals, who are not obligated to remain employed with us. Several key senior managing directors have left the firm in the past and others may do so in the future, and we cannot predict the impact that the departure of any key senior managing director will have on our ability to achieve our investment objectives. For example, the governing agreements of many of our funds generally provide investors with the ability to terminate the investment period in the event that certain \u201ckey persons\u201d in the fund do not provide the specified time commitment to the fund or our firm ceases to control the general partner. The loss of the services of any key senior managing directors could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, net income and cash flows and could harm our ability to maintain or grow assets under management in existing funds or raise additional funds in the future. We have historically relied in part on the interests of these professionals in the investment funds\u2019 carried interest and incentive fees to discourage them from leaving the firm. However, to the extent our investment funds perform poorly, thereby reducing the potential for carried interest and incentive fees, their interests in carried interest and incentive fees become less valuable to them and become less effective as incentives for them to continue to be employed at Blackstone.\nOur senior managing directors and other key personnel possess substantial experience and expertise and have strong business relationships with investors in our funds, clients and other members of the business community. As a result, the loss of these personnel could jeopardize our relationships with investors in our funds, our clients and members of the business community and result in the reduction of assets under management or fewer investment opportunities.\nOur publicly traded structure may adversely affect our ability to retain and motivate our senior managing directors and other key personnel and to recruit, retain and motivate new senior managing directors and other key personnel, both of which could adversely affect our business, results and financial condition.\nOur most important asset is our people, and our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our senior managing directors and other professionals. Our future success and growth depend to a substantial degree on our ability to retain and motivate our senior managing directors and other key personnel and to strategically recruit, retain and motivate new talented personnel. Most of our current senior managing directors and other senior personnel have equity interests in our business that are primarily partnership units in Blackstone Holdings\n(as defined under \u201cPart III. Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence - Blackstone Holdings Partnership Agreements\u201d) and which entitle such personnel to cash distributions. However, the value of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units and other Blackstone equity interests, and the distributions in respect thereof, may not be sufficient to retain and motivate our senior managing directors and other key personnel, nor may they be sufficiently attractive to strategically recruit, retain and motivate new talented personnel.\nAdditionally, the retention of an increasingly larger portion of the Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units held by senior managing directors is not dependent upon their continued employment with us as those equity interests continue to vest as time passes. Moreover, the minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer restrictions to which these interests are subject in certain instances lapse over time, may not be enforceable in all cases and can be waived. There is no guarantee that the non-competition\nand non-solicitation\nagreements to which our senior managing directors are subject, together with our other arrangements with them, will prevent them from leaving us, joining our competitors or otherwise competing with us or that these agreements will be enforceable in all cases. In addition, these agreements will expire after a certain period of time, at which point each of our senior managing directors would be free to compete against us and solicit investors in our funds, clients and employees.\nWe might not be able to provide future senior managing directors with equity interests in our business to the same extent or with the same tax consequences from which our existing senior managing directors previously benefited. For example, U.S. Federal income tax law now generally imposes a three-year holding period requirement for carried interest to be treated as long-term capital gain. The holding period requirement may result in some of our carried interest being treated as ordinary income, which would materially increase the amount of taxes that our employees and other key personnel would be required to pay. Moreover, the tax treatment of carried interest may continue to be an area of focus for policymakers and government officials, which could result in further regulatory action by federal or state governments. See \u201c-Proposed changes in U.S. and foreign taxation of businesses could adversely affect us.\u201d For example, certain states, including New York and California, have proposed legislation to levy additional state tax on carried interest. In addition, certain states, such as New York, have proposed to temporarily increase the income tax rate for the state\u2019s highest earners, which could subject certain of our employees and personnel in New York City to the highest combined state-and-local\ntax rate in the United States. These and other changes to the tax treatment of carried interest and in applicable federal, state, local and other tax laws that may be enacted may adversely affect our ability to recruit, retain and motivate our current and future professionals.\nAlternatively, the value of the equity awards we may issue senior managing directors at any given time may subsequently fall (as reflected in the market price of common stock), which could counteract the incentives we are seeking to induce in them. Therefore, in order to recruit and retain existing and future senior managing directors, we may need to increase the level of compensation that we pay to them. Accordingly, as we promote or hire new senior managing directors over time, we may increase the level of compensation we pay to our senior managing directors, which would cause our total employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of our total revenue to increase and adversely affect our profitability. In addition, issuance of equity interests in our business in the future to senior managing directors and other personnel would dilute public common stockholders.\nWe strive to maintain a work environment that reinforces our culture of collaboration, motivation and alignment of interests with investors. If we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our changing enterprise and maintain this culture, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe asset management business is intensely competitive.\nThe asset management business is intensely competitive, with competition based on a variety of factors, including investment performance, the quality of service provided to clients, investor liquidity and willingness to invest, fund terms (including fees), brand recognition and business reputation. Our asset management business\ncompetes with a number of private equity funds, specialized investment funds, hedge funds, funds of hedge funds and other sponsors managing pools of capital, as well as corporate buyers, traditional asset managers, commercial banks, investment banks and other financial institutions (including sovereign wealth funds), and we expect that competition will continue to increase. For example, certain traditional asset managers have developed their own private equity platforms and are marketing other asset allocation strategies as alternatives to hedge fund investments. Additionally, developments in financial technology, or fintech, such as distributed ledger technology, or blockchain, have the potential to disrupt the financial industry and change the way financial institutions, as well as asset managers, do business. A number of factors serve to increase our competitive risks:\n\u2022\na number of our competitors in some of our businesses have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and more personnel than we do,\n\u2022\nsome of our funds may not perform as well as competitors\u2019 funds or other available investment products,\n\u2022\nseveral of our competitors have significant amounts of capital, and many of them have similar investment objectives to ours, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities and may reduce the size and duration of pricing inefficiencies that many alternative investment strategies seek to exploit,\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors, particularly strategic competitors, may have a lower cost of capital, which may be exacerbated to the extent potential changes to the Internal Revenue Code limit the deductibility of interest expense,\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors may have access to funding sources that are not available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to investment opportunities,\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors may be subject to less regulation and accordingly may have more flexibility to undertake and execute certain businesses or investments than we can and/or bear less compliance expense than we do,\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors may have more flexibility than us in raising certain types of investment funds under the investment management contracts they have negotiated with their investors,\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments that we want to make,\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors may be more successful than us in the development and implementation of new technology to address investor demand for product and strategy innovation, particularly in the hedge fund industry,\n\u2022\nthere are relatively few barriers to entry impeding new alternative asset fund management firms, and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various businesses, including former \u201cstar\u201d portfolio managers at large diversified financial institutions as well as such institutions themselves, is expected to continue to result in increased competition,\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors may have better expertise or be regarded by investors as having better expertise in a specific asset class or geographic region than we do,\n\u2022\nour competitors that are corporate buyers may be able to achieve synergistic cost savings in respect of an investment, which may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for an investment,\n\u2022\nsome investors may prefer to invest with an investment manager that is not publicly traded or is smaller with only one or two investment products that it manages, and\n\u2022\nother industry participants will from time to time seek to recruit our investment professionals and other employees away from us.\nWe may lose investment opportunities in the future if we do not match investment prices, structures and terms offered by competitors. Alternatively, we may experience decreased rates of return and increased risks of loss if we match investment prices, structures and terms offered by competitors. Moreover, if we are forced to compete with other alternative asset managers on the basis of price, we may not be able to maintain our current\nfund fee and carried interest terms. We have historically competed primarily on the performance of our funds, and not on the level of our fees or carried interest relative to those of our competitors. However, there is a risk that fees and carried interest in the alternative investment management industry will decline, without regard to the historical performance of a manager. Fee or carried interest income reductions on existing or future funds, without corresponding decreases in our cost structure, would adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nIn addition, the attractiveness of our investment funds relative to investments in other investment products could decrease depending on economic conditions. Furthermore, any new or incremental regulatory measures for the U.S. financial services industry may increase costs and create regulatory uncertainty and additional competition for many of our funds. See \u201c- Financial regulatory changes in the United States could adversely affect our business.\u201d\nThis competitive pressure could adversely affect our ability to make successful investments and limit our ability to raise future investment funds, either of which would adversely impact our business, revenue, results of operations and cash flow.\nOur organizational documents do not limit our ability to enter into new lines of businesses, and we may expand into new investment strategies, geographic markets and businesses, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our businesses.\nOur plan, to the extent that market conditions permit, is to continue to grow our investment businesses and expand into new investment strategies, geographic markets and businesses. Our organizational documents do not limit us to investment management businesses. Accordingly, we have pursued and may continue to pursue growth through acquisitions of asset managers and other investment management companies, acquisitions of critical business partners, or other strategic initiatives. To the extent we make strategic investments or acquisitions, undertake other strategic initiatives or enter into a new line of business, we will face numerous risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with (a) the required investment of capital and other resources, (b) the possibility that we have insufficient expertise to engage in such activities profitably or without incurring inappropriate amounts of risk, (c) the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core businesses, (d) assumption of liabilities in any acquired business, (e) the disruption of our ongoing businesses, (f) the increasing demands on or issues related to the combining or integrating operational and management systems and controls, (g) compliance with additional regulatory requirements and (h) the broadening of our geographic footprint, including the risks associated with conducting operations in non-U.S.\njurisdictions.\nEntry into certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar, or from which we are currently exempt, and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk. For example, we have increasingly undertaken business initiatives to offer registered investment products to retail investors. These activities have and will continue to impose additional compliance burdens on us and could also subject us to enhanced regulatory scrutiny and expose us to greater reputation and litigation risk. See \u201c- We have increasingly undertaken business initiatives to increase the number and type of investment products we offer to retail investors, which could expose us to new and greater levels of risk.\u201d In addition, if a new business generates insufficient revenues or if we are unable to efficiently manage our expanded operations, our results of operations will be adversely affected. Our strategic initiatives may include, among other things, initiatives seeking to expand our and our portfolio companies\u2019 data science capabilities, which require a robust legal and compliance framework, and entry into joint ventures, which may require us to be dependent on, and subject us to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to, systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control.\nIf we are unable to consummate or successfully integrate additional development opportunities, acquisitions or joint ventures, we may not be able to implement our growth strategy successfully.\nOur growth strategy is based, in part, on the selective development or acquisition of asset management businesses or other businesses complementary to our business where we think we can add substantial value or generate substantial returns. The success of this strategy will depend on, among other things: (a) the availability of suitable opportunities, (b) the level of competition from other companies that may have greater financial\nresources, (c) our ability to value potential development or acquisition opportunities accurately and negotiate acceptable terms for those opportunities, (d) our ability to obtain requisite approvals and licenses from the relevant governmental authorities and to comply with applicable laws and regulations without incurring undue costs and delays and (e) our ability to identify and enter into mutually beneficial relationships with venture partners. Moreover, even if we are able to identify and successfully complete an acquisition, we may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected costs associated with integrating and overseeing the operations of the new businesses. If we are not successful in implementing our growth strategy, our business, financial results and the market price for our common stock may be adversely affected.\nChanges in relevant tax laws, regulations or treaties or an adverse interpretation of these items by tax authorities could adversely impact our effective tax rate and tax liability.\nOur effective tax rate and tax liability is based on the application of current income tax laws, regulations and\ntreaties. These laws, regulations and treaties are complex, and the manner which they apply to us and our funds is\nsometimes open to interpretation. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for\nincome taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net\ndeferred tax assets. Although management believes its application of current laws, regulations and treaties to be\ncorrect and sustainable upon examination by the tax authorities, the tax authorities could challenge our interpretation resulting in additional tax liability or adjustment to our income tax provision that could increase our effective tax rate. Regarding the impact of the Conversion on our income taxes, see \u201cPart II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15. Income Taxes.\u201d\nProposed changes in U.S. and foreign taxation of businesses could adversely affect us.\nThe new administration has provided initial guidance on what U.S. tax law reforms the President would support. Among other things, this administration may pursue tax policies seeking to increase the corporate tax rate, limit further the deductibility of interest and subject carried interest to more onerous taxation. The likelihood of such tax changes being implemented is increased given the Democrat controlled U.S. Congress. Any such tax changes could materially increase the amount of taxes we, our portfolio companies and our investors would be required to pay. For example, increases in the corporate tax rate may adversely impact the cash flow of our portfolio companies and result in our funds selling those assets at values that are less than we projected, which would in turn have negative impact to the investment fund\u2019s performance and to the pace of realizations. Other changes that could be enacted in the future, including changes to tax laws enacted by state or local governments in jurisdictions in which we or our portfolio companies operate, could result in further changes to state and local taxation and materially adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nIn addition, the U.S. Congress, the Organization for Economic Co-operation\nand Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) and other government agencies in jurisdictions in which we and our affiliates invest or do business have maintained a focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational companies. The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, is contemplating changes to numerous long-standing tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d) project, which is focused on a number of issues, including the shifting of profits between affiliated entities in different tax jurisdictions, interest deductibility and eligibility for the benefits of double tax treaties. Several of the proposed measures are potentially relevant to some of our structures and could have an adverse tax impact on our funds, investors and/or our portfolio companies. Some member countries have been moving forward on the BEPS agenda but, because timing of implementation and the specific measures adopted will vary among participating states, significant uncertainty remains regarding the impact of BEPS proposals. If implemented, these proposals could result in a loss of tax treaty benefits and increased taxes on income from our investments.\nA number of European jurisdictions have enacted taxes on financial transactions, and the European Commission has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes under the so-called\n\u201cenhanced cooperation procedure,\u201d which provides for adoption of EU-level\nlegislation applicable to some but not all EU Member States. These contemplated changes, if adopted by individual countries, could increase tax uncertainty and/or costs faced by us, our funds\u2019 portfolio companies and our investors, change our business model and cause other adverse\nconsequences. The timing or impact of these proposals is unclear at this point. In addition, tax laws, regulations and interpretations are subject to continual changes, which could adversely affect our structures or returns to our investors. For instance, various countries have adopted or proposed tax legislation that may adversely affect portfolio companies and investment structures in countries in which our funds have invested and may limit the benefits of additional investments in those countries.\nChanges in U.S. and foreign tax law could adversely affect our ability to raise funds from certain foreign investors or increase our compliance or withholding tax costs.\nUnder the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (\u201cFATCA\u201d), all entities in a broadly defined class of foreign financial institutions (\u201cFFIs\u201d) are required to comply with a complicated and expansive reporting regime or be subject to a 30% United States withholding tax on certain U.S. payments, and non-U.S.\nentities which are not FFIs are required to either certify they have no substantial U.S. beneficial ownership or to report certain information with respect to their substantial U.S. beneficial ownership or be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax on certain U.S. payments. The reporting obligations imposed under FATCA require FFIs to enter into agreements with the IRS to obtain and disclose information about certain investors to the IRS. In addition, the administrative and economic costs of compliance with FATCA may discourage some foreign investors from investing in U.S. funds, which could adversely affect our ability to raise funds from these investors. Other countries such as Luxembourg, the U.K. and the Cayman Islands have implemented regimes similar to that of FATCA. For example, under an initiative known as Global FATCA, more than 100 OECD member countries have committed to automatic exchange of information relating to accounts held by tax residents of signatory countries, using a Common Reporting Standard (\u201cCRS\u201d). Compliance with such regimes could result in increased administrative and compliance costs and could subject our investment entities to increased withholding taxes.\nThe U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union may negatively impact the value of certain of our assets.\nFollowing Brexit, a new Trade and Cooperation Agreement (the \u201cTCA\u201d) between the U.K. and the EU was announced on December 24, 2020. The TCA addresses, among other things, trade in goods and the ability of U.K. nationals to travel to the EU on business, but does not address substantive future cooperation with respect to financial services or reciprocal market access under so-called\n\u201cequivalence\u201d arrangements. In addition, U.K. service suppliers no longer benefit from automatic access to the entire EU single market and free movement of goods is subject to increased bureaucracy. Although the TCA contains provisions on short-term business visits without visas or work permits, these are unlikely to cover provision of services and free movement between the EU and the U.K. The loss of these benefits, together with the ongoing uncertainty with respect to financial services under the TCA, could impact the attractiveness of the U.K. as a global business and financial center. Although the long-term impact of such changes, and of Brexit more broadly, is uncertain, Brexit may have an adverse effect on the rate of economic growth in the U.K. and Europe, which may negatively impact asset values in those regions. In addition, given the size and global significance of the U.K.\u2019s economy, ongoing uncertainty regarding its political and economic relationships with Europe may continue to be a source of instability in markets outside of the U.K. and Europe.\nBrexit has impacted Blackstone\u2019s European operations. The main impact has been on Blackstone\u2019s ability to market its products and services in the EEA. Following Brexit, Blackstone\u2019s U.K. subsidiary (BGIP) lost its ability to passport its services into Europe meaning it cannot market its products and services or conduct other regulated activity in EEA countries unless it has obtained a cross-border license or can operate pursuant to a licensing exemption. In jurisdictions where BGIP cannot offer products or services, Blackstone has transferred activities to its regulated European subsidiaries. These post-Brexit arrangements are complex and have resulted in increased operational and compliance burdens for Blackstone.\nIn addition, since the result of the Brexit referendum in mid-2016,\nthe British pound has experienced periods of weakness. Although Brexit\u2019s effectiveness has not had an immediate adverse impact on the British pound, a decline in its value may negatively affect the mark-to-market\nvaluations of our British pound-denominated investments. Weakness in the British pound may also contribute to volatility in other currencies, including the\neuro, which may negatively impact the mark-to-market\nvaluations of our euro denominated investments. Weakness or significant fluctuation in currency exchange rates may also adversely impact our financial results as a result of the conversion of investment principal and income from one currency into another.\nCybersecurity risks could result in the loss of data, interruptions in our business, and damage to our reputation, and subject us to regulatory actions, increased costs and financial losses, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur operations are highly dependent on our information systems and technology and we rely heavily on our financial, accounting, communications and other data processing systems. Our systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of tampering or a breach of our network security systems or otherwise. In addition, our systems face ongoing cybersecurity threats and attacks. Attacks on our systems could involve, and in some instances have in the past involved, attempts intended to obtain unauthorized access to our proprietary information, destroy data or disable, degrade or sabotage our systems, or divert or otherwise steal funds, including through the introduction of computer viruses, \u201cphishing\u201d attempts and other forms of social engineering. Cyberattacks and other security threats could originate from a wide variety of external sources, including cyber criminals, nation state hackers, hacktivists and other outside parties. Cyberattacks and other security threats could also originate from the malicious or accidental acts of insiders, such as employees.\nThere has been an increase in the frequency and sophistication of the cyber and security threats we face, with attacks ranging from those common to businesses generally to those that are more advanced and persistent, which may target us because, as an alternative asset management firm, we hold a significant amount of confidential and sensitive information about our investors, our portfolio companies and potential investments. As a result, we may face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption with respect to this information. There can be no assurance that measures we take to ensure the integrity of our systems will provide protection, especially because cyberattack techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until successful. If our systems are compromised, do not operate properly or are disabled, or we fail to provide the appropriate regulatory or other notifications in a timely manner, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to our investment funds and fund investors, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means.\nIn addition, we could also suffer losses in connection with updates to, or the failure to timely update, our information systems and technology. In addition, we have become increasingly reliant on third party service providers for certain aspects of our business, including for the administration of certain funds, as well as for certain information systems and technology, including cloud-based services. These third party service providers could also face ongoing cyber security threats and compromises of their systems and as a result, unauthorized individuals could gain, and in some past instances have gained, access to certain confidential data.\nCybersecurity has become a top priority for regulators around the world. Many jurisdictions in which we operate have laws and regulations relating to data privacy, cybersecurity and protection of personal information, including, as examples the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) in the European Union that went into effect in May 2018 and the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d). See \u201c- Rapidly developing and changing global privacy laws and regulations could increase compliance costs and subject us to enforcements risks and reputational damage.\u201d Some jurisdictions have also enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals and government agencies of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data.\nBreaches in security, whether malicious in nature or through inadvertent transmittal or other loss of data, could potentially jeopardize our, our employees\u2019 or our fund investors\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our employees\u2019, our fund investors\u2019, our counterparties\u2019 or third parties\u2019 business and operations, which could result in significant financial losses, increased costs, liability to our fund investors and other counterparties, regulatory intervention and reputational damage. Furthermore, if we fail to comply with the relevant laws and regulations or fail to provide the appropriate regulatory or other notifications of breach in a timely matter, it could result in regulatory investigations and penalties, which could lead to negative publicity and reputational harm and may cause our fund investors and clients to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures.\nOur portfolio companies also rely on data processing systems and the secure processing, storage and transmission of information, including payment and health information. A disruption or compromise of these systems could have a material adverse effect on the value of these businesses. Our funds may invest in strategic assets having a national or regional profile or in infrastructure, the nature of which could expose them to a greater risk of being subject to a terrorist attack or security breach than other assets or businesses. Such an event may have material adverse consequences on our investment or assets of the same type or may require portfolio companies to increase preventative security measures or expand insurance coverage.\nFinally, our technology, data and intellectual property and the technology, data and intellectual property of our portfolio companies are also subject to a heightened risk of theft or compromise to the extent we and our portfolio companies engage in operations outside the United States, in particular in those jurisdictions that do not have comparable levels of protection of proprietary information and assets such as intellectual property, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how\nand customer information and records. In addition, we and our portfolio companies may be required to compromise protections or forego rights to technology, data and intellectual property in order to operate in or access markets in a foreign jurisdiction. Any such direct or indirect compromise of these assets could have a material adverse impact on us and our portfolio companies.\nRapidly developing and changing global privacy laws and regulations could increase compliance costs and subject us to enforcement risks and reputational damage.\nWe and our portfolio companies are subject to various risks and costs associated with the collection, processing, storage and transmission of personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) and other sensitive and confidential information. This data is wide ranging and relates to our investors, employees, contractors and other counterparties and third parties. Our compliance obligations include those relating to U.S. laws such as the CCPA, which provides for enhanced consumer protections for California residents, a private right of action for data breaches and statutory fines and damages for data breaches or other CCPA violations, as well as a requirement of \u201creasonable\u201d cybersecurity. Our compliance obligations also include those relating to foreign data collection and privacy laws, including, for example, the GDPR in Europe, the Japanese Personal Information Protection Act, the Hong Kong Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, the Australian Privacy Act and the Brazilian Bank Secrecy Law. Global laws in this area are rapidly increasing in the scale and depth of their requirements, and are also often extra-territorial in nature. In addition, a wide range of regulators are seeking to enforce these laws across regions and borders. Furthermore, we frequently have privacy compliance requirements as a result of our contractual obligations with counterparties. These legal and contractual obligations heighten our privacy obligations in the ordinary course of conducting our business in the U.S. and internationally.\nWhile we have taken various measures and made significant efforts and investment to ensure that our policies, processes and systems are both robust and compliant with these obligations, our potential liability remains, particularly given the continued and rapid development of privacy laws and regulations around the world, and increased enforcement action. Any inability, or perceived inability, by us or our portfolio companies to adequately address privacy concerns, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards and guidance, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations, even if unfounded, could result in significant regulatory and third party liability, increased costs, disruption of our and our portfolio companies\u2019 business and operations, and a loss of client (including investor) confidence and other reputational damage. Furthermore, as new privacy-related laws and regulations are implemented, the time and resources needed for us and our portfolio companies to comply with such laws and regulations continues to increase and become a significant compliance workstream.\nOur operations are highly dependent on the information system and technology infrastructure that supports our business.\nWe depend on our headquarters in New York City, where many of our personnel are located, for the continued operation of our business. A disaster or a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses, as a result of a cybersecurity incident or otherwise, including a disruption involving electronic communications or other services used by us or third parties with whom we conduct business, or directly affecting our headquarters, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption. Our disaster recovery and business continuity programs may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption. In addition, insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses, if at all.\nOur operations are highly dependent on our information systems and technology and we rely heavily on our financial, accounting, communications and other data processing systems, each of which may require update and enhancement as we grow our business. Our information systems and technology may not continue to be able to accommodate our growth, and the cost of maintaining such systems may increase from its current level. Such a failure to adapt to or accommodate growth, or an increase in costs related to such information systems, could have a material adverse effect on us. Further, the majority of our employees globally have been working remotely in accordance with local government guidance and social distancing recommendations related to the Covid-19\npandemic. An extended period of remote working by our employees could introduce operational risks, including heightened cybersecurity risk.\nIn addition, we have become increasingly reliant on third party service providers for certain aspects of our business, including for the administration of certain funds, as well as for certain information systems and technology, including cloud-based services. In addition to the fact that these third party service providers could also face ongoing cyber security threats and compromises of their systems, we generally have less control over the delivery of such third party services, and as a result, we may face disruptions to our ability to operate a business as a result of interruptions of such services. Any interruption or deterioration in the performance of these third parties or failures or compromises of their information systems and technology could impair the operations of us and our funds and adversely affect our reputation and businesses. See \u201c- Cybersecurity risks could result in the loss of data, interruptions in our business, and damage to our reputation, and subject us to regulatory actions, increased costs and financial losses, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations\u201d and \u201c- Rapidly developing and changing global privacy laws and regulations could increase compliance costs and subject us to enforcement risks and reputational damage.\u201d\nExtensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties. The possibility of increased regulatory focus, particularly given a new administration, could result in additional burdens on our business.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation, including periodic examinations, by governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. These authorities have regulatory powers dealing with many aspects of financial services, including the authority to grant, and in specific circumstances to cancel, permissions to carry on particular activities. Many of these regulators, including U.S. and foreign government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the United States, are also empowered to conduct investigations and administrative proceedings that can result in fines, suspensions of personnel, changes in policies, procedures or disclosure or other sanctions, including censure, the issuance of cease-and-desist\norders, the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer or investment adviser from registration or memberships or the commencement of a civil or criminal lawsuit against us or our personnel. Moreover, the financial services industry in recent years has been the subject of heightened scrutiny, and the SEC has specifically focused on private equity. In that connection, in recent years the SEC\u2019s stated examination priorities have included, among other things, private equity firms\u2019 collection of fees and allocation of expenses, their marketing and valuation practices, allocation of investment opportunities and policies and procedures with respect to conflicts of interest. We regularly are subject to requests for information and informal or formal\ninvestigations by the SEC and other regulatory authorities, with which we routinely cooperate, and which have included review of historical practices that were previously examined. Such investigations have previously and may in the future result in penalties and other sanctions. SEC actions and initiatives can have an adverse effect on our financial results, including as a result of the imposition of a sanction, a limitation on our or our personnel\u2019s activities, or changing our historic practices. Even if an investigation or proceeding did not result in a sanction or the sanction imposed against us or our personnel by a regulator were small in monetary amount, the adverse publicity relating to the investigation, proceeding or imposition of these sanctions could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing clients or fail to gain new clients.\nWe rely on complex exemptions from statutes in conducting our asset management activities.\nWe regularly rely on exemptions from various requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), the Exchange Act, the 1940 Act, the Commodity Exchange Act and the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, in conducting our asset management activities. These exemptions are sometimes highly complex and may in certain circumstances depend on compliance by third parties whom we do not control. If for any reason these exemptions were to become unavailable to us, we could become subject to regulatory action or third party claims and our business could be materially and adversely affected. For example, the \u201cbad actor\u201d disqualification provisions of Rule 506 of Regulation D under the Securities Act ban an issuer from offering or selling securities pursuant to the safe harbor rule in Rule 506 if the issuer or any other \u201ccovered person\u201d is the subject of a criminal, regulatory or court order or other \u201cdisqualifying event\u201d under the rule which has not been waived. The definition of \u201ccovered person\u201d includes an issuer\u2019s directors, general partners, managing members and executive officers; affiliates who are also issuing securities in the offering; beneficial owners of 20% or more of the issuer\u2019s outstanding equity securities; and promoters and persons compensated for soliciting investors in the offering. Accordingly, our ability to rely on Rule 506 to offer or sell securities would be impaired if we or any \u201ccovered person\u201d is the subject of a disqualifying event under the rule and we are unable to obtain a waiver. The requirements imposed by our regulators are designed primarily to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect investors in our investment funds and are not designed to protect our common stockholders. Consequently, these regulations often serve to limit our activities and impose burdensome compliance requirements.\nFinancial regulatory changes in the United States could adversely affect our business.\nThe financial services industry continues to be the subject of heightened regulatory scrutiny in the United States. There has been active debate over the appropriate extent of regulation and oversight of private investment funds and their managers. We may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised regulations imposed by the SEC or other U.S. governmental regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets. We also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by these governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations. Further, new regulations or interpretations of existing laws may result in enhanced disclosure obligations, including with respect to climate change or ESG, which could negatively affect us or our portfolio companies and materially increase our regulatory burden. Increased regulations generally increase our costs, and we could continue to experience higher costs if new laws require us to spend more time, hire additional personnel, or buy new technology to comply effectively.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), enacted in July 2010, imposed significant changes on almost every aspect of the U.S. financial services industry, including aspects of our business, which include, without limitation, protection and compensation of whistleblowers, credit risk retention rules for certain sponsors of asset-backed securities, strengthening the oversight and supervision of the OTC derivatives and securities markets, as well as creating the Financial Stability Oversight Counsel (\u201cFSOC\u201d), an interagency body charged with identifying and monitoring systemic risk to financial markets. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, whistleblowers who voluntarily provide original information to the SEC can receive compensation and protection. The Dodd-Frank Act established a fund to be used to pay whistleblowers who will be entitled to receive a payment equal to between 10% and 30% of certain monetary sanctions imposed in a successful government action resulting from the information provided by the whistleblower. According to a recent annual report to the\nU.S. Congress on the Dodd-Frank Whistleblower Program, whistleblower claims have increased significantly since the enactment of these provisions and in 2020 the SEC awarded its highest ever award of $114 million to one whistleblower. Addressing such claims could generate significant expenses and take up significant management time for us and our portfolio companies, even if such claims are frivolous or without merit.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also authorized federal regulatory agencies to review and, in certain cases, prohibit compensation arrangements at financial institutions that give employees incentives to engage in conduct deemed to encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions. On May 16, 2016, the SEC re-proposed\na rule, as part of a joint rulemaking effort with U.S. federal banking regulators that would apply to \u201ccovered financial institutions,\u201d including registered investment advisers and broker-dealers that have total consolidated assets of at least $1 billion, and would impose substantive and procedural requirements on incentive-based compensation arrangements. While this proposed rule was never adopted, if efforts are revived to finalize the rule under the current administration the application of this rule to us could limit our ability to recruit and retain senior managing directors and investment professionals.\nRule 206(4)-5\nunder the Advisers Act prohibits investment advisers from providing advisory services for compensation to a government plan investor for two years, subject to limited exceptions, after the investment adviser, its senior executives or its personnel involved in soliciting investments from government entities make political contributions to certain candidates and officials in position to influence the hiring of an investment adviser by such government client. Advisers are required to implement compliance policies designed, among other matters, to comply with this rule. Any failure on our part to comply with the rule could expose us to significant penalties and reputational damage. In addition, there have been similar rules on a state level regarding \u201cpay to play\u201d practices by investment advisers.\nOn June 30, 2020, the SEC adopted a package of rulemakings and interpretations that address the standards of conduct and disclosure obligations applicable to investment advisers and broker-dealers. Among other things, the SEC published an interpretation of the standard of conduct for investment advisers, and adopted \u201cRegulation Best Interest,\u201d which is designed to enhance the existing standard of conduct for broker-dealers and natural persons who are associated persons of a broker-dealer when recommending to a retail customer any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities. Regulation Best Interest imposes a \u201cbest interest\u201d standard of care for broker-dealers and requires them to evaluate available alternatives, including, if available, alternatives that may have lower expenses and/or lower investment risk than our investment funds. The impact of Regulation Best Interest on broker-dealers participating in the offering of our investment funds cannot be determined at this time, but it may negatively impact whether broker-dealers and their associated persons are willing to recommend investment products, including our investment funds, to retail customers. As such, Regulation Best Interest may reduce the ability of our investment funds to raise capital, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, several states have taken actions to impose new conduct standards for investment advisers and broker-dealers operating in these states. These state conduct standards and any other proposed state laws or regulations may result in additional requirements related to our business. Further, on December 15, 2020, the U.S. Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d) issued a new final prohibited transaction class exemption (the \u201cExemption\u201d) for investment advice fiduciaries that is intended to align with Regulation Best Interest. However, under the new administration, the DOL\u2019s Exemption has been frozen, and the DOL, and possibly the SEC, may revisit the Exemption and Regulation Best Interest and may impose additional regulatory burdens. Depending on how Regulation Best Interest and the associated rulemakings are implemented and interpreted and whether the DOL or the various states impose any additional rules governing the conduct of investment advisers and broker-dealers, any such rules or regulations could have an adverse effect on the distribution of our products to certain investors.\nAny changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our business, including the changes described above, may impose additional compliance and other costs, increase regulatory investigations of the investment activities of our funds, require the attention of our senior management, affect the manner in which we conduct our business and adversely affect our profitability. The full extent of the impact on us of the Dodd-Frank Act or any other new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed, including by the new administration, is impossible to determine.\nThe potential for governmental policy and/or legislative changes and regulatory reform as a result of the recent U.S. Presidential and Congressional elections may create regulatory uncertainty for our investment strategies, may make it more difficult to operate our business, and may adversely affect the profitability of our funds\u2019 portfolio companies.\nGovernmental policy and/or legislative changes and regulatory reform could make it more difficult for us to operate our business, including by impeding fundraising, making certain equity or credit investments or investment strategies unattractive or less profitable. In addition, our ability to identify business and other risks associated with new investments depends in part on our ability to anticipate and accurately assess regulatory, legislative and other changes that may have a material impact on the businesses in which we choose to invest. We may face particular difficulty anticipating policy changes and reforms during periods of heightened partisanship at the federal, state and local levels, including due to the divisiveness surrounding populist movements, political disputes and socioeconomic issues. The failure to accurately anticipate the possible outcome of such changes and/or reforms could have a material adverse effect on the returns generated from our funds\u2019 investments and our revenues.\nIn addition, the change in administration has led and will lead to leadership changes at a number of U.S. federal regulatory agencies with oversight over the U.S. financial services industry. This poses uncertainty with respect to such agencies\u2019 policy priorities and may lead to increased regulatory enforcement activity in the financial services industry. Leadership and policy changes could also affect various industries in which our portfolio companies operate, including healthcare, energy and consumer finance. Although there is a substantial lack of clarity regarding the likelihood, timing and details of potential changes or reforms by the new administration and Democrat controlled U.S. Congress, such changes or reforms may impose additional costs on the companies in which we have invested or choose to invest in the future, require the attention of senior management or result in limitations on the manner in which the companies in which we have invested or choose to invest in the future conduct business. Such changes or reforms may include, without limitation:\n\u2022\nIn July 2019, proposed legislation was introduced into the U.S. Congress that contains a number of provisions that, if they were to become law, would adversely impact alternative asset management firms. Among other things, the bill would: potentially expose private funds and certain holders of economic interests therein to the liabilities of portfolio companies, require private funds to offer identical terms and benefits to all limited partners, require disclosure of names of each limited partner invested in a private fund, as well as sensitive fund-and\nportfolio company-level information, impose a limitation on the deductibility of interest expense only applicable to companies owned by private funds, modify settled bankruptcy law to target transactions by private equity funds, increase tax rates on carried interest, and prohibit portfolio companies from paying dividends or repurchasing their shares during the first two years following the acquisition of the portfolio company. If the proposed bill, or other similar legislation, were to become law under the new administration and Democrat controlled U.S. Congress, it would adversely affect us, our portfolio companies and our investors.\n\u2022\nThere has been recurring consideration amongst regulators and intergovernmental institutions regarding the role of nonbank institutions in providing credit and, particularly, so-called\n\u201cshadow banking,\u201d a term generally taken to refer to credit intermediation involving entities and activities outside the regulated banking system. Federal regulators, such as the Federal Reserve, and international organizations, such as the Financial Stability Board, are studying risks associated with nonbank lending. At this time, it is too early to assess whether any rules or regulations will be proposed or to what extent any finalized rules or regulations will have on the nonbank lending market. If nonbank lending became subject to similar regulations or oversight as traditional banks, our nonbank lending business would be adversely affected and the regulatory burden would be materially greater, which could adversely impact the implementation of our investment strategy and our returns.\n\u2022\nIn the United States, the FSOC has the authority to designate nonbank financial companies as systemically important financial institutions (\u201cSIFIs\u201d). Currently, there are no nonbank financial companies with a SIFI designation. The FSOC has, however, designated certain nonbank financial companies as SIFIs in the past, and additional nonbank financial companies, which may include large asset management companies such as us, may be designated as SIFIs in the future. The FSOC\u2019s most recent statements and actions generally indicate that it is focused on products and activities, rather than designation of entities, in its review of nonbank financial companies for potential SIFI designation, and has reviewed the asset management industry in particular. On December 4, 2019, the FSOC issued final guidance regarding procedures for designating nonbank financial companies as SIFIs, which included shifting from an \u201centity-based\u201d approach to an \u201cactivities-based\u201d approach whereby the FSOC will primarily focus on regulating activities that pose systemic risk to the financial stability of the United States, rather than designations of individual firms. Future reviews by the FSOC of nonbank financial companies for designation as SIFIs may focus on other types of products and activities, such as nonbank lending activities conducted by certain of our businesses.\nIf we were designated as a SIFI, including as a result of our asset management or nonbank lending activities, we could become subject to direct supervision by the Federal Reserve System, and could become subject to enhanced prudential, capital, supervisory and other requirements, such as risk-based capital requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements, resolution plan and credit exposure report requirements, concentration limits, a contingent capital requirement, enhanced public disclosures, short-term debt limits and overall risk management requirements. Requirements such as these, which were designed to regulate banking institutions, would likely need to be modified to be applicable to an asset manager, although no proposals have been made indicating how such measures would be adapted for asset managers.\n\u2022\n2020 saw a marked increase in the use of special purpose acquisition vehicle (\u201cSPAC\u201d) offerings and transactions, including by certain of our funds to create exit opportunities for our portfolio companies in lieu of a traditional IPO. SPAC transactions are currently exempt from rules adopted by the SEC to protect investors from blank check companies, such as Rule 419 under the Securities Act. Additionally, the safe harbor for forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act that generally applies to statements made by SEC registrants expressly does not apply to statements \u201cmade in connection with initial public offering[s],\u201d but the same constraints do not apply to de-SPAC\ntransactions. However, the SEC may modify existing regulations or adopt new rules relating to SPAC transactions, which could impact our ability to use SPAC transactions as a means to exit investments.\nOngoing trade negotiations and related government actions may create regulatory uncertainty for our portfolio companies and our investment strategies and adversely affect the profitability of our portfolio companies.\nSince 2018, the U.S. has imposed various tariffs on Chinese goods, including aluminum and steel, and China has retaliated by placing tariffs on various U.S. goods. While both countries signed a preliminary trade agreement in January 2020 halting further tariffs and increasing sales of U.S. goods to China, the agreement leaves in place most tariffs on Chinese goods. The final outcome of the negotiations and agreements is not possible to predict, particularly as a result of the change in administration in the U.S. Furthermore, in 2020 the U.S. implemented or expanded a number of economic sanctions programs and export controls that specifically targeted Chinese entities and nationals on national security grounds, including, for example, with respect to China\u2019s response to political demonstrations in Hong Kong and China\u2019s conduct concerning the treatment of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in its Xinjiang province. China has responded by imposing sanctions against certain U.S. nationals engaged in political activities relating to Hong Kong. Further escalation of the \u201ctrade war\u201d between the U.S. and China, the countries\u2019 inability to reach further trade agreements, or the continued use of reciprocal sanctions by each country, may negatively impact the rate of global growth, particularly in China, which has and continues to exhibit signs of slowing growth. Such slowing growth could adversely affect the revenues and profitability of our funds\u2019 portfolio companies.\nIn December 2019, the U.S., Mexico and Canada signed the amended United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (the \u201cUSMCA\u201d), which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement. The impact that the USMCA will have on us and our portfolio companies is difficult to predict.\nThere is uncertainty as to the actions that may be taken under the new administration with respect to U.S. trade policy with China and the USMCA. Further governmental actions related to the imposition of tariffs or other trade barriers or changes to international trade agreements or policies, could further increase costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of products and services offered by current and future portfolio companies and adversely affect the revenues and profitability of companies whose businesses rely on goods imported from outside of the U.S.\nFinancial deregulation measures may create regulatory uncertainty for the financial sector, increase competition in certain of our investment strategies and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cReform Act\u201d) was signed into law. Among other financial regulatory changes, the Reform Act amends various sections of the Dodd-Frank Act, including by modifying the Volcker Rule to exempt certain insured depository institutions. In 2019, U.S. federal regulatory agencies adopted (a) amendments to the Volcker Rule regulations to implement the Volcker Rule amendments included in the Reform Act and (b) certain targeted amendments to the Volcker Rule regulations to simplify and tailor certain compliance requirements relating to the Volcker Rule. In June 2020, U.S. federal regulatory agencies adopted additional revisions to the Volcker Rule\u2019s current restrictions on banking entities sponsoring and investing in certain covered hedge funds and private equity funds, including by adopting new exemptions allowing banking entities to sponsor and invest without limit in credit funds, venture capital funds, customer facilitation funds and family wealth management vehicles (the \u201cCovered Fund Amendments\u201d). The Covered Fund Amendments also loosen certain other restrictions on extraterritorial fund activities and direct parallel or co-investments\nmade alongside covered funds. The Covered Fund Amendments should therefore expand the ability of banking entities to invest in and sponsor private funds. The Covered Fund Amendments, the Reform Act and similar regulatory developments may have the effect of increasing competition for our businesses. For example, increased competition from banks and other financial institutions in the credit markets could have the effect of reducing credit spreads, which may adversely affect the revenues of our credit and other businesses whose strategies include the provision of credit to borrowers.\nTo date, the new administration has not expressed an intent to implement measures focused on deregulation of the U.S. financial services industry, and has taken actions seeking to halt or reverse certain deregulation measures adopted by the prior administration. However, whether the new administration or regulatory agencies will enact, adopt or modify any particular financial regulations remains unclear. Any changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our business or the businesses of the portfolio companies of our funds, including the changes described above, may create uncertainty, require the attention of our senior management or result in limitations on the manner in which business is conducted, or may ultimately have an adverse impact on the competitiveness of certain nonbank financial service providers vis-\u00e0-vis\ntraditional banking organizations.\nWe and our affiliates from time to time are required to report specified dealings or transactions involving Iran or other sanctioned individuals or entities.\nThe Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (\u201cITRA\u201d) expands the scope of U.S. sanctions against Iran. Additionally, Section 219 of the ITRA amended the Exchange Act to require companies subject to SEC reporting obligations under Section 13 of the Exchange Act to disclose in their periodic reports specified dealings or transactions involving Iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain OFAC sanctions engaged in by the reporting company or any of its affiliates during the period covered by the relevant periodic report. In some cases, ITRA requires companies to disclose these types of transactions even if they were permissible under U.S. law. Companies that currently may be or may have been at the time considered our affiliates have from time to time publicly filed and/or provided to us the disclosures reproduced on Exhibit 99.1 of our Quarterly Reports. We do not independently verify or participate in the preparation of these disclosures. We are required to separately\nfile with the SEC a notice when such activities have been disclosed in this report, and the SEC is required to post such notice of disclosure on its website and send the report to the President and certain U.S. Congressional committees. The President thereafter is required to initiate an investigation and, within 180 days of initiating such an investigation, determine whether sanctions should be imposed. Disclosure of such activity, even if such activity is not subject to sanctions under applicable law, and any sanctions actually imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities, could harm our reputation and have a negative impact on our business, and any failure to disclose any such activities as required could additionally result in fines or penalties.\nWe are subject to increasing scrutiny from certain investors with respect to the environmental, social and governance impact of investments made by our funds, which may constrain capital deployment opportunities for our funds and adversely impact our ability to raise capital from such investors.\nIn recent years, certain investors, including public pension funds, have placed increasing importance on the negative impacts of investments made by the private equity and other funds to which they commit capital, including with respect to environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters. Certain investors have also demonstrated increased activism with respect to existing investments, including by urging asset managers to take certain actions that could adversely impact the value of an investment, or refrain from taking certain actions that could improve the value of an investment. At times, investors have conditioned future capital commitments on the taking or refraining from taking of such actions. Increased focus and activism related to ESG and similar matters may constrain our capital deployment opportunities, and the demands of certain investors, including public pension funds, may further limit the types of investments that are available to our funds. In addition, investors, including public pension funds, which represent a significant portion of our funds\u2019 investor bases, may decide to withdraw previously committed capital from our funds (where such withdrawal is permitted) or to not commit capital to future fundraises as a result of their assessment of our approach to and consideration of the social cost of investments made by our funds. To the extent our access to capital from investors, including public pension funds, is impaired, we may not be able to maintain or increase the size of our funds or raise sufficient capital for new funds, which may adversely impact our revenues.\nIn addition, ESG matters have been the subject of increased focus by certain regulators in the U.S. and the EU. See \u201c- Financial regulatory changes in the United States could adversely affect our business\u201d and \u201c- Regulatory changes in jurisdictions outside the United States could adversely affect our business.\u201d As a result of these legislative initiatives, we may be required to provide additional disclosure to investors in our funds with respect to ESG matters.\nRegulatory changes in jurisdictions outside the United States could adversely affect our business.\nSimilar to the United States, the jurisdictions outside the United States in which we operate, in particular Europe, have become subject to further regulation. Governmental regulators and other authorities in Europe have proposed or implemented a number of initiatives and additional rules and regulations that could adversely affect our business. Increasingly, the rules and regulations in the financial sector in Europe are becoming more prescriptive. Rules and regulations in other jurisdictions are often informed by key features of U.S. and European rules and regulations and, as a result, our businesses outside of these jurisdictions, including across Asia, may become subject to increased regulation in the future.\nIn Europe, the AIFM Law was implemented in 2013 and established a regulatory regime for alternative investment fund managers, including private equity and hedge fund managers. The AIFM Law is applicable to our AIFM in Luxembourg and Ireland. We have had to comply with these and other requirements of the AIFM Law in order to market certain of our investment funds to professional investors in the EEA. Following Brexit, the U.K. has \u201con-shored\u201d\nrelevant European legislation. On-shoring\nis the process of amending EU legislation and regulatory requirements so that these apply in a U.K.-only context. The U.K. has on-shored\nthe AIFM Law and therefore similar requirements continue to apply to BGIP and U.K. funds notwithstanding Brexit.\nIn addition, a June 2020 report on the application and scope of the AIFM Law is expected to result in a legislative proposal (commonly referred to as \u201cAIFMD II\u201d) that may increase the cost of doing business for our AIFM in Luxembourg and our non-EEA\nAIFMs looking to market in the EEA. Our funds may become disadvantaged in attracting certain investors that are located in EEA member states as compared to non-AIFM\ncompetitors that may not be subject to such requirements. As a result, compliance with AIFMD II has the potential to increase the cost and complexity of raising capital and consequently may slow the pace of fundraising.\nThe EU Securitization Regulation (the \u201cSecuritization Regulation\u201d), which became effective on January 1, 2019, imposes due diligence and risk retention requirements on \u201cinstitutional investors\u201d (which includes managers of alternative investment funds assets) which must be satisfied prior to holding a securitization position, and constrains the ability of alternative investment funds to invest in securitization positions that do not comply with, among other things, the prescribed risk retention requirements. These requirements may apply to AIFs managed by not only EU AIFMs but also non-EU\nAIFMs where those AIFs have been registered for marketing in the EU under Article 42 of the AIFM Law. Given the expanded breadth of the revised regulation, this may impact or limit our funds\u2019 ability to make certain investments that constitute \u201csecuritizations\u201d under the Securitization Regulation. The U.K. has on-shored\nthe EU Securitization Regulation and therefore similar requirements continue to apply in the U.K. notwithstanding Brexit.\nThe EU Regulation on over-the-counter\n(\u201cOTC\u201d) derivative transactions, central counterparties and trade repositories (the \u201cEuropean Market Infrastructure Regulation\u201d or \u201cEMIR\u201d) requires the mandatory clearing of certain OTC derivatives through central counterparties, creates additional risk mitigation requirements (including, in particular, margining requirements) in respect of certain OTC derivative transactions that are not cleared by a central counterparty and imposes reporting and record keeping requirements in respect of most derivative transactions. The requirements are similar to, but not the same as, those in Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. The U.K. has on-shored\nEMIR and a similar but not identical set of rules therefore now apply in the U.K. notwithstanding Brexit. Certain cross-border arrangements (such as those where a Blackstone European fund enters into derivatives transactions with a U.K. counterparty, transacts on a U.K. trading venue or clears its derivatives through a U.K. clearing house) may be impacted. Compliance with the relevant requirements in the EU and the U.K. (as applicable) is likely to continue to increase the administrative burdens and costs of doing business.\nEuropean regulation, in particular MiFID II, requires, among other things, all MiFID investment firms, including private equity and hedge fund managers, to comply with more prescriptive disclosure, transparency, reporting and recordkeeping obligations and enhanced obligations in relation to the receipt of investment research, best execution, product governance and marketing communications. The U.K. has on-shored\nMiFID and therefore similar requirements continue to apply in the U.K. notwithstanding Brexit. Compliance with MiFID II has resulted in greater overall complexity, higher compliance and administration and operational costs and less overall flexibility.\nAs with any other organization that holds personal data of EU data subjects, we are required to comply with the GDPR because, among other things, we process European individuals\u2019 personal data in the U.S. via our global technology systems. Financial regulators and data protection authorities throughout the EU have significantly increased audit and investigatory powers under GDPR to probe how personal data is being used and processed. Serious breaches of GDPR include antitrust-like fines on companies of up to the greater of \u20ac\n20 million or 4% of global group turnover in the preceding year, regulatory action and reputational risk. See \u201c- Rapidly developing and changing global privacy laws and regulations could increase compliance costs and subject us to enforcement risks and reputational damage.\u201d The U.K. has on-shored\nGDPR and similar requirements therefore continue to apply in the U.K. notwithstanding Brexit. The TCA provides for a transitional period during which transfers of personal data from the EU to the U.K. will not be considered as transfers to a third country under EU GDPR. If this transitional period ends without the European Commission adopting an adequacy decision in relation to the U.K., transfers of personal data from the EU to the U.K. will be subject to additional requirements under the EU GDPR rules on exporting data outside the EU.\nA new EU Regulation (\u201cIFR/IFD\u201d) on the prudential requirements of investment firms will come into effect on June 26, 2021 and introduce a prudential regime for most MiFID investment. These new regimes may result in higher capital requirements for our MiFID firms, more onerous remuneration rules and enhanced internal governance, disclosure, reporting, liquidity and consolidation requirements.\nThe new EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (\u201cSFDR\u201d) requires MiFID firms and AIFMs to take into account sustainability and environmental, social and governance factors in their organizational (including remuneration), risk and governance arrangements, and to make certain public disclosures regarding their approach to those factors. The majority of these requirements are expected to come into effect in the EU on March 10, 2021, and will affect our EEA operations, including to a certain extent where non-EU\nfunds or other products are provided to clients or investors in the EU. Uncertainty as to the detail and scope of these rules remains, but in particular there is a risk that additional data may need to be collected and disclosed in the future, which could increase the compliance burden and costs for our European operations and/or funds.\nIn addition, on June 22, 2020, a regulation on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment was published in the Official Journal of the European Union (the \u201cTaxonomy Regulation\u201d). The Taxonomy Regulation sets out a framework for classifying economic activities as \u201cenvironmentally sustainable\u201d and also introduces certain mandatory disclosure and reporting requirements (which supplement those set out in SFDR) for financial products which have an environmental sustainable investment objective or which promote environmental characteristics. The Taxonomy Regulation is due to take effect in part from January 2022 and in part from January 2023. Complying with these new rules (or, in the case of future U.K. legislative or regulatory initiatives, revised or existing rules which diverge from those in force in the EEA) may create additional compliance burden and cost for Blackstone and funds managed by Blackstone.\nWhile the U.K. is not expected to implement equivalent legislative initiatives, it has signaled an intention to introduce a new legislative framework focused on implementing the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (\u201cTCFD\u201d), in particular by introducing mandatory TCFD-aligned disclosure requirements for U.K. firms. This framework is still in development and will be subject to a phased implementation, and is therefore not expected to begin to apply to the asset management sector until 2022 at the earliest. It is unclear at this stage what impact this new regime will have on our business.\nWe are subject to substantial litigation risks and may face significant liabilities and damage to our professional reputation as a result of litigation allegations and negative publicity.\nIn recent years, the volume of claims and amount of damages claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against the financial services industry in general have been increasing. The investment decisions we make in our asset management business and the activities of our investment professionals in connection with portfolio companies may subject the companies, funds and us to the risk of third party litigation arising from investor dissatisfaction with the performance of those investment funds, alleged conflicts of interest, the suitability or manner of distribution of our products, including to retail investors, the activities of our funds\u2019 portfolio companies and a variety of other litigation claims. From time to time we, our funds and our funds\u2019 public portfolio companies have been and may be subject to securities class action lawsuits by stockholders, as well as class action lawsuits that challenge our acquisition transactions and/or attempt to enjoin them. Please see \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d for a discussion of a certain proceeding to which we are currently a party.\nIn addition, to the extent investors in our investment funds suffer losses resulting from fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or other similar misconduct, investors may have remedies against us, our investment funds, our senior managing directors or our affiliates under the federal securities law and/or state law. While the general partners and investment advisers to our investment funds, including their directors, officers, other employees and affiliates, are generally indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by law with respect to their conduct in connection with the management of the business and affairs of our investment funds, such indemnity does not extend to actions determined to have involved fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or other similar misconduct.\nThe activities of our capital markets services business may also subject us to the risk of liabilities to our clients and third parties, including our clients\u2019 stockholders, under securities or other laws in connection with transactions in which we participate.\nAny private lawsuits or regulatory actions brought against us and resulting in a finding of substantial legal liability could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could seriously harm our business. We depend to a large extent on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain investors and to pursue investment opportunities for our funds. As a result, allegations of improper conduct by private litigants, regulators, or employees, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us, our investment activities, our lines of business or distribution channels, our workplace environment, or the asset management industry in general, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation, which may be more damaging to our business than to other types of businesses. The pervasiveness of social media, coupled with increased public focus on the externalities of business activities, could further magnify the reputational risks associated with negative publicity.\nEmployee misconduct could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subjecting us to significant legal liability and reputational harm. Fraud and other deceptive practices or other misconduct at our funds\u2019 portfolio companies could similarly subject us to liability and reputational damage and also harm performance.\nOur employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. We are subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our asset management business and our authority over the assets managed by our asset management business. The violation of these obligations and standards by any of our employees would adversely affect our clients and us. Our business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to companies in which we may invest. If our employees were to improperly use or disclose confidential information, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position and current and future business relationships. Detecting or deterring employee misconduct is not always possible, and the extensive precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases. If one of our employees were to engage in misconduct or were to be accused of such misconduct, our business and our reputation could be adversely affected.\nIn recent years, the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC have devoted greater resources to enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d). In addition, the U.K. has also significantly expanded the reach of its anti-bribery laws. Local jurisdictions, such as Brazil, have also brought a greater focus to anti-bribery laws. While we have developed and implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure strict compliance by us and our personnel with the FCPA, such policies and procedures may not be effective in all instances to prevent violations. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA, the U.K. anti-bribery laws or other applicable anti-corruption laws could subject us to, among other things, civil and criminal penalties or material fines, profit disgorgement, injunctions on future conduct, securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence, any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects, financial position or the market value of our common stock.\nIn addition, we may also be adversely affected if there is misconduct by personnel of portfolio companies in which our funds invest. For example, financial fraud or other deceptive practices at our funds\u2019 portfolio companies, or failures by personnel at our funds\u2019 portfolio companies to comply with anti-bribery, trade sanctions, anti-harassment, anti-discrimination or other legal and regulatory requirements, could subject us to, among other things, civil and criminal penalties or material fines, profit disgorgement, injunctions on future conduct and securities litigation, and could also cause significant reputational and business harm to us. Such misconduct may undermine our due diligence efforts with respect to such portfolio companies and could negatively affect the valuations of the investments by our funds in such portfolio companies. In addition, we may face an increased risk of such misconduct to the extent our investment in non-U.S.\nmarkets, particularly emerging markets, increases.\nPoor performance of our investment funds would cause a decline in our revenue, income and cash flow, may obligate us to repay Performance Allocations previously paid to us, and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future investment funds.\nIn the event that any of our investment funds were to perform poorly, our revenue, income and cash flow would decline because the value of our assets under management would decrease, which would result in a reduction in management fees, and our investment returns would decrease, resulting in a reduction in the Performance Allocations and Incentive Fees we earn. Moreover, we could experience losses on our investments of\nour own principal as a result of poor investment performance by our investment funds. Furthermore, if, as a result of poor performance of later investments in a carry fund\u2019s life, the fund does not achieve certain investment returns for the fund over its life, we will be obligated to repay the amount by which Performance Allocations that were previously distributed to us exceed the amount to which the relevant general partner is ultimately entitled.\nPoor performance of our investment funds could make it more difficult for us to raise new capital. Investors in funds might decline to invest in future investment funds we raise and investors in hedge funds or other investment funds might withdraw their investments as a result of poor performance of the investment funds in which they are invested. Investors and potential investors in our funds continually assess our investment funds\u2019 performance, and our ability to raise capital for existing and future investment funds and avoid excessive redemption levels will depend on our investment funds\u2019 continued satisfactory performance. Accordingly, poor fund performance may deter future investment in our funds and thereby decrease the capital invested in our funds and ultimately, our management fee revenue. Alternatively, in the face of poor fund performance, investors could demand lower fees or fee concessions for existing or future funds which would likewise decrease our revenue.\nOur asset management business depends in large part on our ability to raise capital from third party investors. A failure to raise capital from third party investors on attractive fee terms or at all, would impact our ability to collect management fees or deploy such capital into investments and potentially collect Performance Allocations, which would materially reduce our revenue and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur ability to raise capital from third party investors depends on a number of factors, including certain factors that are outside our control. Certain factors, such as the performance of the stock market and the asset allocation rules or investment policies to which such third party investors are subject, could inhibit or restrict the ability of third party investors to make investments in our investment funds or the asset classes in which our investment funds invest. For example, state politicians and lawmakers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and North Carolina have taken steps or expressed intent to take steps to reduce or minimize the ability of their state pension funds to invest in alternative asset classes. The Pennsylvania governor, for example, asked the state\u2019s two retirement funds to close out their private equity investments in favor of an all-index\nfund strategy, citing high fees paid to alternative asset managers, and in New Jersey, new commitments by the state pension fund to private equity were frozen in 2018. There is no assurance that other states will not take similar actions, which may impair our access to capital from an investor base that has historically represented a significant portion of our fundraising. In addition, volatility in the valuations of investments, has in the past and may in the future affect our ability to raise capital from third party investors. To the extent periods of volatility are coupled with a lack of realizations from investors\u2019 existing private equity and real estate portfolios, such investors may be left with disproportionately outsized remaining commitments to a number of investment funds, which significantly limits such investors\u2019 ability to make new commitments to third party managed investment funds such as those managed by us.\nOur ability to raise new funds could similarly be hampered if the general appeal of private equity and other alternative investments were to decline. An investment in a limited partner interest in a private equity fund is more illiquid and the returns on such investment may be more volatile than an investment in securities for which there is a more active and transparent market. In periods of positive markets and low volatility, for example, investors may favor passive investment strategies such as index funds over our actively managed investment vehicles. Alternative investments could also fall into disfavor as a result of concerns about liquidity and short-term performance. Such concerns could be exhibited, in particular, by public pension funds, which have historically been among the largest investors in alternative assets. Many public pension funds are significantly underfunded and their funding problems have been, and may in the future be, exacerbated by economic downturn. Concerns with liquidity could cause such public pension funds to reevaluate the appropriateness of alternative investments. Although a number of investors, including certain public pension funds, have increased their allocations to the alternative investments asset class in recent years, there is no assurance that this will continue or that our ability to raise capital from investors will not be hampered. In addition, our ability to raise capital from third parties outside of the U.S. could be limited to the extent other countries, such as China, impose restrictions or limitations on outbound foreign investment.\nMoreover, certain institutional investors are demonstrating a preference to in-source\ntheir own investment professionals and to make direct investments in alternative assets without the assistance of private equity advisers like us. Such institutional investors may become our competitors and could cease to be our clients. As some existing investors cease or significantly curtail making commitments to alternative investment funds, we may need to identify and attract new investors in order to maintain or increase the size of our investment funds. There are no assurances that we can find or secure commitments from those new investors or that the fee terms of the commitments from such new investors will be consistent with the fees historically paid to us by our investors. If economic conditions were to deteriorate or if we are unable to find new investors, we might raise less than our desired amount for a given fund. Further, as we seek to expand into other asset classes, we may be unable to raise a sufficient amount of capital to adequately support such businesses. A failure to successfully raise capital could materially reduce our revenue and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition.\nIn connection with raising new funds or making further investments in existing funds, we negotiate terms for such funds and investments with existing and potential investors. The outcome of such negotiations could result in our agreement to terms that are materially less favorable to us than for prior funds we have managed or funds managed by our competitors, including with respect to management fees, incentive fees and/or carried interest, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues. Such terms could also restrict our ability to raise investment funds with investment objectives or strategies that compete with existing funds, add additional expenses and obligations for us in managing the fund or increase our potential liabilities, all of which could ultimately reduce our revenues. In addition, certain institutional investors, including sovereign wealth funds and public pension funds, have demonstrated an increased preference for alternatives to the traditional investment fund structure, such as managed accounts, smaller funds and co-investment\nvehicles. There can be no assurance that such alternatives will be as profitable for us as the traditional investment fund structure, or as to the impact such a trend could have on the cost of our operations or profitability if we were to implement these alternative investment structures. In addition, certain institutional investors, including public pension funds, have publicly criticized certain fund fee and expense structures, including management fees and transaction and advisory fees. Although we have no obligation to modify any of our fees with respect to our existing funds, we may experience pressure to do so in our funds. For example, we have confronted and expect to continue to confront requests from a variety of investors and groups representing investors to decrease fees, which could result in a reduction in the fees and Performance Allocations and Incentive Fees we earn.\nCertain policies and procedures implemented to mitigate potential conflicts of interest and address certain regulatory requirements may reduce the synergies across our various businesses.\nBecause of our various asset management businesses and our capital markets services business, we will be subject to a number of actual and potential conflicts of interest and subject to greater regulatory oversight and more legal and contractual restrictions than that to which we would otherwise be subject if we had just one line of business. To mitigate these conflicts and address regulatory, legal and contractual requirements across our various businesses, we have implemented certain policies and procedures (for example, information walls) that may reduce the positive synergies that we cultivate across these businesses for purposes of identifying and managing attractive investments. For example, we may come into possession of confidential or material non-public\ninformation with respect to issuers in which we may be considering making an investment or issuers in which our affiliates may hold an interest. As a consequence of such policies and procedures, we may be precluded from providing such information or other ideas to our other businesses that might be of benefit to them.\nOur failure to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest in our investment business could damage our reputation and adversely affect our businesses.\nAs we have expanded and as we continue to expand the number and scope of our businesses, we increasingly confront potential conflicts of interest relating to our funds\u2019 investment activities. Investment manager conflicts of interest continue to be a significant area of focus for regulators and the media. Because of our size and the variety of businesses and investment strategies that we pursue, we may face a higher degree of scrutiny compared with investment managers that are smaller or focus on fewer asset classes. Certain of our funds may have overlapping\ninvestment objectives, including funds that have different fee structures and/or investment strategies that are more narrowly focused. Potential conflicts may arise with respect to allocation of investment opportunities among us, our funds and our affiliates, including to the extent that the fund documents do not mandate a specific investment allocation. For example, we may allocate an investment opportunity that is appropriate for two or more investment funds in a manner that excludes one or more funds or results in a disproportionate allocation based on factors or criteria that we determine, such as sourcing of the transaction, specific nature of the investment or size and type of the investment, among other factors. We may also decide to provide a co-investment\nopportunity to certain investors in lieu of allocating a piece of the investment to our funds. In addition, the challenge of allocating investment opportunities to certain funds may be exacerbated as we expand our business to include more lines of business, including more public vehicles. Allocating investment opportunities appropriately frequently involves significant and subjective judgments. The risk that fund investors or regulators could challenge allocation decisions as inconsistent with our obligations under applicable law, governing fund agreements or our own policies cannot be eliminated. In addition, the perception of non-compliance\nwith such requirements or policies could harm our reputation with fund investors.\nWe may also cause different funds to invest in a single portfolio company, for example where the fund that made an initial investment no longer has capital available to invest. We may also cause different funds that we manage to purchase different classes of securities in the same portfolio company. For example, one of our CLO funds could acquire a debt security issued by the same company in which one of our private equity funds owns common equity securities. A direct conflict of interest could arise between the debt holders and the equity holders if such a company were to develop insolvency concerns, and we would have to carefully manage that conflict. A decision to acquire material non-public\ninformation about a company while pursuing an investment opportunity for a particular fund gives rise to a potential conflict of interest when it results in our having to restrict the ability of other funds to take any action. Our affiliates may be service providers or counterparties to our funds or portfolio companies and receive fees or other compensation for services that are not shared with our fund investors. In such instances, we may be incentivized to cause our funds or portfolio companies to purchase such services from our affiliates rather than an unaffiliated service provider despite the fact that a third party service provider could potentially provide higher quality services or offer them at a lower cost. In addition, conflicts of interest may exist in the valuation of our investments, as well as the personal trading of employees and the allocation of fees and expenses among us, our funds and their portfolio companies, and our affiliates. Lastly, in certain, infrequent instances we may purchase an investment alongside one of our investment funds or sell an investment to one of our investment funds and conflicts may arise in respect of the allocation, pricing and timing of such investments and the ultimate disposition of such investments. A failure to appropriately deal with these, among other, conflicts, could negatively impact our reputation and ability to raise additional funds or result in potential litigation or regulatory action against us.\nConflicts of interest may arise in our allocation of co-investment\nopportunities.\nPotential conflicts will arise with respect to our decisions regarding how to allocate co-investment\nopportunities among investors and the terms of any such co-investments.\nAs a general matter, our allocation of co-investment\nopportunities is within our discretion and there can be no assurance that co-investment\nopportunities of any particular type or amount will become available to any of our investors. We may take into account a variety of factors and considerations we deem relevant in allocating co-investment\nopportunities, including, without limitation, whether a potential co-investor\nhas expressed an interest in evaluating co-investment\nopportunities, our assessment of a potential co-investor\u2019s\nability to invest an amount of capital that fits the needs of the investment and our assessment of a potential co-investor\u2019s\nability to commit to a co-investment\nopportunity within the required timeframe of the particular transaction.\nOur fund documents typically do not mandate specific allocations with respect to co-investments.\nThe investment advisers of our funds may have an incentive to provide potential co-investment\nopportunities to certain investors in lieu of others and/or in lieu of an allocation to our funds (including, for example, as part of an investor\u2019s overall strategic relationship with us) if such allocations are expected to generate relatively greater fees or Performance Allocations to us than would arise if such co-investment\nopportunities were allocated otherwise.\nCo-investment\narrangements may be structured through one or more of our investment vehicles, and in such circumstances co-investors\nwill generally bear the costs and expenses thereof (which may lead to conflicts of interest regarding the allocation of costs and expenses between such co-investors\nand investors in our funds). The terms of any such existing and future co-investment\nvehicles may differ materially, and in some instances may be more favorable to us, than the terms of certain of our funds or prior co-investment\nvehicles, and such different terms may create an incentive for us to allocate a greater or lesser percentage of an investment opportunity to such co-investment\nvehicles. There can be no assurance that any conflicts of interest will be resolved in favor of any particular investment funds or investors (including any applicable co-investors).\nWe have increasingly undertaken business initiatives to increase the number and type of investment products we offer to retail investors, which could expose us to new and greater levels of risk.\nAlthough retail investors have been part of our historic distribution efforts, we have increasingly undertaken business initiatives to increase the number and type of investment products we offer to high net worth individuals, family offices and mass affluent investors. In some cases we seek to distribute our unregistered funds to such retail investors indirectly through feeder funds sponsored by brokerage firms, private banks or third party feeder providers, and in other cases directly to the qualified clients of private banks, independent investment advisors and brokers. In other cases we create investment products regulated by the SEC specifically designed for direct investment by retail investors, some of whom are not accredited investors. In June 2020, the DOL, which has jurisdiction over the regulation of U.S. defined benefit and contribution plans, issued guidance clarifying that fiduciaries of individual account plans (such as 401(k) plans) could include a managed asset allocation fund (such as a target date fund, target risk fund or balanced fund) that invests a portion of its assets in private investment funds as an investment option. The DOL guidance could augur greater access by 401(k) plan participants to investments that include a private equity component, which may present significant fundraising opportunities for our investment funds. However, under the new administration, the SEC and other regulatory agencies may be less supportive of efforts to expand retail directed products or may impose conditions that would increase the regulatory burdens and costs of offering such products. New or different policy initiatives within the SEC and other regulatory agencies may prevent or limit our ability to offer investment products to retail investors directly or through retirement plans, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our initiatives to access retail investors entail the investment of resources and our objectives may not be fully realized.\nMoreover, accessing retail investors and selling retail directed products exposes us to new and greater levels of risk, including heightened litigation and regulatory enforcement risks. To the extent we distribute retail products through new channels, including through unaffiliated firms, we may not be able to effectively monitor or control the manner of their distribution, which could result in litigation against us, including with respect to, among other things, claims that products distributed through such channels are distributed to customers for whom they are unsuitable or distributed in any other inappropriate manner. Although we seek to ensure through due diligence and onboarding procedures that the channels through which retail investors access our investment products conduct themselves responsibly, to the extent that our investment products are being distributed through third parties, we are exposed to reputational damage and possible legal liability to the extent such third parties improperly sell our products to investors. Similarly, the hiring of employees to oversee independent advisors and brokerage firms presents risks if they fail to follow training and supervisory procedures. In addition, the distribution of retail products, including through new channels whether directly or through market intermediaries, could expose us to additional regulatory risk in the form of allegations of improper conduct and/or actions by state and federal regulators against us with respect to, among other things, product suitability, conflicts of interest and the adequacy of disclosure to customers to whom our products are distributed through those channels.\nValuation methodologies for certain assets in our funds can be subject to significant subjectivity and the fair value of assets established pursuant to such methodologies may never be realized, which could result in significant losses for our funds and the reduction of Performance Revenues.\nOur investment funds make investments in illiquid investments or financial instruments for which there is little, if any, market activity. We determine the value of such investments and financial instruments on at least a quarterly basis based on the fair value of such investments. The fair value of such investments and financial instruments is generally determined using a primary methodology and corroborated by a secondary methodology. Methodologies are used on a consistent basis and described in the investment funds\u2019 valuation policies.\nThe determination of fair value using these methodologies takes into consideration a range of factors including, but not limited to, the price at which the investment was acquired, the nature of the investment, local market conditions, trading values on public exchanges for comparable securities, current and projected operating performance and financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment. These valuation methodologies involve a significant degree of management judgment. For example, as to investments that we share with another sponsor, we may apply a different valuation methodology than the other sponsor does or derive a different value than the other sponsor has derived on the same investment. These differences might cause some investors to question our valuations. See \u201cPart II. Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Critical Accounting Policies\u201d for an overview of our fair value policy and the significant judgment required in the application thereof in the use of different underlying assumptions, estimates, methodologies and/or judgments in the determination of the value of certain investments and financial instruments could potentially produce materially different results.\nBecause there is significant uncertainty in the valuation of, or in the stability of the value of illiquid investments, the fair values of such investments as reflected in an investment fund\u2019s net asset value do not necessarily reflect the prices that would actually be obtained by us on behalf of the investment fund when such investments are realized. Realizations at values significantly lower than the values at which investments have been reflected in prior fund net asset values would result in reduced gains or losses for the applicable fund, a decline in certain asset management fees and the reduction in potential Performance Allocations and Incentive Fees. Changes in values of investments from quarter to quarter may result in volatility in our investment funds\u2019 net asset value, our investment in, or fees from, those funds and the results of operations and cash flow that we report from period to period. Further, a situation where asset values turn out to be materially different than values reflected in prior fund net asset values could cause investors to lose confidence in us, which would in turn result in difficulty in raising additional funds or redemptions from our hedge funds.\nOur use of borrowings to finance our business exposes us to risks.\nWe use borrowings to finance our business operations as a public company. We have numerous outstanding notes with various maturity dates as well as a revolving credit facility that matures on November 24, 2025. See \u201cPart II. Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Sources and Uses of Liquidity\u201d for further information regarding our outstanding borrowings. As borrowings under the credit facility and our outstanding notes mature, we will be required to refinance or repay such borrowings. In order to do so, we may enter into a new facility or issue new notes, each of which could result in higher borrowing costs. We may also issue equity, which would dilute existing stockholders. Further, we may choose to repay such borrowings using cash on hand, cash provided by our continuing operations or cash from the sale of our assets, each of which could reduce the amount of cash available to facilitate the growth and expansion of our businesses and pay dividends to our stockholders and operating expenses and other obligations as they arise. In order to obtain new borrowings, or to extend or refinance existing borrowings, we are dependent on the willingness and ability of financial institutions such as global banks to extend credit to us on favorable terms, and on our ability to access the debt and equity capital markets, which can be volatile. There is no guarantee that such financial institutions will continue to extend credit to us or that we will be able to access the capital markets to obtain new borrowings or refinance existing borrowings when they mature. In addition, the use of leverage to finance our business exposes us to the types of risk described in \u201c- Dependence on significant leverage in investments by our funds could adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments.\u201d\nInterest rates on our and our portfolio companies\u2019 outstanding financial instruments might be subject to change based on regulatory developments, which could adversely affect our revenue, expenses and the value of those financial instruments.\nLIBOR and certain other floating rate benchmark indices, including, without limitation, the Euro Interbank Offered Rate, Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate, Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate and Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (collectively, \u201cIBORs\u201d) are the subject of recent national, international and regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. On November 30, 2020, the FCA, which regulates LIBOR, announced that subject to confirmation following its consultation with the administrator of LIBOR, it would cease publication of the one-week\nand two-month\nU.S. dollar LIBOR immediately after December 31, 2021 and cease publication of the remaining tenors immediately after June 30, 2023. Additionally, the Federal Reserve Board has advised banks to stop entering into new U.S. dollar LIBOR based contracts. Other jurisdictions have also indicated they will implement reforms or phase-outs, which are currently scheduled to take effect at the end of calendar year 2021. A transition away from the widespread use of the various IBORs to alternative rates is expected to occur over the course of the next several years. However, there is a lack of clarity as to what methods of calculating a replacement benchmark will be established or adopted generally, or whether different industry bodies, such as the loan market and the derivatives market, will adopt the same methodologies. In addition, as part of the transition to a replacement benchmark, parties may seek to adjust the spreads relative to such benchmarks in underlying contractual arrangements. As a result, interest rates on our CLOs and other financial instruments tied to IBOR rates, including those where Blackstone or its funds are exposed as lender or borrower, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those financial instruments, may be adversely affected. For example, if lenders demand increases to credit spreads in order to migrate to alternative rates due to structural differences in the reference rates, this could increase our, our portfolio companies\u2019 and/or our funds\u2019 interest expense and cost of capital.\nFurther, any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of any IBOR as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the value of our and our portfolio companies\u2019 financial instruments tied to such rates. There is no guarantee that a transition from any IBOR to an alternative will not result in financial market disruptions or a significant increase in volatility in risk free benchmark rates or borrowing costs to borrowers. Although we have been proactively negotiating provisions in our portfolio companies\u2019 and lending businesses\u2019 recent debt agreements to provide additional flexibility to address the transition away from IBOR, there is no assurance that we will be able to adequately minimize the risk of disruption from the discontinuation of IBOR or other changes to benchmark indices.\nIn addition, meaningful time and effort is required to transition to the use of new benchmark rates, including with respect to the negotiation and implementation of any necessary changes to existing contractual arrangements and the implementation of changes to our systems and processes. Negotiating and implementing necessary amendments to our existing contractual arrangements may be particularly costly and time consuming. We are actively evaluating the operational and other impacts of such changes and managing transition efforts accordingly.\nThe historical returns attributable to our funds should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds or of our future results or of any returns expected on an investment in common stock.\nThe historical and potential future returns of the investment funds that we manage are not directly linked to returns on our common stock. Therefore, any continued positive performance of the investment funds that we manage will not necessarily result in positive returns on an investment in our common stock. However, poor performance of the investment funds that we manage would cause a decline in our revenue from such investment funds, and would therefore have a negative effect on our performance and in all likelihood the returns on an investment in our common stock.\nMoreover, with respect to the historical returns of our investment funds:\n\u2022\nwe may create new funds in the future that reflect a different asset mix and different investment strategies (including funds whose management fees represent a more significant proportion of the fees than has historically been the case), as well as a varied geographic and industry exposure as compared to our present funds, and any such new funds could have different returns from our existing or previous funds,\n\u2022\ndespite periods of volatility, market conditions have been largely favorable in recent years, which has helped to generate positive performance, particularly in our private equity and real estate businesses, but there can be no assurance that such conditions will repeat or that our current or future investment funds will avail themselves of comparable market conditions,\n\u2022\nthe rates of returns of our carry funds reflect unrealized gains as of the applicable measurement date that may never be realized, which may adversely affect the ultimate value realized from those funds\u2019 investments,\n\u2022\ncompetition for investment opportunities resulting from, among other things, the increased amount of capital invested in alternative investment funds continues to increase,\n\u2022\nour investment funds\u2019 returns in some years benefited from investment opportunities and general market conditions that may not repeat themselves, our current or future investment funds might not be able to avail themselves of comparable investment opportunities or market conditions, and the circumstances under which our current or future funds may make future investments may differ significantly from those conditions prevailing in the past,\n\u2022\nnewly established funds may generate lower returns during the period in which they initially deploy their capital, and\n\u2022\nthe rates of return reflect our historical cost structure, which may vary in the future due to various factors enumerated elsewhere in this report and other factors beyond our control, including changes in laws.\nThe future internal rate of return for any current or future fund may vary considerably from the historical internal rate of return generated by any particular fund, or for our funds as a whole. In addition, future returns will be affected by the applicable risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nincluding risks of the industries and businesses in which a particular fund invests.\nDependence on significant leverage in investments by our funds could adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments.\nMany of our funds\u2019 investments rely heavily on the use of leverage, and our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on investments will depend on our ability to access sufficient sources of indebtedness at attractive rates. For example, in many private equity and real estate investments, indebtedness may constitute as much as 70% or more of a portfolio company\u2019s or real estate asset\u2019s total debt and equity capitalization, including debt that may be incurred in connection with the investment. The absence of available sources of sufficient senior debt financing for extended periods of time could therefore materially and adversely affect our private equity and real estate businesses. In addition, in March 2013, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. federal banking agencies issued updated leveraged lending guidance covering transactions characterized by a degree of financial leverage. Such guidance may limit the amount or cost of financing we are able to obtain for our transactions, and as a result, the returns on our investments may suffer. However, the status of the 2013 leveraged lending guidance remains uncertain following a determination by the Government Accountability Office in October 2017 that resulted in such guidance being required to be submitted to U.S. Congress for review. The possibility exists that, under the new administration, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies could apply the leveraged lending guidance in its current form, or implement a revised or new rule that limits leveraged lending. Such regulatory action could limit the amount of funding and increase the cost of financing available for leveraged loan borrowers such as Blackstone Tactical Opportunities and our corporate private equity business overall. Furthermore, limits on the deductibility of corporate interest expense could make it more costly to use debt financing for our acquisitions or otherwise have an adverse impact on the cost structure of our transactions, and could therefore adversely affect the returns on our funds\u2019 investments. See \u201c- Proposed changes in U.S. and foreign taxation of businesses could adversely affect us.\u201d\nIn addition, an increase in either the general levels of interest rates or in the risk spread demanded by sources of indebtedness would make it more expensive to finance those businesses\u2019 investments. See \u201c- An increase in interest rates and other changes in the debt financing markets could negatively impact the ability of our funds and their portfolio companies to obtain attractive financing or refinancing and could increase the cost of such financing if it is obtained, which could lead to lower-yielding investments and potentially decrease our net income.\u201d\nInvestments in highly leveraged entities are inherently more sensitive to declines in revenues, increases in expenses and interest rates and adverse economic, market and industry developments. The incurrence of a significant amount of indebtedness by an entity could, among other things:\n\u2022\ngive rise to an obligation to make mandatory pre-payments\nof debt using excess cash flow, which might limit the entity\u2019s ability to respond to changing industry conditions to the extent additional cash is needed for the response, to make unplanned but necessary capital expenditures or to take advantage of growth opportunities,\n\u2022\nlimit the entity\u2019s ability to adjust to changing market conditions, thereby placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors who have relatively less debt,\n\u2022\nallow even moderate reductions in operating cash flow to render it unable to service its indebtedness, leading to a bankruptcy or other reorganization of the entity and a loss of part or all of the equity investment in it,\n\u2022\nlimit the entity\u2019s ability to engage in strategic acquisitions that might be necessary to generate attractive returns or further growth, and\n\u2022\nlimit the entity\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing or increase the cost of obtaining such financing, including for capital expenditures, working capital or general corporate purposes.\nAs a result, the risk of loss associated with a leveraged entity is generally greater than for companies with comparatively less debt. For example, many investments consummated by private equity sponsors during 2005, 2006 and 2007 that utilized significant amounts of leverage subsequently experienced severe economic stress and, in certain cases, defaulted on their debt obligations due to a decrease in revenues and cash flow precipitated by the subsequent economic downturn during 2008 and 2009.\nWhen our funds\u2019 existing portfolio investments reach the point when debt incurred to finance those investments matures in significant amounts and must be either repaid or refinanced, those investments may materially suffer if they have generated insufficient cash flow to repay maturing debt and there is insufficient capacity and availability in the financing markets to permit them to refinance maturing debt on satisfactory terms, or at all. If a limited availability of financing for such purposes were to persist for an extended period of time, when significant amounts of the debt incurred to finance our private equity and real estate funds\u2019 existing portfolio investments came due, these funds could be materially and adversely affected.\nMany of the hedge funds in which our funds of hedge funds invest and our credit-focused funds, or CLOs, may choose to use leverage as part of their respective investment programs and regularly borrow a substantial amount of their capital. The use of leverage poses a significant degree of risk and enhances the possibility of a significant loss in the value of the investment portfolio. A fund may borrow money from time to time to purchase or carry securities or may enter into derivative transactions (such as total return swaps) with counterparties that have embedded leverage. The interest expense and other costs incurred in connection with such borrowing may not be recovered by appreciation in the securities purchased or carried and will be lost - and the timing and magnitude of such losses may be accelerated or exacerbated - in the event of a decline in the market value of such securities. Gains realized with borrowed funds may cause the fund\u2019s net asset value to increase at a faster rate than would be the case without borrowings. However, if investment results fail to cover the cost of borrowings, the fund\u2019s net asset value could also decrease faster than if there had been no borrowings.\nAny of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe due diligence process that we undertake in connection with investments by our investment funds may not reveal all facts and issues that may be relevant in connection with an investment.\nWhen evaluating a potential business or asset for investment, we conduct due diligence that we deem reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to such investment. When conducting due diligence, we may be required to evaluate important and complex issues, including but not limited to those related to business, financial, credit risk, tax, accounting, ESG, legal and regulatory and macroeconomic trends. With respect to ESG, the nature and scope of our diligence will vary based on the investment, but may include a review of, among other things: air and water pollution, land contamination, diversity, employee health and safety, accounting standards and bribery and corruption. Outside consultants, legal advisers, accountants and investment banks may be involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment. The due diligence investigation that we will carry out with respect to any investment opportunity may not reveal or highlight all relevant facts (including fraud) or risks that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such investment opportunity and we may not identify or foresee future developments that could have a material adverse effect on an investment, including, for example, potential factors, such as technological disruption of a specific company or asset, or an entire industry. Further, some matters covered by our diligence, such as ESG, are continuously evolving and we may not accurately or fully anticipate such evolution. In addition, when conducting due diligence on investments, including with respect to investments made by our funds of hedge funds in third party hedge funds, we rely on the resources available to us and information supplied by third parties, including information provided by the target of the investment (or, in the case of investments in a third party hedge fund, information provided by such hedge fund or its service providers). The information we receive from third parties may not be accurate or complete and therefore we may not have all the relevant facts and information necessary to properly assess and monitor our funds\u2019 investment.\nOur asset management activities involve investments in relatively high-risk, illiquid assets, and we may fail to realize any profits from these activities for a considerable period of time or lose some or all of our principal investments.\nMany of our investment funds invest in securities that are not publicly traded. In many cases, our investment funds may be prohibited by contract or by applicable securities laws from selling such securities for a period of time. Our investment funds will generally not be able to sell these securities publicly unless their sale is registered under applicable securities laws, or unless an exemption from such registration is available. The ability of many of our investment funds, particularly our private equity funds, to dispose of investments is heavily dependent on the public equity markets. For example, the ability to realize any value from an investment may depend upon the ability to complete an initial public offering of the portfolio company in which such investment is held. Even if the securities are publicly traded, large holdings of securities can often be disposed of only over a substantial length of time, exposing the investment returns to risks of downward movement in market prices during the intended disposition period. Moreover, because the investment strategy of many of our funds, particularly our private equity and real estate funds, often entails our having representation on our funds\u2019 public portfolio company boards, our funds may be restricted in their ability to effect such sales during certain time periods. Accordingly, under certain conditions, our investment funds may be forced to either sell securities at lower prices than they had expected to realize or defer - potentially for a considerable period of time - sales that they had planned to make. We have made and expect to continue to make significant principal investments in our current and future investment funds. Contributing capital to these investment funds is risky, and we may lose some or the entire principal amount of our investments.\nWe pursue large or otherwise complex investments, which involve enhanced business, regulatory, legal and other risks.\nA number of our funds, including our real estate and private equity funds, have invested and intend to continue to invest in large transactions or transactions that otherwise have substantial business, regulatory or legal complexity. In addition, as we raise new funds, such funds\u2019 mandates may include investing in such transactions. Such investments involve enhanced risks. For example, larger or otherwise complex transactions may be more difficult, expensive and time-consuming to finance and execute. In addition, managing or realizing value from such investments may be more difficult as a result of, among other things, a limited universe of potential acquirers. In addition, larger or otherwise complex transactions may entail a higher level of scrutiny by regulators, labor unions and other third parties, as well as a greater risk of unknown and/or contingent liabilities. Any of these factors could increase the risk that our larger or more complex investments could be less successful and in turn harm the performance of our funds.\nLarger transactions may be structured as \u201cconsortium transactions\u201d due to the size of the investment and the amount of capital required to be invested. A consortium transaction involves an equity investment in which two or more investors serve together or collectively as equity sponsors. We have historically participated in a significant number of consortium transactions due to the increased size of many of the transactions in which we have been involved. Consortium transactions generally entail a reduced level of control by Blackstone over the investment because governance rights must be shared with the other investors. Accordingly, we may not be able to control decisions relating to the investment, including decisions relating to the management and operation of the company and the timing and nature of any exit, which could result in the risks described in \u201c- Our investment funds make investments in companies that we do not control.\u201d In addition, the consequences to our investment funds of an unsuccessful larger investment could be more severe given the size of the investment.\nOur investment funds make investments in companies that we do not control.\nInvestments by most of our investment funds will include debt instruments and equity securities of companies that we do not control. Such investments will be subject to the risk that the company in which the investment is made may make business, financial or management decisions with which we do not agree or that the majority stakeholders or the management of the company may take risks or otherwise act in a manner that does not serve our interests. In addition, to the extent we hold only a minority equity interest in a company, we may lack affirmative control rights, which may diminish our ability to influence the company\u2019s affairs in a manner intended to enhance the value of our investment in the company, including with respect to the form and timing of an exit. If any of the foregoing were to occur, the values of investments by our investment funds could decrease and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could suffer as a result.\nWe expect to make investments in companies that are based outside of the United States, which may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in companies that are based in the United States.\nMany of our investment funds generally invest a significant portion of their assets in the equity, debt, loans or other securities of issuers located outside the United States. International investments have increased and we expect will continue to increase as a proportion of certain of our funds\u2019 portfolios in the future. Investments in non-U.S.\nsecurities involve certain factors not typically associated with investing in U.S. securities, including risks relating to:\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange matters, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates and costs associated with conversion of investment principal and income from one currency into another,\n\u2022\nless developed or efficient financial markets than in the United States, which may lead to potential price volatility and relative illiquidity,\n\u2022\nthe absence of uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards, practices and disclosure requirements and less government supervision and regulation,\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or clarifications to existing laws that could impact our tax treaty positions, which could adversely impact the returns on our investments,\n\u2022\na less developed legal or regulatory environment, differences in the legal and regulatory environment or enhanced legal and regulatory compliance,\n\u2022\nheightened exposure to corruption risk in non-U.S.\nmarkets,\n\u2022\npolitical hostility to investments by foreign or private equity investors,\n\u2022\nreliance on a more limited number of commodity inputs, service providers and/or distribution mechanisms,\n\u2022\nhigher rates of inflation,\n\u2022\nhigher transaction costs,\n\u2022\ndifficulty in enforcing contractual obligations,\n\u2022\nfewer investor protections and less publicly available information in respect of companies in non-U.S.\nmarkets,\n\u2022\ncertain economic and political risks, including potential exchange control regulations and restrictions on our non-U.S.\ninvestments and repatriation of profits on investments or of capital invested, the risks of political, economic or social instability, the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation and adverse economic and political developments, and\n\u2022\nthe possible imposition of non-U.S.\ntaxes or withholding on income and gains recognized with respect to such securities.\nIn addition, investments in companies that are based outside of the United States may be negatively impacted by restrictions on international trade or the recent or potential further imposition of tariffs. See \u201c- Ongoing trade negotiations and related government actions and potential for further regulatory reform may create regulatory uncertainty for our portfolio companies and our investment strategies and adversely affect the profitability of our portfolio companies.\u201d\nThere can be no assurance that adverse developments with respect to such risks will not adversely affect our assets that are held in certain countries or the returns from these assets.\nWe may not have sufficient cash to pay back \u201cclawback\u201d obligations if and when they are triggered under the governing agreements with our investors.\nIn certain circumstances, at the end of the life of a carry fund (or earlier with respect to certain of our real estate funds, real estate debt funds and certain multi-asset class and/or opportunistic investment funds), as a result of diminished performance of later investments in any carry fund\u2019s life, we may be obligated to repay the amount by which Performance Allocations that were previously distributed to us exceed the amounts to which the relevant general partner is ultimately entitled on an after-tax\nbasis. This includes situations in which the general partner receives in excess of the relevant Performance Allocations applicable to the fund as applied to the fund\u2019s cumulative net profits over the life of the fund or, in some cases, the fund has not achieved investment returns that exceed the preferred return threshold. This obligation is known as a \u201cclawback\u201d obligation and is an obligation of any person who received such Performance Allocations, including us and other participants in our Performance Allocations plans. Although a portion of any dividends by us to our stockholders may include any Performance Allocations received by us, we do not intend to seek fulfillment of any clawback obligation by seeking to have our stockholders return any portion of such dividends attributable to Performance Allocations associated with any clawback obligation. To the extent we are required to fulfill a clawback obligation, however, our board of directors may determine to decrease the amount of our dividends to our stockholders. The clawback obligation operates with respect to a given carry fund\u2019s own net investment performance only and performance of other funds are not netted for determining this contingent obligation.\nAdverse economic conditions may increase the likelihood that one or more of our carry funds may be subject to clawback obligations upon the end of their respective lives (or earlier with respect to certain of our real estate funds, real estate debt funds and certain multi-asset class and/or opportunistic investment funds). To the extent one or more clawback obligations were to occur for any one or more carry funds, we might not have available cash at the time such clawback obligation is triggered to repay the Performance Allocations and satisfy such obligation. If we were unable to repay such Performance Allocations, we would be in breach of the governing agreements with our investors and could be subject to liability. Moreover, although a clawback obligation is several, the governing agreements of most of our funds provide that to the extent another recipient of Performance Allocations (such as a current or former employee) does not fund his or her respective share, then we and our employees who participate in such Performance Allocations plans may have to fund additional amounts (generally an additional 50-70%\nbeyond our pro-rata\nshare of such obligations) beyond what we actually received in Performance Allocations, although we retain the right to pursue any remedies that we have under such governing agreements against those Performance Allocations recipients who fail to fund their obligations.\nInvestments by our investment funds will in many cases rank junior to investments made by others.\nIn most cases, the companies in which our investment funds invest will have indebtedness or equity securities, or may be permitted to incur indebtedness or to issue equity securities, that rank senior to our investment. By their terms, such instruments may provide that their holders are entitled to receive payments of dividends, interest or principal on or before the dates on which payments are to be made in respect of our investment. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a company in which an investment is made, holders of securities ranking senior to our investment would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before distributions could be made in respect of our investment. After repaying senior security holders, the company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying amounts owed in respect of our investment. To the extent that any assets remain, holders of claims that rank equally with our investment would be entitled to share on an equal and ratable basis in distributions that are made out of those assets. Also, during periods of financial distress or following an insolvency, the ability of our investment funds to influence a company\u2019s affairs and to take actions to protect their investments may be substantially less than that of the senior creditors.\nInvestors in our hedge funds or open-ended funds may redeem their investments in these funds. In addition, the investment management agreements related to our separately managed accounts may permit the investor to terminate our management of such account on short notice. Lastly, investors in our other investment funds have the right to cause these investment funds to be dissolved. Any of these events would lead to a decrease in our revenues, which could be substantial.\nInvestors in our hedge funds may generally redeem their investments on an annual, semi-annual or quarterly basis following the expiration of a specified period of time when capital may not be withdrawn, subject to the applicable fund\u2019s specific redemption provisions. In addition, we have certain other open-ended funds, including core+ real estate and certain real estate debt funds, which contain similar redemption provisions in their governing documents. In a declining market, many hedge funds and other open-ended funds, including some of our funds, may experience declines in value, and the pace of redemptions and consequent reduction in our assets under management could accelerate. Such declines in value may be both provoked and exacerbated by margin calls and forced selling of assets. To the extent appropriate and permissible under a fund\u2019s constituent documents, we may limit or suspend redemptions during a redemption period, which may have a reputational impact on us. See \u201c- Hedge fund investments are subject to numerous additional risks.\u201d The decrease in revenues that would result from significant redemptions in our hedge funds and other open-ended funds could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, net income and cash flows.\nWe currently manage a significant portion of investor assets through separately managed accounts whereby we earn management and/or incentive fees, and we intend to continue to seek additional separately managed account mandates. The investment management agreements we enter into in connection with managing separately managed accounts on behalf of certain clients may be terminated by such clients on as little as 30 days\u2019\nprior written notice. In addition, the boards of directors of the investment management companies we manage could terminate our advisory engagement of those companies, on as little as 30 days\u2019 prior written notice. In the case of any such terminations, the management and incentive fees we earn in connection with managing such account or company would immediately cease, which could result in a significant adverse impact on our revenues.\nThe governing agreements of most of our investment funds (with the exception of certain of our funds of hedge funds, hedge funds, certain credit-focused and real estate debt funds, and other funds or separately managed accounts for the benefit of one or more specified investors) provide that, subject to certain conditions, third party investors in those funds have the right to remove the general partner of the fund or to accelerate the termination date of the investment fund without cause by a simple majority vote, resulting in a reduction in management fees we would earn from such investment funds and a significant reduction in the amounts of Performance Allocations and Incentive Fees from those funds. Performance Allocations and Incentive Fees could be significantly reduced as a result of our inability to maximize the value of investments by an investment fund during the liquidation process or in the event of the triggering of a \u201cclawback\u201d obligation. In addition, the governing agreements of our investment funds provide that in the event certain \u201ckey persons\u201d in our investment funds do not meet specified time commitments with regard to managing the fund, then investors in certain funds have the right to vote to terminate the investment period by a specified percentage (including, in certain cases, a simple majority) vote in accordance with specified procedures, accelerate the withdrawal of their capital on an investor-by-investor\nbasis, or the fund\u2019s investment period will automatically terminate and a specified percentage (including, in certain cases, a simple majority) vote of investors is required to restart it. In addition, the governing agreements of some of our investment funds provide that investors have the right to terminate, for any reason, the investment period by a vote of 75% of the investors in such fund. In addition to having a significant negative impact on our revenue, net income and cash flow, the occurrence of such an event with respect to any of our investment funds would likely result in significant reputational damage to us.\nIn addition, because all of our investment funds have advisers that are registered under the Advisers Act, an \u201cassignment\u201d of the management agreements of all of our investment funds (which may be deemed to occur in the event these advisers were to experience a change of control) would generally be prohibited without investor consent. We cannot be certain that consents required for assignments of our investment management agreements will be obtained if a change of control occurs, which could result in the termination of such agreements. In addition, with respect to our 1940 Act registered funds, each investment fund\u2019s investment management agreement must be approved annually by the independent members of such investment fund\u2019s board of directors and, in certain cases, by its stockholders, as required by law. Termination of these agreements would cause us to lose the fees we earn from such investment funds.\nThird party investors in our investment funds with commitment-based structures may not satisfy their contractual obligation to fund capital calls when requested by us, which could adversely affect a fund\u2019s operations and performance.\nInvestors in all of our carry funds (and certain of our hedge funds) make capital commitments to those funds that we are entitled to call from those investors at any time during prescribed periods. We depend on investors fulfilling their commitments when we call capital from them in order for those funds to consummate investments and otherwise pay their obligations (for example, management fees) when due. A default by an investor may also limit a fund\u2019s availability to incur borrowings and avail itself of what would otherwise have been available credit. We have not had investors fail to honor capital calls to any meaningful extent. Any investor that did not fund a capital call would generally be subject to several possible penalties, including having a significant amount of its existing investment forfeited in that fund. However, the impact of the forfeiture penalty is directly correlated to the amount of capital previously invested by the investor in the fund and if an investor has invested little or no capital, for instance early in the life of the fund, then the forfeiture penalty may not be as meaningful. Third party investors in private equity, real estate and venture capital funds typically use distributions from prior investments to meet future capital calls. In cases where valuations of investors\u2019 existing investments fall and the pace of distributions slows, investors may be unable to make new commitments to third party managed investment funds such as those advised by us. If investors were to fail to satisfy a significant amount of capital calls for any particular fund or funds, the operation and performance of those funds could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisk management activities may adversely affect the return on our funds\u2019 investments.\nWhen managing our exposure to market risks, we may (on our own behalf or on behalf of our funds) from time to time use forward contracts, options, swaps, caps, collars and floors or pursue other strategies or use other forms of derivative instruments to limit our exposure to changes in the relative values of investments that may result from market developments, including changes in prevailing interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The success of any hedging or other derivatives transactions generally will depend on our ability to correctly predict market changes, the degree of correlation between price movements of a derivative instrument, the position being hedged, the creditworthiness of the counterparty and other factors. As a result, while we may enter into a transaction in order to reduce our exposure to market risks, the transaction may result in poorer overall investment performance than if it had not been executed. Such transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the value of a hedged position increases.\nWhile such hedging arrangements may reduce certain risks, such arrangements themselves may entail certain other risks. These arrangements may require the posting of cash collateral at a time when a fund has insufficient cash or illiquid assets such that the posting of the cash is either impossible or requires the sale of assets at prices that do not reflect their underlying value. Moreover, these hedging arrangements may generate significant transaction costs, including potential tax costs, that reduce the returns generated by a fund. Finally, the CFTC may in the future require certain foreign exchange products to be subject to mandatory clearing, which could increase the cost of entering into currency hedges.\nOur real estate funds are subject to the risks inherent in the ownership and operation of real estate and the construction and development of real estate.\nInvestments in our real estate funds will be subject to the risks inherent in the ownership and operation of real estate and real estate-related businesses and assets, including the deterioration of real estate fundamentals. These risks include, but are not limited to, those associated with the burdens of ownership of real property, general and local economic conditions, changes in supply of and demand for competing properties in an area (as a result, for instance, of overbuilding), fluctuations in the average occupancy and room rates for hotel properties, operating income, the financial resources of tenants, changes in building, environmental, zoning and other laws, casualty or condemnation losses, energy and supply shortages, various uninsured or uninsurable risks, natural disasters, climate change related risks (including climate-related transition risks and acute and chronic physical risks), changes in government regulations (such as rent control), changes in real property tax rates, changes in income tax rates, changes in interest rates, the reduced availability of mortgage funds which may render the sale or refinancing of properties difficult or impracticable, increased mortgage defaults, increases in borrowing rates, changes to the taxation of business entities and the deductibility of corporate interest expense, negative developments in the economy that depress travel activity, environmental liabilities, contingent liabilities on disposition of assets, acts of god, terrorist attacks, war and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, if our real estate funds acquire direct or indirect interests in undeveloped land or underdeveloped real property, which may often be non-income\nproducing, they will be subject to the risks normally associated with such assets and development activities, including risks relating to the availability and timely receipt of zoning and other regulatory or environmental approvals, the cost and timely completion of construction (including risks beyond the control of our fund, such as weather or labor conditions or material shortages) and the availability of both construction and permanent financing on favorable terms. In addition, our real estate funds may also make investments in residential real estate projects and/or otherwise participate in financing opportunities relating to residential real estate assets or portfolios thereof from time to time, which may be more highly susceptible to adverse changes in prevailing economic and/or market conditions and present additional risks relative to the ownership and operation of commercial real estate assets.\nCertain of our investment funds may invest in securities of companies that are experiencing significant financial or business difficulties, including companies involved in bankruptcy or other reorganization and liquidation proceedings. Such investments are subject to a greater risk of poor performance or loss.\nCertain of our investment funds, especially our credit-focused funds, may invest in business enterprises involved in work-outs, liquidations, spin-offs, reorganizations, bankruptcies and similar transactions and may purchase high-risk receivables. An investment in such business enterprises entails the risk that the transaction in which such business enterprise is involved either will be unsuccessful, will take considerable time or will result in a distribution of cash or a new security the value of which will be less than the purchase price to the fund of the security or other financial instrument in respect of which such distribution is received. In addition, if an anticipated transaction does not in fact occur, the fund may be required to sell its investment at a loss. Investments in troubled companies may also be adversely affected by U.S. federal and state laws relating to, among other things, fraudulent conveyances, voidable preferences, lender liability and a bankruptcy court\u2019s discretionary power to disallow, subordinate or disenfranchise particular claims. Investments in securities and private claims of troubled companies made in connection with an attempt to influence a restructuring proposal or plan of reorganization in a bankruptcy case may also involve substantial litigation. Because there is substantial uncertainty concerning the outcome of transactions involving financially troubled companies, there is a potential risk of loss by a fund of its entire investment in such company. Moreover, a major economic recession could have a materially adverse impact on the value of such securities. Adverse publicity and investor perceptions, whether or not based on fundamental analysis, may also decrease the value and liquidity of securities rated below investment grade or otherwise adversely affect our reputation.\nIn addition, at least one federal Circuit Court has determined that an investment fund could be liable for ERISA Title IV pension obligations (including withdrawal liability incurred with respect to union multiemployer plans) of its portfolio companies, if such fund is a \u201ctrade or business\u201d and the fund\u2019s ownership interest in the portfolio company is significant enough to bring the investment fund within the portfolio company\u2019s \u201ccontrolled group.\u201d While a number of cases have held that managing investments is not a \u201ctrade or business\u201d for tax purposes, the Circuit Court in this case concluded the investment fund could be a \u201ctrade or business\u201d for ERISA purposes based on certain factors, including the fund\u2019s level of involvement in the management of its portfolio companies and the nature of its management fee arrangements. Litigation related to the Circuit Court\u2019s decision suggests that additional factors may be relevant for purposes of determining whether an investment fund could face \u201ccontrolled group\u201d liability under ERISA, including the structure of the investment and the nature of the fund\u2019s relationship with other affiliated investors and co-investors\nin the portfolio company. Moreover, regardless of whether an investment fund is determined to be a \u201ctrade or business\u201d for purposes of ERISA, a court might hold that one of the fund\u2019s portfolio companies could become jointly and severally liable for another portfolio company\u2019s unfunded pension liabilities pursuant to the ERISA \u201ccontrolled group\u201d rules, depending upon the relevant investment structures and ownership interests as noted above.\nInvestments in energy, manufacturing, infrastructure, real estate and certain other assets may expose us to increased environmental liabilities that are inherent in the ownership of real assets.\nOwnership of real assets in our funds or vehicles may increase our risk of liability under environmental laws that impose, regardless of fault, joint and several liability for the cost of remediating contamination and compensation for damages. In addition, changes in environmental laws or regulations (including climate change initiatives) or the environmental condition of an investment may create liabilities that did not exist at the time of acquisition. Even in cases where we are indemnified by a seller against liabilities arising out of violations of environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance as to the financial viability of the seller to satisfy such indemnities or our ability to achieve enforcement of such indemnities.\nInvestments by our funds in the power and energy industries involve various operational, construction, regulatory and market risks.\nThe development, operation and maintenance of power and energy generation facilities involves many risks, including, as applicable, labor issues, start-up\nrisks, breakdown or failure of facilities, lack of sufficient capital to maintain the facilities and the dependence on a specific fuel source. Power and energy generation facilities in which our funds invest are also subject to risks associated with volatility in the price of fuel sources and the impact of unusual or adverse weather conditions or other natural events, as well as the risk of performance below expected levels of output, efficiency or reliability. The occurrence of any such items could result in lost revenues and/or increased expenses. In turn, such developments could impair a portfolio company\u2019s ability to repay its debt or conduct its operations. We may also choose or be required to decommission a power generation facility or other asset. The decommissioning process could be protracted and result in the incurrence of significant financial and/or regulatory obligations or other uncertainties.\nOur power and energy sector portfolio companies may also face construction risks typical for power generation and related infrastructure businesses. Such developments could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and, under certain circumstances, could prevent completion of construction activities once undertaken. Delays in the completion of any power project may result in lost revenues or increased expenses, including higher operation and maintenance costs related to such portfolio company.\nThe power and energy sectors are the subject of substantial and complex laws, rules and regulation by various federal and state regulatory agencies. Failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations could result in the prevention of operation of certain facilities or the prevention of the sale of such a facility to a third party, as well as the loss of certain rate authority, refund liability, penalties and other remedies, all of which could result in additional costs to a portfolio company and adversely affect the investment results. In recent years, there has been an increased focus by investors and other market participants on climate change and energy sustainability, including potential alternatives to fossil fuels, and increased activism, including through divestment of existing investments, with respect to sustainability-focused investing by asset managers, which could have a negative impact on our ability to exit certain of our traditional energy investments or adversely affect the expected returns of new investment opportunities. The new administration has communicated a renewed focus on climate change policies and most recently re-joined\nthe Paris Agreement, which includes commitments from countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, among other commitments. Executive orders signed by the President placed a temporary moratorium on new oil and gas leasing on public lands and offshore waters. Any legislative efforts by the administration or the U.S. Congress to overturn or modify policies or regulations enacted by the prior administration and to place additional limitations on coal and gas electric generation, mining and/or exploration could adversely affect our traditional energy investments.\nOur businesses that invest in the energy industry also focus on investments in businesses involved in oil and gas exploration and development, which can be a speculative business involving a high degree of risk, including:\n\u2022\nthe use of new technologies, including hydraulic fracturing,\n\u2022\nreliance on estimates of oil and gas reserves in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir, and\n\u2022\nencountering unexpected formations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, equipment failures and other accidents in completing wells and otherwise, cratering, sour gas releases, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, adverse weather conditions, pollution, fires, spills and other environmental risks.\nIn addition, the performance of the investments made by our credit and equity funds in the energy and natural resources markets are also subject to a high degree of market risk, as such investments are likely to be directly or indirectly substantially dependent upon prevailing prices of oil, natural gas and other commodities. Oil and natural gas prices are subject to wide fluctuation in response to factors beyond the control of us or our funds\u2019 portfolio companies, including relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, the level of consumer product demand, weather conditions, climate change initiatives, governmental regulation, the price and availability of alternative fuels, political and economic conditions in oil producing countries, foreign supply of such commodities and overall domestic and foreign economic conditions. These factors make it difficult to predict future commodity price movements with any certainty.\nOur investments in infrastructure assets may expose us to increased risks that are inherent in the ownership of real assets.\nInvestments in infrastructure assets may expose us to increased risks that are inherent in the ownership of real assets. For example,\n\u2022\nOwnership of infrastructure assets may present risk of liability for personal and property injury or impose significant operating challenges and costs with respect to, for example, compliance with zoning, environmental or other applicable laws.\n\u2022\nInfrastructure asset investments may face construction risks including, without limitation: (a) labor disputes, shortages of material and skilled labor, or work stoppages, (b) slower than projected construction progress and the unavailability or late delivery of necessary equipment, (c) less than optimal coordination with public utilities in the relocation of their facilities, (d) adverse weather conditions and unexpected construction conditions, (e) accidents or the breakdown or failure of construction equipment or processes, and (f) catastrophic events such as explosions, fires, terrorist activities and other similar events. These risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses (which may exceed expected or forecasted budgets) and, under certain circumstances, could prevent completion of construction activities once undertaken. Certain infrastructure asset investments may remain in construction phases for a prolonged period and, accordingly, may not be cash generative for a prolonged period. Recourse against the contractor may be subject to liability caps or may be subject to default or insolvency on the part of the contractor.\n\u2022\nThe operation of infrastructure assets is exposed to potential unplanned interruptions caused by significant catastrophic or force majeure events. These risks could, among other effects, adversely impact the cash flows available from investments in infrastructure assets, cause personal injury or loss of life, damage property, or instigate disruptions of service. In addition, the cost of repairing or replacing damaged assets could be considerable. Repeated or prolonged service interruptions may result in permanent loss of customers, litigation, or penalties for regulatory or contractual non-compliance.\nForce majeure events that are incapable of, or too costly to, cure may also have a permanent adverse effect on an investment.\n\u2022\nThe management of the business or operations of an infrastructure asset may be contracted to a third party management company unaffiliated with us. Although it would be possible to replace any such operator, the failure of such an operator to adequately perform its duties or to act in ways that are in our best interest, or the breach by an operator of applicable agreements or laws, rules and regulations, could have an adverse effect on the investment\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. Infrastructure investments may involve the subcontracting of design and construction activities in respect of projects, and as a result our investments are subject to the risks that contractual provisions passing liabilities to a subcontractor could be ineffective, the subcontractor fails to perform services which it has agreed to perform and the subcontractor becomes insolvent.\nInfrastructure investments often involve an ongoing commitment to a municipal, state, federal or foreign government or regulatory agencies. The nature of these obligations expose us to a higher level of regulatory control than typically imposed on other businesses and may require us to rely on complex government licenses, concessions, leases or contracts, which may be difficult to obtain or maintain. Infrastructure investments may require operators to manage such investments and such operators\u2019 failure to comply with laws, including prohibitions against bribing of government officials, may adversely affect the value of such investments and cause us serious reputational and legal harm. Revenues for such investments may rely on contractual agreements for the provision of services with a limited number of counterparties, and are consequently subject to counterparty default risk. The operations and cash flow of infrastructure investments are also more sensitive to inflation and, in certain cases, commodity price risk. Furthermore, services provided by infrastructure investments may be subject to rate regulations by government entities that determine or limit prices that may be charged. Similarly, users of applicable services or government entities in response to such users may react negatively to any adjustments in rates and thus reduce the profitability of such infrastructure investments.\nOur investments in the life science industry may expose us to increased risks.\nInvestments by BXLS, a private investment platform with capabilities to invest across the life cycle of companies and products within the key life sciences sectors, may expose us to increased risks. For example,\n\u2022\nBXLS\u2019s strategies include, among others, investments that are referred to as \u201cpharmaceutical corporate partnership\u201d transactions. Pharmaceutical corporate partnership transactions are risk-sharing collaborations with large biopharmaceutical and medical device partners on drug and medical device development programs and investments in royalty streams of pre-commercial\nbiopharmaceutical products. BXLS\u2019s ability to source pharmaceutical corporate partnership transactions has been, and will continue to be, in part dependent on the ability of special purpose development companies to identify, diligence, negotiate and in many cases, take the lead in executing the agreed development plans with respect to, a pharmaceutical corporate partnership transaction. Moreover, as such special purpose development companies are jointly owned by us or our affiliates and unaffiliated life sciences investors, we (and our funds) are not the sole beneficiaries of such sourcing strategies and capabilities of such special purpose development companies.\n\u2022\nLife sciences and healthcare companies are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, similar foreign regulatory authorities and, to a lesser extent, other federal and state agencies. These companies are subject to the expense, delay and uncertainty of the product approval process, and there can be no guarantee that a particular product candidate will obtain regulatory approval. In addition, the current regulatory framework may change or additional regulations may arise at any stage during the product development phase of an investment, which may delay or prevent regulatory approval or impact applicable exclusivity periods. If a company in which our funds are invested is unable to obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, or a product candidate in which our funds are invested does not obtain regulatory approval, in a timely fashion or at all, the value of our investment would be adversely impacted. In addition, in connection with certain pharmaceutical corporate partnership transactions, our special purpose development companies will be contractually obligated to run clinical trials. Further, a clinical trial (including enrollment therein) or regulatory approval process for pharmaceuticals has and may in the future be delayed, otherwise hindered or abandoned as a result of epidemics (including COVID-19),\nwhich could have a negative impact on the ability of the investment to engage in trials or receive approvals, and thereby could adversely affect the performance of the investment. In the event such clinical trials do not comply with the complicated regulatory requirements applicable thereto, such special purpose development companies may be subject to regulatory actions. In addition, if legislation is passed in the U.S. that reduces applicable exclusivity periods for drug or medical device products, this reform could result in price reductions at an earlier stage of a product\u2019s life cycle than originally estimated by BXLS, which could reduce the cumulative financial returns on BXLS\u2019s investment in any such product.\n\u2022\nIntellectual property often constitutes an important part of a life sciences company\u2019s assets and competitive strengths, particularly for royalty monetization transactions. To the extent such companies\u2019 intellectual property positions with respect to products in which BXLS invests, whether through a royalty monetization or otherwise, are challenged, invalidated or circumvented, the value of BXLS\u2019s investment may be impaired. The success of a life sciences investment depends in part on the ability of the biopharmaceutical or medical device companies in whose products BXLS invests to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of such products. The patent positions of such companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions.\n\u2022\nThe commercial success of products could be compromised if governmental or third party payers do not provide coverage and reimbursement, breach, rescind or modify their contracts or reimbursement policies or delay payments for such products. In both the U.S. and foreign markets, the successful sale of a life sciences company\u2019s product depends on the ability to obtain and maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement from third party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance\nplans. Governments and third party payers continue to pursue aggressive initiatives to contain costs and manage drug utilization and are increasingly focused on the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments, which could result in lower reimbursement rates and narrower populations for whom the products in which BXLS invests will be reimbursed by payers. The new administration may seek to modify coverage and reimbursement policies for life sciences companies\u2019 products; however, it remains unclear how and when, if at all, the administration will take such actions. To the extent an investment made by BXLS relies in whole or in part on royalties or other payments based on product sales, adequate third party payer reimbursement may not be available to enable price levels for the product sufficient for BXLS to realize an appropriate return on the investment.\nOur provision of products and services to insurance companies, including through Blackstone Insurance Solutions, subjects us to a variety of risks and uncertainties.\nBlackstone Insurance Solutions (\u201cBIS\u201d) is a platform that we established to combine insurance asset management expertise with Blackstone\u2019s diverse set of products to provide tailored solutions for insurance companies worldwide. BIS seeks to deliver to insurance companies customizable and diversified portfolios of Blackstone products across asset classes, as well as the option for partial or full management of insurance companies\u2019 general account assets, and is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. For example, BIS currently manages assets for Fidelity & Guaranty Life Insurance Company and certain of its affiliates pursuant to several investment management agreements. In addition, in July 2016, Blackstone and AXIS Capital co-sponsored\nthe establishment of Harrington Reinsurance, a Bermuda property and casualty reinsurance company, and BIS currently manages all general account assets of Harrington Reinsurance. BIS also manages or sub-manages\nassets for certain insurance-dedicated funds and special purpose vehicles, and has developed, and expects to continue to develop, other capital-efficient products for insurance companies. The success of BIS will depend in large part on further developing investment partnerships with insurance company clients and maintaining existing asset management arrangements, including those described above. If we fail to deliver high-quality, high-performing products that help our insurance company clients meet long-term policyholder obligations, BIS may not be successful in retaining existing investment partnerships, developing new investment partnerships or selling its capital-efficient products and such failure may have a material adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition.\nThe U.S. and non-U.S.\ninsurance industries are subject to significant regulatory oversight. Regulatory authorities in many relevant jurisdictions have broad regulatory (including through any regulatory support organization), administrative, and in some cases discretionary, authority with respect to insurance companies and/or their investment advisors, which may include, among other things, the investments insurance companies may acquire and hold, marketing practices, affiliate transactions, reserve requirements and capital adequacy. These requirements are primarily concerned with the protection of policyholders, and regulatory authorities often have wide discretion in applying the relevant restrictions and regulations to insurance companies, which may indirectly affect BIS and other Blackstone businesses that offer products or services to insurance companies. We may be the target or subject of, or may have indemnification obligations related to, litigation (including class action litigation by policyholders), enforcement investigations or regulatory scrutiny. Regulators and other authorities generally have the power to bring administrative or judicial proceedings against insurance companies, which could result in, among other things, suspension or revocation of licenses, cease-and-desist\norders, fines, civil penalties, criminal penalties or other disciplinary action. To the extent BIS or another Blackstone business that offers products or services to insurance companies is directly or indirectly involved in such regulatory actions, our reputation could be harmed, we may become liable for indemnification obligations and we could potentially be subject to enforcement actions, fines and penalties.\nSome of the arrangements we have or will develop with insurance companies involve complex U.S. and non-U.S.\ntax structures for which no clear precedent or authority may be available. Such structures may be subject to potential regulatory, legislative, judicial or administrative change or scrutiny and differing interpretations and any adverse regulatory, legislative, judicial or administrative changes, scrutiny or interpretations may result in substantial costs to insurance companies or BIS. In some cases we may agree to indemnify insurance companies for their losses resulting from any such adverse changes or interpretations.\nInsurance company investment portfolios are often subject to internal and regulatory requirements governing the categories and ratings of investment products and assets they may acquire and hold. Many of the investment products we develop for, or other assets or investments we include in, insurance company portfolios will be rated and a ratings downgrade or any other negative action by a rating agency with respect to such products, assets or investments could make them less attractive and limit our ability to offer such products to, or invest or deploy capital on behalf of, insurers.\nAny failure to properly manage or address the foregoing risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, results and financial condition.\nThe financial projections of our funds\u2019 portfolio companies could prove inaccurate.\nThe capital structure of a fund\u2019s portfolio company is generally set up at the time of the fund\u2019s investment in the portfolio company based on, among other factors, financial projects prepared by the portfolio company\u2019s management. These projected operating results will normally be based primarily on judgments of the management of the portfolio companies. In all cases, projections are only estimates of future results that are based upon assumptions made at the time that the projections are developed. General economic conditions, which are not predictable, along with other factors may cause actual performance to fall short of such the financial projections. Because of the leverage we typically employ in our investments, this could cause a substantial decrease in the value of our equity holdings in the portfolio company. The inaccuracy of financial projections could thus cause our funds\u2019 performance to fall short of our expectations.\nContingent liabilities could harm fund performance.\nWe may cause our funds to acquire an investment that is subject to contingent liabilities. Such contingent liabilities could be unknown to us at the time of acquisition or, if they are known to us, we may not accurately assess or protect against the risks that they present. Acquired contingent liabilities could thus result in unforeseen losses for our funds. In addition, in connection with the disposition of an investment in a portfolio company, a fund may be required to make representations about the business and financial affairs of such portfolio company typical of those made in connection with the sale of a business. A fund may also be required to indemnify the purchasers of such investment to the extent that any such representations are inaccurate. These arrangements may result in the incurrence of contingent liabilities by a fund, even after the disposition of an investment. Accordingly, the inaccuracy of representations and warranties made by a fund could harm such fund\u2019s performance.\nOur funds may be forced to dispose of investments at a disadvantageous time.\nOur funds may make investments of which they do not advantageously dispose of prior to the date the applicable fund is dissolved, either by expiration of such fund\u2019s term or otherwise. Although we generally expect that our funds will dispose of investments prior to dissolution or that investments will be suitable for in-kind\ndistribution at dissolution, we may not be able to do so. The general partners of our funds have only a limited ability to extend the term of the fund with the consent of fund investors or the advisory board of the fund, as applicable, and therefore, we may be required to sell, distribute or otherwise dispose of investments at a disadvantageous time prior to dissolution. This would result in a lower than expected return on the investments and, perhaps, on the fund itself.\nHedge fund investments are subject to numerous additional risks.\nInvestments by our funds of hedge funds in other hedge funds, as well as investments by our credit-focused, real estate debt and other hedge funds and similar products, are subject to numerous additional risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nCertain of the funds in which we invest are newly established funds without any operating history or are managed by management companies or general partners who may not have as significant track records as an independent manager.\n\u2022\nGenerally, the execution of these hedge funds\u2019 investment strategies is subject to the sole discretion of the management company or the general partner of such funds.\n\u2022\nHedge funds may engage in speculative trading strategies, including short selling, which is subject to the theoretically unlimited risk of loss because there is no limit on how much the price of a security may appreciate before the short position is closed out. A fund may be subject to losses if a security lender demands return of the lent securities and an alternative lending source cannot be found or if the fund is otherwise unable to borrow securities that are necessary to hedge or cover its positions.\n\u2022\nHedge funds are exposed to the risk that a counterparty will not settle a transaction in accordance with its terms and conditions because of a dispute over the terms of the contract (whether or not bona fide) or because of a credit or liquidity problem or otherwise, thus causing the fund to suffer a loss. Counterparty risk is accentuated for contracts with longer maturities where events may intervene to prevent settlement, or where the fund has concentrated its transactions with a single or small group of counterparties. Generally, hedge funds are not restricted from dealing with any particular counterparty or from concentrating any or all of their transactions with one counterparty. Moreover, the funds\u2019 internal consideration of the creditworthiness of their counterparties may prove insufficient. The absence of a regulated market to facilitate settlement may increase the potential for losses.\n\u2022\nCredit risk may arise through a default by one of several large institutions that are dependent on one another to meet their liquidity or operational needs, so that a default by one institution causes a series of defaults by the other institutions. This \u201csystemic risk\u201d may adversely affect the financial intermediaries (such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges) with which the hedge funds interact on a daily basis.\n\u2022\nThe efficacy of investment and trading strategies depend largely on the ability to establish and maintain an overall market position in a combination of financial instruments. A hedge fund\u2019s trading orders may not be executed in a timely and efficient manner due to various circumstances, including systems failures or human error. In such event, the funds might only be able to acquire some but not all of the components of the position, or if the overall position were to need adjustment, the funds might not be able to make such adjustment. As a result, the funds would not be able to achieve the market position selected by the management company or general partner of such funds, and might incur a loss in liquidating their position.\n\u2022\nHedge funds are subject to risks due to potential illiquidity of assets. Hedge funds may make investments or hold trading positions in markets that are volatile and which may become illiquid. Timely divestiture or sale of trading positions can be impaired by decreased trading volume, increased price volatility, concentrated trading positions, limitations on the ability to transfer positions in highly specialized or structured transactions to which they may be a party, and changes in industry and government regulations. It may be impossible or costly for hedge funds to liquidate positions rapidly in order to meet margin calls, withdrawal requests or otherwise, particularly if there are other market participants seeking to dispose of similar assets at the same time or the relevant market is otherwise moving against a position or in the event of trading halts or daily price movement limits on the market or otherwise. Any \u201cgate\u201d or similar limitation on withdrawals with respect to hedge funds may not be effective in mitigating such risk. Moreover, these risks may be exacerbated for our funds of hedge funds. For example, if one of our funds of hedge funds were to invest a significant portion of its assets in two or more hedge funds that each had illiquid positions in the same issuer, the illiquidity risk for our funds of hedge funds would be compounded. For example, in 2008 many hedge funds, including some of our hedge funds, experienced significant declines in value. In many cases, these declines in value were both provoked and exacerbated by margin calls and forced selling of assets. Moreover, certain of our funds of hedge funds were invested in third party hedge funds that halted redemptions in the face of illiquidity and other issues, which precluded those funds of hedge funds from receiving their capital back on request.\n\u2022\nHedge fund investments are subject to risks relating to investments in commodities, futures, options and other derivatives, the prices of which are highly volatile and may be subject to the theoretically unlimited risk of loss in certain circumstances, including if the fund writes a call option. Price movements of commodities, futures and options contracts and payments pursuant to swap agreements are influenced by, among other things, interest rates, changing supply and demand relationships, trade, fiscal, monetary and exchange control programs and policies of governments and national and international political and economic events and policies. The value of futures, options and swap agreements also depends upon the price of the commodities underlying them and prevailing exchange rates. In addition, hedge funds\u2019 assets are subject to the risk of the failure of any of the exchanges on which their positions trade or of their clearinghouses or counterparties. Most U.S. commodities exchanges limit fluctuations in certain commodity interest prices during a single day by imposing \u201cdaily price fluctuation limits\u201d or \u201cdaily limits,\u201d the existence of which may reduce liquidity or effectively curtail trading in particular markets.\nAs a result of their affiliation with us, our hedge funds may from time to time be restricted from trading in certain securities (e.g., publicly traded securities issued by our current or potential portfolio companies). This may limit their ability to acquire and/or subsequently dispose of investments in connection with transactions that would otherwise generally be permitted in the absence of such affiliation.\nWe are subject to risks in using prime brokers, custodians, counterparties, administrators and other agents.\nMany of our funds depend on the services of prime brokers, custodians, counterparties, administrators and other agents to carry out certain securities and derivatives transactions. The terms of these contracts are often customized and complex, and many of these arrangements occur in markets or relate to products that are not subject to regulatory oversight, although the Dodd-Frank Act provides for regulation of the derivatives market. In particular, some of our funds utilize prime brokerage arrangements with a relatively limited number of counterparties, which has the effect of concentrating the transaction volume (and related counterparty default risk) of these funds with these counterparties.\nOur funds are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these contracts defaults, either voluntarily or involuntarily, on its performance under the contract. Any such default may occur suddenly and without notice to us. Moreover, if a counterparty defaults, we may be unable to take action to cover our exposure, either because we lack contractual recourse or because market conditions make it difficult to take effective action. This inability could occur in times of market stress, which is when defaults are most likely to occur.\nIn addition, our risk management process may not accurately anticipate the impact of market stress or counterparty financial condition, and as a result, we may not have taken sufficient action to reduce our risks effectively. Default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect, foresee or evaluate. In addition, concerns about, or a default by, one large participant could lead to significant liquidity problems for other participants, which may in turn expose us to significant losses.\nAlthough we have risk management processes to ensure that we are not exposed to a single counterparty for significant periods of time, given the large number and size of our funds, we often have large positions with a single counterparty. For example, most of our funds have credit lines. If the lender under one or more of those credit lines were to become insolvent, we may have difficulty replacing the credit line and one or more of our funds may face liquidity problems.\nIn the event of a counterparty default, particularly a default by a major investment bank or a default by a counterparty to a significant number of our contracts, one or more of our funds may have outstanding trades that they cannot settle or are delayed in settling. As a result, these funds could incur material losses and the resulting market impact of a major counterparty default could harm our businesses, results of operation and financial condition.\nIn the event of the insolvency of a prime broker, custodian, counterparty or any other party that is holding assets of our funds as collateral, our funds might not be able to recover equivalent assets in full as they will rank among the prime broker\u2019s, custodian\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s unsecured creditors in relation to the assets held as collateral. In addition, our funds\u2019 cash held with a prime broker, custodian or counterparty generally will not be segregated from the prime broker\u2019s, custodian\u2019s or counterparty\u2019s own cash, and our funds may therefore rank as unsecured creditors in relation thereto. If our derivatives transactions are cleared through a derivatives clearing organization, the CFTC has issued final rules regulating the segregation and protection of collateral posted by customers of cleared and uncleared swaps. The CFTC is also working to provide new guidance regarding prime broker arrangements and intermediation generally with regard to trading on swap execution facilities.\nThe counterparty risks that we face have increased in complexity and magnitude as a result of disruption in the financial markets in recent years. For example, in certain areas the number of counterparties we face has increased and may continue to increase, which may result in increased complexity and monitoring costs. Conversely, in certain other areas, the consolidation and elimination of counterparties has increased our concentration of counterparty risk and decreased the universe of potential counterparties, and our funds are generally not restricted from dealing with any particular counterparty or from concentrating any or all of their transactions with one counterparty. In addition, counterparties have in the past and may in the future react to market volatility by tightening underwriting standards and increasing margin requirements for all categories of financing, which may decrease the overall amount of leverage available and increase the costs of borrowing.\nUnderwriting activities by our capital markets services business expose us to risks.\nBlackstone Securities Partners L.P. may act as an underwriter, syndicator or placement agent in securities offerings and, through affiliated entities, loan syndications. We may incur losses and be subject to reputational harm to the extent that, for any reason, we are unable to sell securities or indebtedness we purchased or placed as an underwriter, syndicator or placement agent at the anticipated price levels or at all. As an underwriter, syndicator or placement agent, we also may be subject to liability for material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses and other offering documents relating to offerings we underwrite, syndicate or place.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure\nThe significant voting power of holders of our Series I preferred stock and Series II preferred stock may limit the ability of holders of our common stock to influence our business.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to vote pursuant to Delaware law with respect to:\n\u2022\nA conversion of the legal entity form of Blackstone,\n\u2022\nA transfer, domestication or continuance of Blackstone to a foreign jurisdiction,\n\u2022\nAny amendment of our certificate of incorporation to change the par value of our common stock or the powers, preferences or special rights of our common stock in a way that would affect our common stock adversely,\n\u2022\nAny amendment of our certificate of incorporation that requires for action the vote of a greater number or portion of the holders of common stock than is required by any section of Delaware law, and\n\u2022\nAny amendment of our certificate of incorporation to elect to become a close corporation under Delaware law.\nIn addition, our certificate of incorporation provides voting rights to holders of our common stock on the following additional matters:\n\u2022\nA sale, exchange or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets,\n\u2022\nA merger, consolidation or other business combination,\n\u2022\nAny amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws enlarging the obligations of the common stockholders,\n\u2022\nAny amendment of our certificate of incorporation requiring the vote of the holders of a percentage of the voting power of the outstanding common stock and Series I preferred stock, voting together as a single class, to take any action in a manner that would have the effect of reducing such voting percentage, and\n\u2022\nAny amendments of our certificate of incorporation that are not included in the specified set of amendments that the Series II Preferred Stockholder has the sole right to vote on.\nFurthermore, our certificate of incorporation provides that the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of common stock and Series I preferred stock may vote to require the Series II Preferred Stockholder to transfer its shares of Series II preferred stock to a successor Series II Preferred Stockholder designated by the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of common stock and Series I preferred stock.\nOther matters that are required to be submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock generally require the approval of a majority the voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock and Series I preferred stock, voting together as a single class, including certain sales, exchanges or other dispositions of all or substantially all of our assets, a merger, consolidation or other business combination, certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and the designation of a successor Series II Preferred Stockholder. Holders of our Series I preferred stock, as such, will collectively be entitled to a number of votes equal to the aggregate number of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units held by the limited partners of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships on the relevant record date and will vote together with holders of our common stock as a single class. As of February 19, 2021, Blackstone Partners L.L.C., an entity owned by the senior managing directors of Blackstone and controlled by Mr. Schwarzman, owned the only share of Series I preferred stock outstanding, representing approximately 41.7% of the total combined voting power of the common stock and Series I preferred stock, taken together.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain additional provisions affecting the holders of our common stock, including certain limits on the ability of the holders of our common stock to call meetings, to acquire information about our operations and to influence the manner or direction of our management. In addition, any person that beneficially owns 20% or more of the common stock then outstanding (other than the Series II Preferred Stockholder or its affiliates, a direct or subsequently approved transferee of the Series II Preferred Stockholder or its affiliates or a person or group that has acquired such stock with the prior approval of our board of directors) is unable to vote such stock on any matter submitted to such stockholders.\nWe are not required to comply with certain provisions of U.S. securities laws relating to proxy statements and certain related matters.\nWe are not required to file proxy statements or information statements under Section 14 of the Exchange Act except in circumstances where a vote of holders of our common stock is required under our certificate of incorporation or Delaware law, such as a merger, business combination or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, we will generally not be subject to the \u201csay-on-pay\u201d\nand \u201csay-on-frequency\u201d\nprovisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. As a result, our common shareholders do not have an opportunity to provide a non-binding\nvote on the compensation of our named executive officers. Moreover, holders of our common stock are not able to bring matters before our annual meeting of shareholders or nominate directors at such meeting, nor are they generally able to submit shareholder proposals under Rule 14a-8\nof the Exchange Act.\nWe are a controlled company and as a result qualify for some exceptions from certain corporate governance and other requirements of the New York Stock Exchange.\nBecause the Series II Preferred Stockholder holds more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and fall within exceptions from certain corporate governance and other requirements of the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. Pursuant to these exceptions, controlled companies may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange,\nincluding the requirements (a) that a majority of our board of directors consist of independent directors, (b) that we have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors (c) that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors, and (d) that the compensation committee be required to consider certain independence factors when engaging compensation consultants, legal counsel and other committee advisers. While we currently have a majority independent board of directors, we have elected to avail ourselves of the other exceptions. Accordingly, our common stockholders generally do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE.\nPotential conflicts of interest may arise among the Series II Preferred Stockholder and the holders of our common stock.\nBlackstone Group Management L.L.C., an entity owned by senior managing directors of Blackstone and controlled by Mr. Schwarzman, is the sole holder of the Series II Preferred stock. As a result, conflicts of interest may arise among the Series II Preferred Stockholder, on the one hand, and us and our holders of our common stock, on the other hand.\nThe Series II Preferred Stockholder has the ability to influence our business and affairs through its ownership of Series II Preferred stock, the Series II Preferred Stockholder\u2019s general ability to appoint our board of directors, and provisions under our certificate of incorporation requiring Series II Preferred Stockholder approval for certain corporate actions (in addition to approval by our board of directors). If the holders of our common stock are dissatisfied with the performance of our board of directors, they have no ability to remove any of our directors, with or without cause.\nFurther, through its ability to elect our board of directors, the Series II Preferred Stockholder has the ability to indirectly influence the determination of the amount and timing of our investments and dispositions, cash expenditures, indebtedness, issuances of additional partnership interests, tax liabilities and amounts of reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is available for distribution to holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units.\nIn addition, conflicts may arise relating to the selection, structuring and disposition of investments and other transactions, declaring dividends and other distributions and other matters due to the fact that our senior managing directors hold their Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units directly or through pass-through entities that are not subject to corporate income taxation. See \u201cPart III. Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\u201d and \u201cPart III. Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.\u201d\nOur certificate of incorporation states that the Series II Preferred Stockholder is under no obligation to consider the separate interests of the other stockholders and contains provisions limiting the liability of the Series II Preferred Stockholder.\nSubject to applicable law, our certificate of incorporation contains provisions limiting the duties owed by the holder of our Series II preferred stock and contains provisions allowing the Series II Preferred Stockholder to favor its own interests and the interests of its controlling persons over us and the holders of our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation contains provisions stating that the Series II Preferred Stockholder is under no obligation to consider the separate interests of the other stockholders (including, without limitation, the tax consequences to such stockholders) in deciding whether or not to authorize us to take (or decline to authorize us to take) any action as well as provisions stating that the Series II Preferred Stockholder shall not be liable to the other stockholders for damages for any losses, liabilities or benefits not derived by such stockholders in connection with such decisions. See \u201c- Potential conflicts of interest may arise among the Series II Preferred Stockholder and the holders of our common stock.\u201d\nThe Series II Preferred Stockholder will not be liable to Blackstone or holders of our common stock for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and non-appealable\njudgment determining that the Series II Preferred Stockholder acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct and we have also agreed to indemnify the Series II Preferred Stockholder to a similar extent.\nEven if there is deemed to be a breach of the obligations set forth in our certificate of incorporation, our certificate of incorporation provides that the Series II Preferred Stockholder will not be liable to us or the holders of our common stock for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and non-appealable\njudgment by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the Series II Preferred Stockholder or its officers and directors acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct. These provisions are detrimental to the holders of our common stock because they restrict the remedies available to stockholders for actions of the Series II Preferred Stockholder.\nIn addition, we have agreed to indemnify the Series II Preferred Stockholder and our former general partner and its controlling affiliates and any current or former officer or director of any of Blackstone or its subsidiaries, the Series II Preferred Stockholder or former general partner and certain other specified persons (collectively, the \u201cIndemnitees\u201d), to the fullest extent permitted by law, against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties, interest, settlements or other amounts incurred by any Indemnitee. We have agreed to provide this indemnification if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and with respect to any alleged conduct resulting in a criminal proceeding against the Indemnitee, such person had no reasonable cause to believe that such person\u2019s conduct was unlawful. We have also agreed to provide this indemnification for criminal proceedings.\nThe Series II Preferred Stockholder may transfer its interest in the sole share of Series II preferred stock which could materially alter our operations.\nWithout the approval of any other stockholder, the Series II Preferred Stockholder may transfer the sole outstanding share of our Series II preferred stock held by it to a third party upon receipt of approval to do so by our board of directors and satisfaction of certain other requirements. Further, the members or other interest holders of the Series II Preferred Stockholder may sell or transfer all or part of their outstanding equity or other interests in the Series II Preferred Stockholder at any time without our approval. A new holder of our Series II preferred stock or new controlling members of the Series II Preferred Stockholder may appoint directors to our board of directors who have a different philosophy and/or investment objectives from those of our current directors. A new holder of our Series II Preferred stock, new controlling members of the Series II Preferred Stockholder and/or the directors they appoint to our board of directors could also have a different philosophy for the management of our business, including the hiring and compensation of our investment professionals. If any of the foregoing were to occur, we could experience difficulty in forming new funds and other investment vehicles and in making new investments, and the value of our existing investments, our business, our results of operations and our financial condition could materially suffer.\nWe intend to pay regular dividends to holders of our common stock, but our ability to do so may be limited by cash flow from operations and available liquidity, our holding company structure, applicable provisions of Delaware law and contractual restrictions.\nOur intention to pay to holders of common stock a quarterly dividend representing approximately 85% of The Blackstone Group Inc.\u2019s share of Distributable Earnings, subject to adjustment by amounts determined by Blackstone\u2019s board of directors to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of its business, to make appropriate investments in its business and our funds, to comply with applicable law, any of its debt instruments or other agreements, or to provide for future cash requirements such as tax-related\npayments, clawback obligations and dividends to stockholders for any ensuing quarter. All of the foregoing is subject to the qualification that the declaration and payment of any dividends are at the sole discretion of our board of directors, and may change at any time, including, without limitation, to reduce such quarterly dividends or to eliminate such dividends entirely.\nThe Blackstone Group Inc. is a holding company and has no material assets other than the ownership of the partnership units in Blackstone Holdings held through wholly owned subsidiaries. The Blackstone Group Inc. has no independent means of generating revenue. Accordingly, we intend to cause Blackstone Holdings to make distributions to its partners, including The Blackstone Group Inc.\u2019s wholly owned subsidiaries, to fund any dividends The Blackstone Group Inc. may declare on our common stock.\nOur ability to make dividends to our stockholders will depend on a number of factors, including among others general economic and business conditions, our strategic plans and prospects, our business and investment opportunities, our financial condition and operating results, including the timing and extent of our realizations, working capital requirements and anticipated cash needs, contractual restrictions and obligations including fulfilling our current and future capital commitments, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, restrictions and other implications on the payment of dividends by us to holders of our common stock or payment of distributions by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. Our ability to pay dividends is also subject to the availability of lawful funds therefor as determined in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law.\nThe amortization of finite-lived intangible assets and non-cash\nequity-based compensation results in expenses that may increase the net loss we record in certain periods or cause us to record a net loss in periods during which we would otherwise have recorded net income.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have $348.0 million of finite-lived intangible assets (in addition to $1.9 billion of goodwill), net of accumulated amortization. These finite-lived intangible assets are from the initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) and subsequent business acquisitions. We are amortizing these finite-lived intangibles over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to twenty years, using the straight-line method, with a weighted-average remaining amortization period of 7.9 years as of December 31, 2020. We also record non-cash\nequity-based compensation from grants made in the ordinary course of business and in connection with other business acquisitions. The amortization of these finite-lived intangible assets and of this non-cash\nequity-based compensation will increase our expenses during the relevant periods. These expenses may increase the net loss we record in certain periods or cause us to record a net loss in periods during which we would otherwise have recorded net income. A substantial and sustained decline in our share price could result in an impairment of intangible assets or goodwill leading to a further reduction in net income or increase to net loss in the relevant period.\nWe are required to pay our senior managing directors for most of the benefits relating to any additional tax depreciation or amortization deductions we may claim as a result of the tax basis step-up\nwe received as part of the reorganization we implemented in connection with our IPO or receive in connection with future exchanges of our common stock and related transactions.\nAs part of the reorganization we implemented in connection with our IPO, we purchased interests in our business from our pre-IPO\nowners. In addition, holders of partnership units in Blackstone Holdings (other than The Blackstone Group Inc.\u2019s wholly owned subsidiaries), subject to the vesting and minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer restrictions set forth in the partnership agreements of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships, may up to four times each year (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement) exchange their Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units for shares of The Blackstone Group Inc.\u2019s common stock on a one-for-one\nbasis. A Blackstone Holdings limited partner must exchange one partnership unit in each of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships to effect an exchange for a share of common stock. The purchase and subsequent exchanges are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Blackstone Holdings that otherwise would not have been available. These increases in tax basis may increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization and therefore reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although the IRS may challenge all or part of that tax basis increase, and a court could sustain such a challenge.\nWe have entered into a tax receivable agreement with our senior managing directors and other pre-IPO\nowners that provides for the payment by us to the counterparties of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax or franchise tax that we actually realize as a result of these increases in tax basis and of certain other tax benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. In addition, additional tax receivable agreements have been executed, and others may continue to be executed, with newly-admitted Blackstone senior managing directors and certain others who receive Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. This payment obligation is an obligation of The Blackstone Group Inc. and/or its wholly owned subsidiaries and not of Blackstone Holdings. As such, the cash distributions to public stockholders may vary from holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units (held by Blackstone personnel and others) to the extent payments are made under the tax receivable agreements to selling holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. As the payments reflect actual tax savings received by Blackstone entities, there may be a timing difference between the tax savings received by Blackstone entities and the cash payments to selling holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. While the actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under this agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges, the price of our common stock at the time of the exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable and the amount and timing of our income, we expect that as a result of the size of the increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Blackstone Holdings, the payments that we may make under the tax receivable agreements will be substantial. The payments under a tax receivable agreement are not conditioned upon a tax receivable agreement counterparty\u2019s continued ownership of us. We may need to incur debt to finance payments under the tax receivable agreement to the extent our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the tax receivable agreements as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise.\nAlthough we are not aware of any issue that would cause the IRS to challenge a tax basis increase, the tax receivable agreement counterparties will not reimburse us for any payments previously made under the tax receivable agreement. As a result, in certain circumstances payments to the counterparties under the tax receivable agreement could be in excess of our actual cash tax savings. Our ability to achieve benefits from any tax basis increase, and the payments to be made under the tax receivable agreements, will depend upon a number of factors, as discussed above, including the timing and amount of our future income.\nIf The Blackstone Group Inc. were deemed an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the 1940 Act, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAn entity will generally be deemed to be an \u201cinvestment company\u201d for purposes of the 1940 Act if: (a) it is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities, or (b) absent an applicable exemption, it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We believe that we are engaged primarily in the business of providing asset management and capital markets services and not in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. We also believe that the primary source of income from each of our businesses is properly characterized as income earned in exchange for the provision of services. We hold ourselves out as an asset management and capital markets firm and do not propose to engage primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Accordingly, we do not believe that The Blackstone Group Inc. is an \u201corthodox\u201d investment company as defined in section 3(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act and described in clause (a) in the first sentence of this paragraph. Furthermore, The Blackstone Group Inc. does not have any material assets other than its equity interests in certain wholly owned subsidiaries, which in turn will have no material assets (other than intercompany debt) other than general partner interests in the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships. These wholly owned subsidiaries are the sole general partners of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships and are vested with all management and control over the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships. We do not believe the equity interests of The Blackstone Group Inc. in its wholly owned subsidiaries or the general partner interests of these wholly owned subsidiaries in the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships are investment securities. Moreover, because we believe that the capital interests of the general partners of our funds in their respective funds are neither securities nor investment securities, we believe that less than 40% of The Blackstone Group Inc.\u2019s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis are comprised of assets that could be considered investment securities. Accordingly, we do not believe The Blackstone Group Inc. is an inadvertent investment company by virtue of the 40% test in section 3(a)(1)(C) of the 1940 Act as described in clause (b) in the first sentence of this paragraph. In addition, we believe The Blackstone Group Inc. is not an investment company under section 3(b)(1) of the 1940 Act because it is primarily engaged in a non-investment\ncompany business.\nThe 1940 Act and the rules thereunder contain detailed parameters for the organization and operation of investment companies. Among other things, the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder limit or prohibit transactions with affiliates, impose limitations on the issuance of debt and equity securities, generally prohibit the issuance of options and impose certain governance requirements. We intend to conduct our operations so that The Blackstone Group Inc. will not be deemed to be an investment company under the 1940 Act. If anything were to happen which would cause The Blackstone Group Inc. to be deemed to be an investment company under the 1940 Act, requirements imposed by the 1940 Act, including limitations on our capital structure, ability to transact business with affiliates (including us) and ability to compensate key employees, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as currently conducted, impair the agreements and arrangements between and among The Blackstone Group Inc., Blackstone Holdings and our senior managing directors, or any combination thereof, and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be required to limit the amount of investments that we make as a principal or otherwise conduct our business in a manner that does not subject us to the registration and other requirements of the 1940 Act.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Conversion or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected or not offset the costs of the Conversion, which could have a material and adverse impact on the trading price of our securities.\nWe believe that the Conversion has, among other things, made it significantly easier for both domestic and international investors to own our stock, expand our global investor base and drive greater value for all of our stockholders over time. However, over time, the level of investor interest in our common stock may not meet our expectations. For example, benchmark stock indices may change their eligibility requirements in a manner that is adverse to us or otherwise determine not to include our common stock. Moreover, even though we have simplified our tax structure and reporting as a result of the Conversion, and even if we succeed in having our shares included in additional key stock indices, this may not result in the sustained increased demand for our common stock that we initially anticipated. Consequently, we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Conversion or those benefits may take longer to realize than we expect. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the Conversion will offset its costs, which could be greater than we expect, particularly if there were to be an increase in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate. Our failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Conversion at all or in a timely manner, or a failure of any benefits realized to offset its costs, could have a material and adverse impact on the trading price of our securities.\nWe may from time to time undertake internal reorganizations that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOn July 1, 2019, we completed the Conversion. From time to time, we may undertake other internal reorganizations in an effort to simplify our organizational structure, streamline our operations or for other operational reasons. Such internal reorganization may involve, among other things, the combination or dissolution of certain of our existing subsidiaries and the creation of new subsidiaries. These transactions could be disruptive to our business, result in significant expense, require regulatory approvals, and fail to result in the intended or expected benefits, any of which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOther anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents could delay or prevent a change in control.\nIn addition to the provisions described elsewhere relating to the Series II Preferred Stockholder\u2019s control, other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable by, for example:\n\u2022\npermitting our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock,\n\u2022\nproviding for the loss of voting rights for the common stock,\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notice for stockholder proposals and nominations if they are ever permitted by applicable law,\n\u2022\nplacing limitations on convening stockholder meetings,\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent unless such action is consent to by the Series II Preferred Stockholder, and\n\u2022\nimposing super-majority voting requirements for certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation.\nThese provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control.\nWe expect to pay more corporate income taxes than we paid historically prior to the Conversion.\nSince our Conversion, all of the net income attributable to us is subject to U.S. federal (and state and local) corporate income taxes, which we anticipate will have a dilutive impact to Distributable Earnings per share of common stock and net income attributable to us and reduce the amount of cash available for dividends to our common stockholders, although this dilution should initially be mitigated by a tax basis step-up\nrelated to the Conversion. The currently enacted maximum U.S. federal corporate income tax rate is 21%. This rate may increase in the future, which would cause us to pay more corporate income taxes than currently anticipated.\nBecause all of The Blackstone Group Inc.\u2019s net income is subject to corporate income taxes, we expect the amount of our cash tax savings from future exchanges of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units for shares of common stock to increase as compared to the cash tax savings historically realized by the Partnership from such exchanges for common units. As a result, we expect the amount the Corporation will be required to pay under the tax receivable agreement (i.e., 85% of cash tax savings it realizes) will in the aggregate over time be higher for exchanges following the Conversion. This would similarly have the effect of increasing the amount of any early termination payment or the amounts due upon the occurrence of an acceleration event, which are determined in part by reference to amounts payable in respect of future exchanges.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock price may decline due to the large number of shares of common stock eligible for future sale and for exchange.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market in the future or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell shares of common stock in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. We had a total of 683,838,948 shares of common stock outstanding as of February 19, 2021. Subject to the lock-up\nrestrictions described below, we may issue and sell in the future additional shares of common stock. Limited partners of Blackstone Holdings owned an aggregate of 460,654,705 Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units outstanding as of February 19, 2021. In connection with our initial public offering, we entered into an exchange agreement with holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units (other than The Blackstone Group Inc.\u2019s wholly owned subsidiaries) so that these holders, subject to the vesting and minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer restrictions set forth in the partnership agreements of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships, may up to four times each year (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement) exchange their Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units for shares of The Blackstone Group Inc. common stock on a one-for-one\nbasis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for splits, unit distributions and reclassifications. A Blackstone Holdings limited partner must exchange one partnership unit in each of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships to effect an exchange for a share of common stock. The common stock we issue upon such exchanges would be \u201crestricted securities,\u201d as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, unless we register such issuances. However, we have entered into a registration rights agreement with the limited partners of Blackstone Holdings that requires us to register these shares of common stock under the Securities Act and we have filed registration statements that cover the delivery of common stock issued upon exchange of Blackstone\nHoldings Partnership Units. See \u201cPart III. Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence - Transactions with Related Persons - Registration Rights Agreement.\u201d While the partnership agreements of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships and related agreements contractually restrict the ability of Blackstone personnel to transfer the Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units or The Blackstone Group Inc. common stock they hold and require that they maintain a minimum amount of equity ownership during their employ by us, these contractual provisions may lapse over time or be waived, modified or amended at any time.\nAs of February 19, 2021, we had granted 27,360,917 outstanding deferred restricted shares of common stock and 27,854,499 outstanding deferred restricted Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units to our non-senior\nmanaging director professionals and senior managing directors under The Blackstone Group Inc. Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (\u201c2007 Equity Incentive Plan\u201d). The aggregate number of shares of common stock and Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units (together, \u201cShares\u201d) covered by our 2007 Equity Incentive Plan is increased on the first day of each fiscal year during its term by a number of Shares equal to the positive difference, if any, of (a) 15% of the aggregate number of Shares outstanding on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year (excluding Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units held by The Blackstone Group Inc. or its wholly owned subsidiaries) minus (b) the aggregate number of Shares covered by our 2007 Equity Incentive Plan as of such date (unless the administrator of the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan should decide to increase the number of Shares covered by the plan by a lesser amount). An aggregate of 168,638,826 additional Shares were available for grant under our 2007 Equity Incentive Plan as of February 19, 2021. We have filed a registration statement and intend to file additional registration statements on Form S-8\nunder the Securities Act to register common stock covered by the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (including pursuant to automatic annual increases). Any such Form S-8\nregistration statement will automatically become effective upon filing. Accordingly, common stock registered under such registration statement will be available for sale in the open market.\nIn addition, the Blackstone Holdings partnership agreements authorize the wholly owned subsidiaries of The Blackstone Group Inc. which are the general partners of those partnerships to issue an unlimited number of additional partnership securities of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships with such designations, preferences, rights, powers and duties that are different from, and may be senior to, those applicable to the Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units, and which may be exchangeable for our shares of common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation also provides us with a right to acquire all of the then outstanding shares of common stock under specified circumstances, which may adversely affect the price of our shares of common stock and the ability of holders of shares of common stock to participate in further growth in our stock price.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, if at any time, less than 10% of the total shares of any class our stock then outstanding (other than Series I preferred stock and Series II preferred stock) is held by persons other than the Series II Preferred Stockholder and its affiliates, we may exercise our right to call and purchase all of the then outstanding shares of common stock held by persons other than the Series II Preferred Stockholder or its affiliates or assign this right to the Series II Preferred Stockholder or any of its affiliates. As a result, a stockholder may have his or her shares of common stock purchased from him or her at an undesirable time or price and in a manner which adversely affects the ability of a stockholder to participate in further growth in our stock price.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the federal district courts of the United States of America, as applicable, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with Blackstone or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for: (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (b) any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers, stockholders or employees to us or our stockholders, (c) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (d) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nOur amended and restated bylaws further provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the federal securities laws of the United States, including, in each case, the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provision in our amended and restated bylaws. This choice-of-forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a different judicial forum, including one that it may find favorable or convenient for a specified class of disputes with Blackstone or our directors, officers, other stockholders or employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our amended and restated bylaws inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors.", "PERMNO": 92108, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "BX"}
