RISK FACTORS\nWhen evaluating the Company, the following discussion of risk factors, which contains forward-looking statements as discussed in Part I \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements\u201d above, should be considered in conjunction with the other information contained in this Annual Report. If we are unable to mitigate and/or are exposed to any of the following risks in the future, then there could be a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to general economic, business and regulatory factors affecting the truckload industry that are largely beyond our control, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe truckload industry is highly cyclical, and our business is dependent on a number of factors that may have a negative impact on our results of operations, many of which are beyond our control. We believe that some of the most significant of these factors are economic changes that affect supply and demand in transportation markets, such as:\n\uf0b7recessionary economic cycles, such as the period from 2007 through 2009;\n\uf0b7changes in customers\u2019 inventory levels and practices, including shrinking product/package sizes, and in the availability of funding for their working capital;\n\uf0b7excess truck capacity in comparison with shipping demand;\n\uf0b7driver shortages and increases in drivers\u2019 compensation;\n\uf0b7industry compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements;\n\uf0b7fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and imposition of domestic or foreign trade tariffs; and\n\uf0b7downturns in customers\u2019 business cycles, including as a result of declines in consumer spending.\nSeveral of the above factors were evident in the 2016 and 2019 freight environments, which led to higher inventories, weakened demand and pressure on rates. Similar conditions in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, economic conditions that decrease shipping demand or increase the supply of available tractors and trailers can exert downward pressure on rates and equipment utilization, thereby decreasing asset productivity. The risks associated with these factors are heightened when the U.S. economy is weakened. Some of the principal risks during such times are as follows:\n\uf0b7we may experience low overall freight levels, which may impair our asset utilization;\n\uf0b7certain of our customers may face credit issues and cash flow problems that may lead to payment delays, increased credit risk, bankruptcies and other financial hardships that could result in even lower freight demand and may require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts;\n\uf0b7freight patterns may change as supply chains are redesigned, resulting in an imbalance between our capacity and our customers\u2019 freight demand;\n\uf0b7customers may solicit bids for freight from multiple trucking companies or select competitors that offer lower rates from among existing choices in an attempt to lower their costs, and we might be forced to lower our rates or lose freight;\n\uf0b7we may be forced to accept more loads from freight brokers, where freight rates are typically lower, or may be forced to incur more non-revenue miles to obtain loads; and\n\uf0b7lack of access to current sources of credit or lack of lender access to capital, leading to an inability to secure financing on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nWe are also subject to cost increases outside our control that could materially reduce our profitability if we are unable to increase our rates sufficiently. Such cost increases include, but are not limited to, increases in fuel prices, driver and office employee wages, purchased transportation costs, interest rates, taxes, tolls, license and registration fees, insurance, revenue equipment and related maintenance, tires and other components and healthcare and other benefits for our employees. Further, we may not be able to appropriately adjust our costs to changing market demands. In order to maintain high variability in our business model, it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands. In periods of rapid change, it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs.\nIn addition, events outside our control, such as deterioration of U.S. transportation infrastructure and reduced investment in such infrastructure, strikes or other work stoppages at our facilities or at customer, port, border or other shipping locations, trade tariffs, actual or threatened outbreaks of disease or other public health risks, armed conflicts or terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism, military action against a foreign state or group located in a foreign state or heightened security requirements could lead to wear, tear and damage to our equipment, driver dissatisfaction, reduced economic demand and freight volumes, reduced availability of credit, increased prices for fuel or temporary closing of the shipping locations or U.S. borders. Such events or enhanced security measures in connection with such events could impair our operating efficiency and productivity and result in higher operating costs.\nChanging impacts of regulatory measures could impair our operating efficiency and productivity, decrease our revenues and profitability and result in higher operating costs. In addition, declines in the resale value of revenue equipment can affect our profitability and cash flows. From time to time, various U.S. federal, state or local taxes are also increased, including taxes on fuel. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any such tax increase applicable to us will be enacted, but such an increase could materially adversely affect our profitability.\nIncreases in driver compensation or difficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers could materially adversely affect our profitability and ability to maintain or grow our fleet.\nLike many truckload carriers, we experience substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified drivers, which includes the engagement of independent contractors. Our industry is subject to a shortage of qualified drivers. Such shortage is exacerbated during periods of economic expansion, in which alternative employment\nopportunities, including in the construction and manufacturing industries, which may offer better compensation and/or more time at home, are more plentiful and freight demand increases, or during periods of economic downturns, in which unemployment benefits might be extended and financing is limited for independent contractors who seek to purchase equipment, or the scarcity or growth of loans for students who seek financial aid for driving school. Regulatory requirements, including those related to safety ratings, ELDs and hours-of-service changes and an improved economy could further reduce the pool of eligible drivers or force us to increase driver compensation to attract and retain drivers. We have seen evidence that stricter hours-of-service regulations adopted by the DOT in the past have tightened, and, to the extent new regulations are enacted, may continue to tighten, the market for eligible drivers. The lack of adequate tractor parking along some U.S. highways and congestion caused by inadequate highway funding may make it more difficult for drivers to comply with hours-of-service regulations and cause added stress for drivers, further reducing the pool of eligible drivers. We believe that the required implementation of ELDs has and may further tighten such market. A shortage of qualified drivers and intense competition for drivers from other trucking companies will create difficulties in maintaining or increasing the number of our drivers and may restrain our ability to engage independent contractors. We have implemented driver pay increases to address this shortage and we are implementing initiatives aimed at reducing the daily friction faced by our drivers in hopes of reducing turnover. However, the compensation we offer our drivers and independent contractor expenses are subject to market conditions and our initiatives to reduce driver turnover may prove unsuccessful, therefore we may find it necessary to further increase driver compensation, change the structure of our driver compensation and/or become subject to increased independent contractor expenses in future periods, which could materially adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nIn addition, we suffer from a high turnover rate of drivers and our turnover rate is higher than the industry average and compared to our peers. This high turnover rate requires us to spend significant resources recruiting a substantial number of drivers in order to operate existing revenue equipment and subjects us to a higher degree of risk with respect to driver shortages than our competitors. Our use of team-driven tractors in our expedited service offering requires two drivers per tractor, which further increases the number of drivers we must recruit and retain in comparison to operations that require one driver per tractor. Our driver hiring standards, including hair follicle drug testing, could further reduce the pool of available drivers from which we would hire. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain a sufficient number of drivers, we could be forced to, among other things, continue to adjust our compensation packages or operate with fewer tractors and face difficulty meeting shipper demands, either of which could materially adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nOur engagement of independent contractors to provide a portion of our capacity exposes us to different risks than we face with our tractors driven by company drivers.\nOur contracts with independent contractors are governed by the federal leasing regulations, which impose specific requirements on us and the independent contractors. If more stringent federal leasing regulations are adopted, independent contractors could be deterred from becoming independent contractor drivers, which could materially adversely affect our goal of maintaining our current fleet levels of independent contractors.\nPursuant to our fuel surcharge program with independent contractors, we pay independent contractors we contract with a fuel surcharge that increases with the increase in fuel prices. A significant increase or rapid fluctuation in fuel prices could cause our costs under this program to be higher than the revenue we receive under our customer fuel surcharge programs.\nWe provide financing to certain qualified independent contractors. If we are unable to provide such financing in the future, due to liquidity constraints or other restrictions, we may experience a decrease in the number of independent contractors we are able to engage. Further, if independent contractors we engage default under or otherwise terminate the financing arrangement and we are unable to find a replacement independent contractor or seat the tractor with a company driver, we may incur losses on amounts owed to us with respect to the tractor.\nIndependent contractors are third-party service providers, as compared with company drivers, who are employed by us. As independent business owners, they may make business or personal decisions that may conflict with our best interests. For example, if a load is unprofitable, route distance is too far from home, personal scheduling conflicts arise, or for other reasons, independent contractors may deny loads of freight from time to time. In these circumstances, we must be able to deliver the freight timely in order to maintain relationships with customers, and if we fail to meet certain customer needs or incur increased expenses to do so, this could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, the autonomy of our independent contractors may frustrate any attempts to further utilize the capacity provided by independent contractors.\nIf the independent contractors we contract with are deemed by regulators or judicial process to be employees, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nTax and other regulatory authorities, as well as independent contractors themselves, have increasingly asserted that independent contractor drivers in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors, and our classification of independent contractors has been the subject of audits by such authorities from time to time. Federal legislation has been introduced in the past that would make it easier for tax and other authorities to reclassify independent contractors as employees, including legislation to increase the recordkeeping requirements for those that engage independent contractor drivers and to increase the penalties for companies who misclassify their employees and are found to have violated employees\u2019 overtime and/or wage requirements. Additionally, federal legislators have sought to abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers meeting certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a long-standing, recognized practice, to extend the Fair Labor Standards Act to independent contractors and to impose notice requirements based on employment or independent contractor status and fines for failure to comply. Some states have put initiatives in place to increase their revenue from items such as unemployment, workers\u2019 compensation and income taxes, and a reclassification of independent contractors as employees would help states with this initiative. Recently, courts in certain states have issued decisions that could result in a greater likelihood that independent contractors would be judicially classified as employees in such states. In September 2019, California enacted a law that made it more difficult for workers to be classified as independent contractors (as opposed to employees). For further discussion of this new California law, please see \"Regulation\" under \u201cItem 1. Business.\u201d Further, class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against certain members of our industry seeking to reclassify independent contractors as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers\u2019 compensation and health care coverage. In addition, companies that use lease-purchase independent contractor programs, such as us, have been more susceptible to reclassification lawsuits, and several recent decisions have been made in favor of those seeking to classify independent contractor truck drivers as employees. Taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determination of independent contractor status. If the independent contractors with whom we contract are determined to be employees, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have a history of net losses.\nWe have generated a profit in two of the last five years. Improving profitability depends upon numerous factors, including our ability to successfully execute both our ongoing and planned strategic initiatives, such as increasing our fleet efficiency and utilization, decreasing driver turnover and further refinement of our business mix profile. We may not be able to improve profitability in the future. If we are unable to improve our profitability, our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be successful in achieving our business strategies.\nMany of our business strategies require time, significant management and financial resources and successful implementation. Consequently, we may be unable to effectively and successfully implement our business strategies. We also cannot ensure that our operating results, including our operating margins, will not be materially adversely affected by future changes in and expansion of our business, including the expected expansion of our dedicated contract service and brokerage service offerings and our increased focus on the implementation of technology to improve our execution and reduce friction, or by changes in economic conditions. Further, many of our strategic initiatives are focused on the development and deployment of technology. These new technology-driven initiatives have a high degree of risk, as they involve unproven business strategies and technologies with which we have limited or no prior experience. Because such offerings and technologies are new, they may involve unforeseen expenses and regulatory and other risks. There can be no assurance that these initiatives will generate sufficient revenue to offset any new expenses or liabilities associated with these new investments. It is also possible that technology developed or deployed by others will render our technology noncompetitive or obsolete. Further, our development and deployment efforts with respect to new technologies could distract management from current operations, and will divert capital and other resources from our historical operations. Despite the implementation of our operational and tactical strategies and initiatives, we may be unsuccessful in achieving a reduction in our operating ratio in the time frames we expect or at all. Further, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected by a failure to further penetrate our existing customer base, cross-sell our services, secure new customer\nopportunities and manage the operations and expenses of new or growing services. There is no assurance that we will be successful in achieving any of our business strategies. Even if we are successful in executing our business strategies, we still may not achieve our goals.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry, and numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to improve our profitability and materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nNumerous competitive factors could impair our ability to improve our profitability and materially adversely affect our results of operations, including:\n\uf0b7we compete with many other truckload carriers of varying sizes and service offerings (including intermodal) and, to a lesser extent, with (i) less-than-truckload carriers, (ii) railroads and (iii) other transportation and brokerage companies, several of which have access to more equipment and greater capital resources than we do;\n\uf0b7many of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth in the economy, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or to maintain or expand our business or may require us to reduce our freight rates in order to maintain business and keep our equipment productive;\n\uf0b7we may increase the size of our fleet during periods of high freight demand during which our competitors also increase their capacity, and we may experience losses in greater amounts than such competitors during subsequent cycles of softened freight demand if we are required to dispose of assets at a loss to match reduced freight demand;\n\uf0b7we may have difficulty recruiting and retaining drivers because our competitors offer better compensation or working conditions;\n\uf0b7some of our larger customers are other transportation companies and/or also operate their own private trucking fleets, and they may decide to transport more of their own freight;\n\uf0b7some shippers have reduced or may reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting preferred carriers as approved service providers or by engaging dedicated providers, and we may not be selected;\n\uf0b7many customers periodically solicit bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs and this process may depress freight rates or result in a loss of business to competitors;\n\uf0b7consolidation in the trucking industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages, and we may have difficulty competing with them;\n\uf0b7advances in technology may require us to increase investments in order to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to accept higher freight rates to cover the cost of these investments;\n\uf0b7our competitors may have better safety records than us or a perception of better safety records;\n\uf0b7higher fuel prices and, in turn, higher fuel surcharges to our customers may cause some of our customers to consider freight transportation alternatives, including rail transportation;\n\uf0b7the U.S. Xpress brand name is a valuable asset that is subject to the risk of adverse publicity (whether or not justified), which could result in the loss of value attributable to our brand and reduced demand for our services;\n\uf0b7competition from freight brokerage companies may materially adversely affect our customer relationships and freight rates;\n\uf0b7new digital entrants with cheaper sources of capital could inhibit our ability to compete,\n\uf0b7our competitors may have better technology that may lead to increased operating efficiencies, reduced costs, a better ability to recruit drivers and more demand for their services, and\n\uf0b7economies of scale that procurement aggregation providers may pass on to smaller carriers may improve such carriers\u2019 ability to compete with us.\nWe retain high deductibles on a significant portion of our claims exposure, which could significantly increase the volatility of, and decrease the amount of, our earnings and materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe retain high deductibles on a significant portion of our claims exposure and related expenses associated with third-party bodily injury and property damage, employee medical expenses, workers\u2019 compensation, physical damage to our equipment and cargo loss. We currently retain a deductible of approximately $3.0 million per occurrence for automobile bodily injury and property damage through our captive risk retention group and up to $500,000 per occurrence for workers\u2019 compensation claims, both of which can make our insurance and claims expense higher or more volatile than if we maintained lower retentions. Effective September 1, 2018, we have a $3.0 million retention and an aggregate limit of $14.0 million in our $3.0 to $10.0 million layer of excess insurance coverage for automobile bodily injury and property damage. Additionally, with respect to our third-party insurance, reduced capacity in the insurance market for trucking risks can make it more difficult to obtain both primary and excess insurance, can necessitate procuring insurance offshore, and could result in increases in collateral requirements on those primary lines that require securitization.\nWe have liability coverage limits of $300.0 million per occurrence. If any claim were to exceed coverage limits, we would bear the excess in addition to our other retained amounts. Our insurance and claims expense could increase, or we could find it necessary to raise our retained amounts or decrease our coverage limits when our policies are renewed or replaced. Our initiatives aimed at reducing insurance premiums and claims expense, such as installation of forward-facing event recorders, hair follicle drug testing, and additional driver training, could prove unsuccessful. In addition, although we endeavor to limit our exposure arising with respect to such claims, we also may have exposure if carriers hired by our Brokerage segment are inadequately insured for any accident. Our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if (i) these expenses increase, (ii) we are unable to find excess coverage in amounts we deem sufficient, (iii) we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, (iv) we experience a claim for which we do not have coverage or for which our insurance carriers fail to pay or (v) we experience increased accidents. We have in the past, and may in the future, incur significant expenses for deductibles and retentions due to our accident experience.\nIf we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because claims prove to be more severe than our recorded liabilities, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe accrue the costs of the uninsured portion of pending claims based on estimates derived from our evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and an estimate of future claims development based upon historical claims development trends. Actual settlement of our retained claim liabilities could differ from our estimates due to a number of uncertainties, including evaluation of severity, legal costs and claims that have been incurred but not reported. Due to our high retained amounts, we have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims. If we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because our estimates are revised or the claims ultimately prove to be more severe than originally assessed, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nInsuring risk through our captive insurance companies could materially adversely affect our operations.\nWe utilize two captive insurers to transfer or fund risks. Mountain Lake Risk Retention Group, Inc. (\u201cMountain Lake RRG\u201d) is a state-regulated, captive risk retention group owned by two of our operating subsidiaries, U.S. Xpress, Inc. and Total Transportation of Mississippi LLC (\u201cTotal\u201d). Mountain Lake RRG writes the primary auto insurance liability policies for U.S. Xpress, Inc. and Total; a portion of this risk is transferred to Mountain Lake RRG and the remaining risk is retained as a deductible by the insured subsidiaries. Through our second captive insurer, Xpress Assurance, we participate as a reinsurer in certain third party risks related to various types of insurance policies sold to drivers who carry passengers in tractors and independent contractors engaged by U.S. Xpress, Inc. and Total. The use of the captives necessarily involves retaining certain risks that might otherwise be covered by traditional insurance products, and increases in the number or severity of claims that Mountain Lake RRG and Xpress Assurance insure have in the past, and could in the future, materially adversely affect our earnings, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreases in collateral requirements that support our insurance program and could materially adversely affect our operations.\nTo comply with certain state insurance regulatory requirements, cash and/or cash equivalents must be paid to certain of our third-party insurers, to state regulators and to our captive insurance companies and restricted as collateral to ensure payment for anticipated losses. Significant future increases in the amount of collateral required by third-party insurance carriers and regulators would reduce our liquidity and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and capital resources.\nOur captive insurance companies are subject to substantial government regulation.\nOur captive insurance companies are regulated by state authorities. State regulations generally provide protection to policy holders, rather than stockholders, and generally involve:\n\uf0b7approval of premium rates for insurance;\n\uf0b7standards of solvency;\n\uf0b7minimum amounts of statutory capital surplus that must be maintained;\n\uf0b7limitations on types and amounts of investments;\n\uf0b7regulation of dividend payments and other transactions between affiliates;\n\uf0b7regulation of reinsurance;\n\uf0b7regulation of underwriting and marketing practices;\n\uf0b7approval of policy forms;\n\uf0b7methods of accounting; and\n\uf0b7filing of annual and other reports with respect to financial condition and other matters.\nThese regulations may increase our costs, limit our ability to change premiums, restrict our ability to access cash held by these subsidiaries and otherwise impede our ability to take actions we deem advisable.\nIncreased prices for new revenue equipment, design changes of new engines, future use of autonomous tractors, volatility in the used equipment market, decreased availability of new revenue equipment and the failure of manufacturers to meet their obligations to us could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and profitability.\nWe are subject to risk with respect to higher prices for new tractors. We have experienced an increase in prices for new tractors over the past few years, and the resale value of the tractors has not increased to the same extent. Prices have increased and may continue to increase, due, in part, to (i) government regulations applicable to newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines , (ii) increases in commodity prices and (iii) and due to the pricing discretion of equipment manufacturers in periods of high demand. More restrictive EPA and state emissions standards have required vendors to introduce new engines. Compliance with such regulations has increased the cost of our new tractors and could impair equipment productivity, result in lower fuel mileage and increase our operating expenses. These adverse effects, combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the vehicles equipped with the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values realized from the disposition of these vehicles, could increase our costs or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations as the regulations become effective. Furthermore, future use of autonomous tractors could increase the price of new tractors and decrease the value of used non-autonomous tractors.\nA depressed market for used equipment could require us to trade our revenue equipment at depressed values or to record losses on disposal or impairments of the carrying values of our revenue equipment that is not protected by residual value\narrangements. Used equipment prices are subject to substantial fluctuations based on freight demand, supply of used tractors, availability of financing, the presence of buyers for export to foreign countries and commodity prices for scrap metal. If there is a deterioration of resale prices, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Trades at depressed values, decreases in proceeds under equipment disposals and impairments of the carrying values of our revenue equipment could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTractor and trailer vendors may reduce their manufacturing output in response to lower demand for their products in economic downturns or shortages of component parts. A decrease in vendor output may materially adversely affect our ability to purchase a quantity of new revenue equipment that is sufficient to sustain our desired growth rate and to maintain a late-model fleet. Moreover, an inability to obtain an adequate supply of new tractors or trailers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our revenue equipment financing arrangements have balloon payments at the end of the finance terms equal to the values we expect to be able to obtain in the used market. To the extent the used market values are lower than such balloon payments, we may be forced to sell the equipment at a loss and our results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nOur profitability may be materially adversely impacted if our capital investments do not match customer demand for invested resources or if there is a decline in the availability of funding sources for these investments.\nThe truckload industry generally, and our truckload offering in particular, is capital intensive and asset heavy, and our policy of maintaining a young, technology-equipped fleet requires us to expend significant amounts in capital expenditures annually. The amount and timing of such capital expenditures depend on various factors, including anticipated freight demand and the price and availability of assets. If anticipated demand differs materially from actual usage, our capital-intensive Truckload segment may have too many or too few assets. Moreover, resource requirements vary based on customer demand, which may be subject to seasonal or general economic conditions. During periods of decreased customer demand, our asset utilization may suffer, and we may be forced to sell equipment on the open market or turn in equipment under certain equipment leases in order to right size our fleet. This could cause us to incur losses on such sales or require payments in connection with equipment we turn in, particularly during times of a softer used equipment market, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Our ability to select profitable freight and adapt to changes in customer transportation requirements is important to efficiently deploy resources and make capital investments in tractors and trailers (with respect to our Truckload segment) or obtain qualified third-party carriers at a reasonable price (with respect to our Brokerage segment).\nWe expect to pay for projected capital expenditures with cash flows from operations, proceeds from equity sales or financing available under our existing debt instruments. Although our business volume is not highly concentrated, our customers\u2019 financial failures or loss of customer business may materially adversely affect us. If we were unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, we would need to seek alternative sources of capital, including financing, to meet our capital requirements. In the event that we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or obtain financing on favorable terms in the future, we may have to limit our fleet size, enter into less favorable financing arrangements or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability.\nUpgrading our tractors to reduce the average age of our fleet may not increase our profitability or result in cost savings as expected or at all.\nUpgrades of our tractor fleet may not result in an increase in profitability or cost savings. Expected improvements in operating ratio may lag behind new tractor deliveries, primarily because in executing a tractor fleet upgrade, we may experience costs associated with preparing our old tractors for trade, and our new tractors for integration into our fleet, and lost driving time while swapping revenue equipment. Further, tractor prices have increased and may continue to increase, due in part to government regulations applicable to newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines.\nIn addition, we cannot be certain that an agreement will be reached on price, equipment trade-ins or other terms that we deem favorable. If we do enter an agreement for the purchase of new tractors, we could be exposed to the risk that the new tractor deliveries will be delayed. Accordingly, we are subject to an increased risk that upgrades of our tractor fleet will not result in the operational results, cost savings and increases in profitability that we expect.\nDifficulty in obtaining materials, equipment, goods and services from our vendors and suppliers could adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent upon our suppliers for certain products and materials, including our tractors, trailers and chassis. We manage our OTR fleet to an approximate 475,000 mile trade cycle with an average tractor age of approximately 1.7 years as of December 31, 2019. Accordingly, we rely on suppliers of our tractors, trailers and components to maintain the age of our fleet. If we fail to maintain favorable relationships with our vendors and suppliers, or if our vendors and suppliers are unable to provide the products and materials we need or undergo financial hardship, we could experience difficulty in obtaining needed goods and services because of production interruptions, limited material availability or other reasons, or we may not be able to obtain favorable pricing or other terms. As a result, our business and operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on systems, networks and other information technology assets (and the data contained therein) and a failure in the foregoing, including those caused by cybersecurity breaches, could cause a significant disruption to our business and we may incur increasing costs in efforts to minimize those risks and comply with regulatory standards.\nOur business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our systems, networks and other information technology assets (and the data contained therein). This includes information and electronic data interchange systems that we have developed, both by creating these systems in-house or by adapting purchased or off-the-shelf applications to suit our needs. Our information and electronic data interchange systems are used for receiving and planning loads, dispatching drivers and other capacity providers, billing customers and load tracking and storing the data related to the foregoing activities. We also maintain information security policies to protect our systems, networks and other information technology assets (and the data contained therein) from cybersecurity breaches and threats, such as hackers, malware and viruses; however, such policies cannot ensure the protection of our systems, networks and other information technology assets (and the data contained therein). We currently maintain our hardware systems and infrastructure at our Chattanooga, Tennessee headquarters, along with an off-site secondary data center and computer equipment at each of our truckload service centers. If we are unable to prevent system violations or other unauthorized access to our systems, networks and other information technology assets (and the data contained therein), we could be subject to significant fines and lawsuits and our reputation could be damaged, or our business operations could be interrupted, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and business operations. Furthermore, recently enacted data privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act that became effective on January 1, 2020 and provides new data privacy rights for consumers and operational requirements for companies, may result in increased liability and amplified compliance and monitoring costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and business operations.\nOur operations, and those of our technology and communications service providers are vulnerable to interruption by fire, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failure, network disruptions, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, Internet failures, malicious intrusions, computer viruses and other events that may be beyond our control. Although we attempt to reduce the risk of disruption to our business operations through redundant computer systems and networks, backup systems and a disaster recovery off-site alternate location, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective. Furthermore, many of our strategic initiatives would require further integration of technology into our operations, which could exacerbate the effects of any such interruption. If any of our critical information technology assets fail or become otherwise unavailable, whether as a result of a cybersecurity breach, upgrade project or otherwise, we would have to perform certain functions manually, which could temporarily impact our ability to manage our fleet efficiently, respond to customers\u2019 requests effectively, maintain billing and other records reliably, and bill for services and prepare financial statements accurately or in a timely manner. Although we maintain business interruption insurance, it may be inadequate to protect us in the event of an unforeseeable and extreme catastrophe. Any significant system failure, upgrade complication, security breach or other system disruption could interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation, cause us to lose customers or impact our ability to manage our operations and report our financial performance, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are currently dependent on a single vendor platform to support certain information technology functions. If the stability or capability of such vendor is compromised and we were forced to migrate to a new platform, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur existing and future indebtedness could limit our flexibility in operating our business or adversely affect our business and our liquidity position.\nWe have significant amounts of indebtedness outstanding, including obligations under a new credit facility we entered into in January 2020 that is structured as a $250.0 million revolving credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d), equipment installment notes, finance leases and secured notes. As of December 31, 2019, we had indebtedness of $396.0 million. While our goal is to reduce our leverage, our indebtedness may increase from time to time in the future for various reasons, including fluctuations in results of operations, capital expenditures and potential acquisitions. Any indebtedness we incur and restrictive covenants contained in financing agreements governing such indebtedness could:\n\uf0b7make it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations, including making interest payments on our debt obligations;\n\uf0b7limit our ability to obtain additional financing to operate our business;\n\uf0b7require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our debt, reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund capital expenditures and working capital and other general operational requirements;\n\uf0b7expose us to the risk of increased interest rates relating to any of our indebtedness at variable rates;\n\uf0b7limit our flexibility to plan for and react to changes in our business and/or changing market conditions;\n\uf0b7place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to some of our competitors that have less, or less restrictive, debt than us;\n\uf0b7limit our ability to pursue acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures; and\n\uf0b7increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates or a downturn in our business or the economy.\nThe occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or cause a significant decrease in our liquidity and impair our ability to pay amounts due on our indebtedness. Significant repayment penalties may limit our flexibility. In addition, our Credit Facility contains usual and customary restrictive covenants for a facility of this nature including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness or issue guarantees, to create liens on our assets, to make distributions on or redeem equity interests, to make investments and to engage in mergers, consolidations, or acquisitions, and, if our excess availability is less than a specified amount, requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1:00:1:00.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate.\nIn July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021, which is expected to result in these widely used reference rates no longer being available. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are classified as either \"base rate loans\" or \"LIBOR loans.\" Borrowings under the Credit Facility are classified as either \u201cbase rate loans\u201d or \u201ceurodollar rate loans\u201d. Base rate loans accrue interest at a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%, (B) the Agent\u2019s prime rate, and (C) LIBOR plus 1.00% plus an applicable margin that is set at 0.50% through June 30, 2020 and adjusted quarterly thereafter between 0.25% and 0.75% based on the ratio of the daily average availability under the Credit Facility to the daily average of the lesser of the borrowing base or the revolving credit facility. Eurodollar rate loans accrue interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin that is set at 1.50% through June 30, 2020 and adjusted quarterly thereafter between 1.25% and 1.75% based on the ratio of the daily average availability under the Credit Facility to the daily average of the lesser of the borrowing base or the revolving credit facility. Potential changes to LIBOR, as well as uncertainty related to such potential changes and the establishment of any alternative reference rate, may adversely affect our cost of capital. At this time, we cannot predict the overall effect of the modification or discontinuation of LIBOR or the establishment of any alternative benchmark rate.\nIn the future, we may need to obtain additional financing that may not be available or, if it is available, may result in a reduction in the percentage ownership of our then-existing stockholders.\nWe may need to raise additional funds in order to:\n\uf0b7finance unanticipated working capital requirements, capital investments or refinance existing indebtedness;\n\uf0b7develop or enhance our technological infrastructure and our existing products and services;\n\uf0b7fund strategic relationships;\n\uf0b7respond to competitive pressures; and\n\uf0b7acquire complementary businesses, technologies, products or services.\nIf the economy and/or the credit markets weaken, or we are unable to enter into capital or operating leases to acquire revenue equipment on terms favorable to us, our business, financial results and results of operations could be materially adversely affected, especially if consumer confidence declines and domestic spending decreases. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our strategic initiatives, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance technology or services or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our then-existing stockholders may be reduced, and holders of these securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our then-existing stockholders.\nWe are exposed to the credit, reputational and relationship risks of certain of our current and former equity investments.\nCertain of our current and former equity investments, including Parker Global Enterprises, Inc. (\u201cParker\u201d), XPS Logisti-K Systems, S.A.P.I. de C.V. (\u201cLogisti-K\u201d), Dylka Distribuciones Logisti-K S.A. de C.V. (\u201cDylka\u201d) and Xpress Internacional, have amounts owing to us. Furthermore, we may have overlapping customers and vendors with Parker, Logisti-K, Dylka and Xpress Internacional. Any financial hardships of Parker, Logisti-K, Dylka, or Xpress Internacional could lead to delay or nonpayment of amounts owed to us, strain our relationships with overlapping customers and vendors, and damage our reputation. The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such risks may be heightened during a weak freight environment.\nFluctuations in the price or availability of fuel or surcharge collection may increase our costs of operation, which could materially adversely affect our profitability.\nFuel is one of our largest operating expenses. Diesel fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to factors beyond our control, such as political events, terrorist activities, armed conflicts, commodity futures trading, depreciation of the dollar against other currencies, weather events and other natural or man-made disasters, each of which may lead to an increase in the cost of fuel. Fuel prices also are affected by the rising demand for fuel in developing countries, including China, and could be materially adversely affected by the use of crude oil and oil reserves for purposes other than fuel production and by diminished drilling activity. Such events may lead not only to increases in fuel prices, but also to fuel shortages and disruptions in the fuel supply chain. Because our operations are dependent upon diesel fuel, significant diesel fuel cost increases, shortages, rationings, or supply disruptions would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuel also is subject to regional pricing differences and is often more expensive on the West Coast of the United States, where we have operations. Increases in fuel costs, to the extent not offset by rate per mile increases or fuel surcharges, have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability. While we have fuel surcharge programs in place with a majority of our customers, which historically have helped us offset the majority of the negative impact of rising fuel prices associated with loaded or billed miles, we also incur fuel costs that cannot be recovered even with respect to customers with which we maintain fuel surcharge programs, such as those associated with non-revenue generating miles, the time when our engines are idling and fuel for refrigeration units on our refrigerated trailers. Moreover, the terms of each customer\u2019s fuel surcharge program vary, and certain customers have sought to modify the terms of their fuel surcharge programs to minimize recoverability for fuel price increases. In addition, because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices, our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture the increased costs we pay for fuel, especially when\nprices are rising. This could lead to fluctuations in our levels of reimbursement, which have occurred in the past. During periods of low freight volumes, shippers can use their negotiating leverage to impose fuel surcharge policies that provide a lower reimbursement of our fuel costs. There is no assurance that our fuel surcharge program can be maintained indefinitely or will be sufficiently effective. Our results of operations would be negatively affected to the extent we cannot recover higher fuel costs or fail to improve our fuel price protection through our fuel surcharge program.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry, and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with, or liability for violations of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have authority to operate in the United States, as granted by the DOT, Mexico (as granted by the Secretar\u00eda de Comunicaciones y Transportes), and various Canadian provinces (as granted by the Ministries of Transportation and Communication in such provinces). In the United States, we are also regulated by the EPA, the DHS and other agencies in states in which we operate. Our company drivers, independent contractors and third-party carriers also must comply with the applicable safety and fitness regulations of the DOT, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing, driver safety performance and hours-of-service. Matters such as weight, equipment dimensions, exhaust emissions, fuel efficiency and hazardous material transportation, storage and disposal are also subject to government regulations. We also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel efficiency, exhaust emissions, hours-of-service, drug and alcohol testing, ergonomics, on-board reporting of operations, collective bargaining, security at ports, speed limiters, driver training and other matters affecting safety or operating methods. Future laws and regulations may be more stringent, require changes in our operating practices, influence the demand for transportation services or require us to incur significant additional costs. Higher costs incurred by us, or by our suppliers who pass the costs onto us through higher supplies and materials pricing, or liabilities we may incur related to our failure to comply with existing or future regulations could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the Trump administration has indicated a desire to reduce regulatory burdens that constrain growth and productivity and also to introduce legislation such as infrastructure spending that could improve our growth and productivity, to the extent implemented.\nIn January 2016, the FMCSA proposed changes to the DOT\u2019s safety rating system, which would determine unfit carriers on a monthly basis using roadside inspection data in addition to investigations and onsite reviews. This change was expected to significantly increase the number of carriers deemed unfit and potentially unable to continue to operate. In March 2017, in response to significant objection by the industry, the FMCSA withdrew the proposed changes but noted that new rulemaking related to a similar process may be initiated in the future. Therefore, it is uncertain if, when or under what form any such new rule could be implemented. New rulemaking related to the DOT\u2019s safety rating system or changes to the CSA program that impacts our safety rating or CSA scores could materially adversely affect our results of operations. The FMCSA also recently announced plans to conduct a new study on the causation of certain crashes. Although it remains unclear whether such a study will ultimately be undertaken and completed, the results of such a study could spur further proposed and/or final rules regarding safety and fitness in the U.S.\nIn December 2016, the FMCSA issued a final rule establishing a national clearinghouse for drug and alcohol testing results and requiring motor carriers and medical review officers to provide records of violations by commercial drivers of FMCSA drug and alcohol testing requirements. Motor carriers will be required to query the clearinghouse to ensure drivers and driver applicants do not have violations of federal drug and alcohol testing regulations that prohibit them from operating commercial motor vehicles. The final rule became effective on January 4, 2017, with a compliance date of January 6, 2020. In December 2019, however, the FMCSA announced a final rule extending by three years the date for state driver\u2019s licensing agencies to comply with certain Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse requirements. The December 2016 commercial driver\u2019s license rule required states to request information from the Clearinghouse about individuals prior to issuing, renewing, upgrading or transferring a CDL. This new action will allow states\u2019 compliance with the requirement, which was set to begin January 2020, to be delayed until January 2023.\nIn addition, other rules have been recently proposed or made final by the FMCSA, including (i) a rule requiring the use of speed limiting devices on heavy duty tractors to restrict maximum speeds, which was proposed in 2016 and (ii) a rule setting forth minimum driver-training standards for new drivers applying for commercial driver\u2019s licenses for the first time and to experienced drivers upgrading their licenses or seeking a hazardous materials endorsement, which was made final in December 2016 with a compliance date in February 2020 (FMCSA officials have recently reported, however, that they are delaying implementation of the final rule by two years). In July 2017, the DOT announced that it would no longer pursue a speed limiter rule, but left open the possibility that it could resume such a pursuit in the future. In 2019, U.S.\nCongressional representatives proposed a similar rule related to speed-limiting devices. The effect of these rules, to the extent they become effective, could result in a decrease in fleet production and/or driver availability, either of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nU.S. Congressional representatives also proposed a bill in 2019 that would pave the way for commercial drivers younger than 21 to drive tractors across state lines. This new bill, which would lower the age requirement of 21 to 18 for interstate commercial driving if certain requirements are met, received support from the ATA during a February 2020 Senate hearing. It is unclear how long the process of finalizing such a bill will take, however, if one comes to fruition at all.\nIn March 2014, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the application of California state wage and hour laws to interstate truck drivers is not pre-empted by U.S. federal law. The case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which denied certiorari in May 2015, and accordingly, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision stands. However, in December 2018, the FMCSA granted a petition filed by the American Trucking Associations and in doing so determined that federal law does pre-empt California\u2019s wage and hour laws, and interstate truck drivers are not subject to such laws. The FMCSA\u2019s decision has been appealed by labor groups and multiple lawsuits have been filed in U.S. federal courts seeking to overturn the decision, and thus it\u2019s uncertain whether it will stand. Current and future U.S. state and local wage and hour laws, including laws related to employee meal breaks and rest periods, may vary significantly from U.S. federal law. Further, driver piece rate compensation, which is an industry standard, has been attacked as non-compliant with state minimum wage laws. Both of these issues are adversely impacting the Corporation and the industry as a whole, with respect to the practical application of the laws, thereby resulting in additional cost. As a result, we, along with other companies in our industry, are subject to an uneven patchwork of wage and hour laws throughout the United States. Legislation to preempt state and local wage and hour laws has been proposed in the past; however, passage of such legislation is uncertain. If federal legislation is not passed, we will either need to comply with the most restrictive state and local laws across our entire fleet, or revise our management systems to comply with varying state and local laws. Either solution could result in increased compliance and labor costs, driver turnover, decreased efficiency, and amplified legal exposure, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations\nThe NHTSA, the EPA and certain states, including California, have adopted regulations that are aimed at reducing tractor emissions and/or increasing fuel economy of the equipment we use. Certain of these regulations are currently effective, with stricter emission and fuel economy standards becoming effective over the next several years. Other regulations have been proposed that would similarly increase these standards. The effects of these regulations have been and may continue to be increases in new tractor and trailer prices, additional parts and maintenance costs, impaired productivity and uncertainty as to the reliability of the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values of our equipment. Such effects could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in existing regulations and implementation of new regulations, such as those related to trailer size limits, emissions and fuel economy, hours-of-service, mandating ELDs and drug and alcohol testing in Canada, the United States and Mexico, could increase capacity in the industry or improve the position of certain competitors, either of which could negatively impact pricing and volumes or require additional investments by us. The short and long term impacts of changes in legislation or regulations are difficult to predict and could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nSafety-related evaluations and rankings under CSA could materially adversely affect our profitability and operations, our ability to maintain or grow our fleet and our customer relationships.\nUnder the CSA program, fleets are evaluated and ranked against their peers based on certain safety-related standards. Carriers are grouped by category with other carriers that have a similar number of safety events (i.e. crashes, inspections, or violations) and carriers are ranked and assigned a rating percentile or score to prioritize them for interventions if they are above a certain threshold. As a result, our fleet could be ranked poorly as compared to peer carriers, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We recruit and retain first-time drivers to be part of our fleet, and these drivers may have a higher likelihood of creating adverse safety events under CSA. The occurrence of future deficiencies could affect driver recruitment by causing high-quality drivers to seek employment with other carriers or limit the pool of available drivers or could cause our customers to direct their business away from us and to carriers with higher fleet safety rankings, either of which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, future deficiencies could increase our insurance expenses. Additionally, competition for drivers with favorable safety backgrounds may increase, which could necessitate increases in driver-related compensation costs. Further, we may incur greater than expected expenses in our attempts to improve unfavorable scores.\nSince our driver turnover is higher than the industry average, any events that decrease the pool of available drivers or increase the competition for drivers may have a disproportionately negative impact on us versus our competitors.\nCertain of our subsidiaries are currently exceeding the established intervention thresholds in one or more of the seven CSA safety-related categories. Based on these unfavorable ratings, we may be prioritized for an intervention action or roadside inspection, either of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, customers may be less likely to assign loads to us. While we have put procedures in place in an attempt to address areas where we are exceeding and have in the past exceeded the thresholds, we cannot assure you these measures will be effective.\nIn December 2015, Congress passed the FAST Act, which calls for significant CSA reform. The FAST Act directs the FMCSA to conduct studies of the scoring system used to generate CSA rankings to determine if it is effective in identifying high-risk carriers and predicting future crash risk. This study was conducted and delivered to the FMCSA in June 2017 with several recommendations to make the CSA program more fair, accurate and reliable. In late June 2018, the FMCSA provided a report to Congress outlining the changes it may make to the CSA program in response to the study. Such changes include the testing and possible adoption of a revised risk modeling theory, potential collection and dissemination of additional carrier data and revised measures for intervention thresholds. The adoption of such changes is contingent on the results of the new modeling theory and additional public feedback. Thus, it is unclear if, when and to what extent such changes to the CSA program will occur. Additionally, with the FAST Act set to expire in September 2020, the U.S. Congress has noted its intent to consider a multiyear highway measure that would update the FAST Act, which could lead to further changes to the CSA program. Any changes that increase the likelihood of us receiving unfavorable scores could materially adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.\nReceipt of an unfavorable DOT safety rating could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nWe currently have a satisfactory DOT rating for our U.S. operations, which is the highest available rating under the current safety rating scale. If we were to receive a conditional or unsatisfactory DOT safety rating, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations as customer contracts may require a satisfactory DOT safety rating, and a conditional or unsatisfactory rating could materially adversely affect or restrict our operations.\nThe FMCSA has proposed regulations that would modify the existing rating system and the safety labels assigned to motor carriers evaluated by the DOT. Under regulations that were proposed in 2016, the methodology for determining a carrier\u2019s DOT safety rating would be expanded to include the on-road safety performance of the carrier\u2019s drivers and equipment, as well as results obtained from investigations. Exceeding certain thresholds based on such performance or results would cause a carrier to receive an unfit safety rating. The proposed regulations were withdrawn in March 2017, but the FMCSA noted that a similar process may be initiated in the future. If similar regulations were enacted and we were to receive an unfit or other negative safety rating, our business would be materially adversely affected in the same manner as if we received a conditional or unsatisfactory safety rating under the current regulations. In addition, poor safety performance could lead to increased risk of liability, increased insurance, maintenance and equipment costs and potential loss of customers, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, applicants, independent contractor drivers, customers, vendors, government agencies, stockholders and other parties through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions and other processes. Recently, we and several other trucking companies have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging violations of various federal and state wage and hour laws regarding, among other things, minimum wage, meal and rest periods, overtime eligibility and failure to pay for all hours worked. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial settlements or damages by other carriers.\nThe outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, such as our pending wage and hour class action lawsuit, the independent contractor putative class action lawsuit and the putative class action lawsuits arising out of our IPO, and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceeding.\u201d Additionally, the cost to defend litigation may also be significant. Not all claims are covered by our insurance (including wage and hour claims), and there can be no assurance that our coverage limits will be adequate to cover all amounts in dispute. To the extent we experience claims that are uninsured, exceed our coverage limits, involve significant aggregate use of our retention amounts, or cause\nincreases in future premiums, the resulting expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we may be subject, and have been subject in the past, to litigation resulting from trucking accidents. The number and severity of litigation claims may be worsened by distracted driving by both truck drivers and other motorists. These lawsuits have resulted, and may result in the future, in the payment of substantial settlements or damages and increases of our insurance costs.\nWe are a defendant in putative class action lawsuits and a stockholder derivative lawsuit arising out of our IPO and we may be involved in additional litigation in the future. Such lawsuits could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention.\nIn 2018, a putative class action lawsuit alleging violations of federal securities laws was filed naming us and certain of our officers and directors as defendants. Plaintiffs also named as defendants the underwriters in our IPO. Since then, several other actions making substantially the same allegations have been filed. The plaintiffs in these lawsuits generally allege that our registration statement and prospectus related to our IPO contained materially false or misleading statements. Additionally, one of these lawsuits alleges that the Company, its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer made false and/or misleading statements and/or material omissions in press releases, earnings calls, investor conferences, television interviews, and filings made with the SEC subsequent to our IPO. Furthermore, a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed against five of our executives and our independent board members (the \u201cIndividual Defendants\u201d), naming the Company as a nominal defendant. The complaint alleges that the Company made false and/or misleading statements in the registration statement and prospectus filed with the SEC in connection with our IPO and that the Individual Defendants breached their fiduciary duties by causing or allowing the Company to make such statements. The complaint alleges that the Company has been damaged by the alleged wrongful conduct as a result of, among other things, being subjected to the time and expense of the securities class action lawsuits that have been filed relating to our IPO. In addition to a claim for alleged breach of fiduciary duties, the lawsuit alleges claims against the Individual Defendants for unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets.\nThese lawsuits may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. Although we deny the material allegations in the lawsuits and intend to defend ourselves vigorously, defending the lawsuits could result in substantial costs. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. In addition, we may be the target of securities-related litigation in the future, both related and unrelated to the existing class action lawsuits. Such litigation could divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, result in substantial damages, costs and expense and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are generally obligated to indemnify our current and former directors and officers in connection with lawsuits and related litigation or settlement amounts. We maintain director and officer insurance to protect us from such lawsuits, however, we are responsible for meeting certain deductibles under the policies. In addition, we cannot assure you that such policies will adequately protect us from lawsuits or that costs and expenses related to lawsuits will not exceed the coverage provided under such policies. Further, as a result of the pending lawsuits, the costs of director and officer insurance may increase and the availability of coverage may decrease. As a result, we may not be able to maintain our current levels of director and officer insurance at a reasonable cost, or at all, which might make it more difficult to attract qualified candidates to serve as executive officers or directors. The effect of these lawsuits involving our officers and directors and the resolution of these matters may result in significant damages, costs and expenses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe evaluate these and other litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the probability of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our current assessments and estimates, and any adverse resolution of litigation pending or threatened against us could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nManagement and key employee turnover or failure to attract and retain qualified management and other key personnel, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on the leadership and expertise of our executive management team and other key personnel to design and execute our strategic and operating plans. While we have employment agreements in place with these executives, there can be no assurance we will continue to retain their services and we may become subject to significant severance payments if our relationship with these executives is terminated under certain circumstances. Further, turnover, planned or otherwise, in these or other key leadership positions may materially adversely affect our ability to manage our business efficiently and effectively, and such turnover can be disruptive and distracting to management, may lead to additional departures of existing personnel and could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future profitability. We must recruit, develop and retain a core group of managers to realize our goal of expanding our operations, improving our earnings consistency and positioning ourselves for long-term operating revenue growth.\nWe have several major customers, and the loss of, or significant reduction of business with, one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue is generated from a small number of major customers, the loss of, or significant reduction of business with, one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our top 25 customers, based on revenue, accounted for approximately 71.2% of our revenue; our top ten customers, approximately 55.3% of our revenue; our top five customers, approximately 40.4% of our revenue; and our largest customer, Walmart Inc., accounted for approximately 12.3% of our revenue, in each case, calculated excluding fuel surcharge. A substantial portion of our freight is from customers in the retail industry. As such, our volumes are largely dependent on consumer spending and retail sales, and our results may be more susceptible to trends in unemployment and retail sales than carriers that do not have this concentration. In addition, our major customers engage in bid processes and other activities periodically (including currently) in an attempt to lower their costs of transportation. We may not choose to participate in these bids or, if we participate, may not be awarded the freight, either of which circumstances could result in a reduction of our freight volumes with these customers. In this event, we could be required to replace the volumes elsewhere at uncertain rates and volumes, suffer reduced equipment utilization or reduce the size of our fleet. Failure to retain our existing customers, or enter into relationships with new customers, each on acceptable terms, could materially impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to meet our current and long-term financial forecasts.\nEconomic conditions and capital markets may materially adversely affect our customers and their ability to remain solvent. Our customers\u2019 financial difficulties can negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to comply with the covenants under our debt agreements, especially if they were to delay or default on payments to us. Generally, we do not have contractual relationships that guarantee any minimum volumes with our customers, and we cannot assure you that our customer relationships will continue as presently in effect. Our dedicated contract service offering is typically subject to longer term written contracts than our OTR service offering. However, certain of these contracts contain cancellation clauses, including our \u201cevergreen\u201d contracts, which automatically renew for one year terms but that can be terminated more easily. There is no assurance any of our customers, including our dedicated contract customers, will continue to utilize our services, renew our existing contracts, or continue at the same volume levels. Despite the existence of contractual arrangements with our customers, certain of our customers may nonetheless engage in competitive bidding processes that could negatively impact our contractual relationship. In addition, certain of our major customers may increasingly use their own truckload and delivery fleets, which would reduce our freight volumes. A reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers, including our dedicated contract customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the size and market concentration of some of our customers may allow them to exert increased pressure on the prices, margins and non-monetary terms of our contracts.\nWe depend on third-party service providers, particularly in our Brokerage segment, and service instability from these providers could increase our operating costs and reduce our ability to offer brokerage services, which could materially adversely affect our revenue, business, financial condition, results of operations and customer relationships.\nOur Brokerage segment is dependent upon the services of third-party carriers, including other truckload carriers. For this business, we do not own or control the transportation assets that deliver our customers\u2019 freight and we do not employ the providers directly involved in delivering the freight. These third-party providers may seek other freight opportunities\nand/or require increased compensation in times of improved freight demand or tight truckload capacity. If we are unable to secure the services of these third parties or if we become subject to increases in the prices we must pay to secure such services, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected, and we may be unable to serve our customers on competitive terms. Our ability to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services may be affected by many risks beyond our control, including equipment shortages in the transportation industry, particularly among contracted truckload carriers, new entrants with different business models, interruptions in service due to labor disputes, driver shortage, changes in regulations impacting transportation and changes in transportation rates.\nWe may not make acquisitions in the future, which could impede growth, or if we do, we may not be successful in integrating any acquired businesses, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nHistorically, a key component of our growth strategy has been to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses. We currently do not expect to make any material acquisitions over the next few years, which could impede growth. If we do make acquisitions, we cannot assure that we will be successful in negotiating, consummating or integrating the acquisitions. If we succeed in consummating future acquisitions, our business, financial condition and results of operations, may be materially adversely affected because:\n\uf0b7some of the acquired businesses may not achieve anticipated revenue, earnings or cash flows;\n\uf0b7we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us or otherwise exceed our estimates;\n\uf0b7we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully, or at all, and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems;\n\uf0b7acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and divert our resources;\n\uf0b7we may experience difficulties operating in markets in which we have had no or only limited direct experience;\n\u00b7\nwe may incur transactions costs and acquisition-related integration costs;\n\uf0b7we could lose customers, employees and drivers of any acquired company;\n\uf0b7we may incur additional indebtedness; and\n\uf0b7we may issue additional shares of our Class A common stock, which would dilute the ownership of our then-existing stockholders.\nWe are subject to certain risks arising from our Mexican operations.\nWe have operations in Mexico, representing approximately $2.4 million of our revenue in 2019, excluding fuel surcharge. Even following our sale of Xpress Internacional, we expect to have business to and from Mexico through a more variable cost model using third party carriers. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including fluctuations in foreign currencies, changes in the economic strength of Mexico, difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights, burdens of complying with a wide variety of international and U.S. export and import laws, economic sanctions and social, political and economic instability. We must also comply with applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials. We cannot guarantee compliance with all applicable laws, and violations could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil or criminal penalties, competitive or reputational harm, litigation or regulatory action and other consequences that might adversely affect our results of operations and our consolidated performance.\nIn addition, if we are unable to maintain our Free and Secure Trade (\u201cFAST\u201d), Business Alliance for Secure Commerce (\u201cBASC\u201d) and U.S. C-TPAT certification statuses, we may have significant border delays, which could cause our Mexican operations to be less efficient than those of competitor truckload carriers also operating in Mexico that obtain or continue to maintain FAST, BASC and C-TPAT certifications. We also face additional risks associated with our foreign operations,\nincluding restrictive trade policies and imposition of duties, taxes or government royalties imposed by the Mexican government, to the extent not preempted by the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d) or its proposed replacement, the United-States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d), which has been ratified by the U.S. and Mexico, but must be ratified by Canada in order to go into effect. In addition, changes to NAFTA, USMCA (if ratified by Canada) or other treaties governing our business could materially adversely affect our international business. It is also uncertain how the USMCA, if ratified by Canada, will impact foreign trade and our Mexican operations. Factors that substantially affect the operations of our business in Mexico may have a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations. Additionally, the management team for our Mexican operations is relatively small and each member of the management team has significant impact on the performance and results of our Mexican operations. The loss of one or more of the management members could have a negative effect on our Mexican revenue and results of operations and on our consolidated performance.\nChanges to trade regulation, quotas, duties or tariffs, caused by the changing U.S. and geopolitical environments or otherwise, may increase our costs and materially adversely affect our business.\nActions by the Trump administration have led to the imposition of tariffs on certain imported steel and aluminum. The implementation of these tariffs, as well as the imposition of additional tariffs or quotas or changes to certain trade agreements, including tariffs applied to goods traded between the United States and China, could, among other things, increase the costs of the materials used by our suppliers to produce new revenue equipment or increase the price of fuel. Such cost increases for our revenue equipment suppliers would likely be passed on to us, and to the extent fuel prices increase, we may not be able to fully recover such increases through rate increases or our fuel surcharge program, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe USMCA could also impact the amount, movement and patterns of freight we transport.\nOur business depends on our reputation and the value of the U.S. Xpress brand, and if we are unable to protect our brand name or proprietary and other intellectual property rights, our competitive position may be harmed.\nWe believe that the U.S. Xpress brand name symbolizes high-quality service and reliability and is a significant sales and marketing tool to which we devote substantial resources to promote and protect. Adverse publicity, whether or not justified, related to activities by our drivers, independent contractors or agents, such as accidents, customer service issues or noncompliance with laws, could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. With the increased use of social media outlets, adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly, making it difficult for us to respond effectively. Damage to our reputation and loss of value in our brand could reduce the demand for our services and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.\nIn addition, we depend on the protection of our proprietary and other intellectual property rights, including service marks, trademarks, domain names, patents, copyrights, confidential information and similar intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees, independent contractors, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to establish and protect these proprietary and other intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary and other intellectual property rights, third parties may use our proprietary and other intellectual property information without our authorization and may otherwise misappropriate, infringe or violate the same, and efforts to prevent or police such unauthorized use or misappropriation, including instituting litigation, may consume significant resources, which could materially adversely affect our business, distract our management and divert our resources.\nDevelopments in labor and employment law and any unionizing efforts by employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe face the risk that Congress, federal agencies or one or more states could approve legislation or regulations significantly affecting our businesses and our relationship with our employees, such as the previously proposed federal legislation referred to as the Employee Free Choice Act, which would have substantially liberalized the procedures for union organization. None of our domestic employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement, but any attempt by our employees to organize a labor union could result in increased legal and other associated costs. Additionally, given the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s \u201cspeedy election\u201d rule, our ability to timely and effectively address any unionizing efforts would be difficult. If we entered into a collective bargaining agreement with our domestic employees, the terms could materially adversely affect our costs, efficiency and ability to generate acceptable returns on the affected operations.\nAdditionally, the Department of Labor issued a final rule in 2016 raising the minimum salary basis exemption from overtime payments for executive, administrative and professional employees. The rule purported to increase the minimum salary from the current amount of $23,660 to $47,476 and aimed to count non-discretionary bonus, commission and other incentive payments towards the minimum salary requirement. The rule was scheduled to go into effect on December 1, 2016. However, the rule was temporarily enjoined from going into effect in November 2016, and later invalidated in August 2017, after several states and business groups filed separate lawsuits against the Department of Labor challenging the rule. However, on January 1, 2020, a similar final rule adopted by the Department of Labor went into effect, raising the current minimum salary level for exempt employees from $455 per week, or $23,660 annually, to $684 per week, or $35,568 annually, and allowing for up to 10 percent of the standard salary level to come from non-discretionary bonuses and incentive payments (including commissions) that are paid at least annually. This rule, and any future rule similar to this rule that impacts the way we classify certain positions, increases our payment of overtime wages or increases the salaries we are required to pay to currently exempt employees to maintain their exempt status may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThese types of cases have increased since March 2014 when the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the application of California state wage and hour laws to interstate truck drivers is not preempted by federal law. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which denied certiorari in May 2015, and accordingly, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision stood. However, in December 2018, the FMCSA granted a petition filed by the ATA and in doing so determined that federal law does preempt California\u2019s wage and hour laws, and interstate truck drivers are not subject to such laws. The FMCSA\u2019s decision has been appealed by labor groups and multiple lawsuits have been filed in federal courts seeking to overturn the decision, and thus it\u2019s uncertain whether it will stand. Other current and future state and local wage and hour laws, including laws related to employee meal breaks and rest periods, may also vary significantly from federal law. As a result, we, along with other companies in the industry, are subject to an uneven patchwork of wage and hour laws throughout the United States. In the past, certain legislators have proposed federal legislation to solidify the preemption of state and local wage and hour laws applied to interstate truck drivers; however, passage of such legislation is uncertain. If federal legislation is not passed, we may either need to comply with the most restrictive state and local laws across our entire fleet, or revise our management systems to comply with varying state and local laws. Either solution could result in increased compliance and labor costs, driver turnover and decreased efficiency.\nSeasonality and the impact of weather and other catastrophic events affect our operations and profitability.\nOur tractor productivity decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations and some shippers reduce their shipments after the winter holiday season. Revenue may also be adversely affected by inclement weather and holidays, since revenue is directly related to available working days of shippers. At the same time, operating expenses increase and fuel efficiency declines because of engine idling and harsh weather creating higher accident frequency, increased claims and higher equipment repair expenditures. We also may suffer from weather-related or other unforeseen events such as tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods, fires, earthquakes and explosions. These events may disrupt fuel supplies, increase fuel costs, disrupt freight shipments or routes, affect regional economies, damage or destroy our assets or adversely affect the business or financial condition of our customers, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or make our results of operations more volatile.\nOur total assets include goodwill and other intangibles. If we determine that these items have become impaired in the future, net income could be materially adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had recorded goodwill of $57.7 million and other intangible assets of $27.2 million primarily as a result of certain customer relationships connected with certain acquisition-related transactions and trade names. Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration paid by us over the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets acquired by us. We may never realize the full value of our goodwill or intangible assets. Any future determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUncertainties in the interpretation and application of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could materially adversely affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate.\nIn December 2017, the U.S. enacted comprehensive tax legislation, commonly referred to as the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cAct\u201d). The new law requires complex computations not previously required by U.S. tax law. As such, the application of accounting guidance for such items is currently uncertain. Further, compliance with the new law and the\naccounting for such provisions require preparation and analysis of information not previously required or regularly produced. In addition, the U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law and impact our results of operations in future periods. Accordingly, while we have provided a provisional estimate on the effect of the new law in our accompanying audited financial statements, further regulatory or U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) accounting guidance for the law, our further analysis on the application of the law, and refinement of our initial estimates and calculations could materially change our current provisional estimates, which could in turn materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. There are also likely to be significant future impacts that these tax reforms will have on our future financial results and our business strategies. In addition, there is a risk that states or foreign jurisdictions may amend their tax laws in response to these tax reforms, which could have a material adverse effect on our results.\nThe price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those described above and the following:\n\uf0b7actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual financial results;\n\uf0b7the financial guidance we may provide to the public, any changes in such guidance or our failure to meet such guidance;\n\uf0b7failure of industry or securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates or downgrades of our Class A common stock or our sector by any industry or securities analysts that follow us or our failure to meet such estimates;\n\uf0b7downgrades in our credit ratings or the credit ratings of our competitors;\n\uf0b7market factors, including rumors, whether or not correct, involving us or our competitors;\n\uf0b7unfavorable market reactions to allegations regarding the safety of our or our competitors' services and costs or negative publicity arising out of any potential litigation and/or government investigations resulting therefrom;\n\uf0b7fluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of securities of similar companies;\n\uf0b7sales or anticipated sales of large blocks of our Class A common stock;\n\uf0b7short selling of our Class A common stock by investors;\n\uf0b7limited \"public float\" in the hands of a small number of persons whose sales or lack of sales of our Class A common stock could result in positive or negative pricing pressure on the market price for our Class A common stock;\n\uf0b7our ability to satisfy our ongoing capital requirements and unanticipated cash needs or adverse market reaction to any additional indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future;\n\uf0b7additions or departures of key personnel;\n\uf0b7announcements of new commercial relationships, acquisitions or other strategic transactions, or entry into new markets or exit from markets by us or our competitors;\n\uf0b7failure of any of our initiatives, including our growth strategy, to achieve commercial success;\n\uf0b7regulatory or political developments;\n\uf0b7changes in accounting principles or methodologies;\n\uf0b7litigation or governmental investigations;\n\uf0b7negative publicity about us in the media and online; and\n\uf0b7general financial market conditions or events.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations sometimes have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In addition, certain index providers, such as FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones, have announced restrictions that limit or preclude inclusion of companies with multiple-class share structures in certain indexes. Because of our dual-class structure, we may be excluded from these indexes and we cannot assure you that other stock indexes will not take similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from stock indexes would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. These and other factors may cause the market price and demand for our Class A common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of Class A common stock and may otherwise adversely affect the price or liquidity of our Class A common stock.\nWe previously identified four material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We have concluded that we have remediated three of such material weaknesses. If our remediation of the remaining material weakness is not effective, or if we identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our Class A common stock.\nPrior to our IPO, we were not required to comply with the rules of the SEC implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and were therefore not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for that purpose. Since our IPO, we have been required to comply with the SEC's rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which has required management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of controls over financial reporting. We were required to make our first annual assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 (including an auditor attestation on management's internal controls report) in this Form 10-K.\nAs disclosed in Item 9A of this report, during the course of preparing for our IPO, we identified four material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. As of December 31, 2019, we have concluded that we had remediated material weaknesses related to (i) the design of controls over income tax accounting (ii) evidential matter supporting the design and implementation of our controls and (iii) the control activities component of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission framework. However, as of December 31, 2019, we had a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to a failure to maintain an effective control environment as a result of key information technology general controls being implemented in the quarter ending December 31, 2019, which did not allow an ample instances of control operations to determine operational effectiveness. Management believes additional time is needed to demonstrate the sustainability and effectiveness of the established controls before concluding on remediation of the material weakness. There is no assurance that we will effectively remediate the material weakness or that we will not identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future.\nIf we fail to effectively remediate the material weakness in our control environment, if we identify future material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, or if we are unable to comply with the demands that have been placed upon us as a public company, including the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, in a timely manner, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results, or report them within the timeframes required by the SEC. We also could become subject to sanctions or investigations by the NYSE, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. In addition, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, when required, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, we may face restricted access to the capital markets and our stock price may be adversely affected.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business, our market or our competitors, or if they change their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock in a negative way, the price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who cover us change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock in a negative way, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our Class A common stock would likely decline. If any analyst who covers us were to cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our Class A common stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe large number of shares eligible for public sale in the future, or the perception of the public that these sales may occur, could depress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of (i) sales of a large number of shares of our Class A common stock, particularly sales by our directors, employees (including our executive officers) and significant stockholders, and (ii) a large number of shares of our Class A common stock being registered or offered for sale (including upon the conversion of Class B shares for Class A shares and the subsequent sale by the holders thereof). These sales, or the perception that these sales could occur, may depress the market price of our Class A common stock. Any shares of Class B common stock sold to non-family members will automatically convert to Class A common stock upon such sale. In addition to the sale of existing Class A shares, our charter does not limit the conversion of shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock upon transfer by the holders thereof and as a result, all of the shares of Class B common stock may be converted into shares of Class A common stock, which could have a negative effect on the market price of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock.\nAdditionally, entities affiliated with Mr. Max Fuller have negatively pledged 8,261,776 shares of Class B common stock as security for a loan, as well as the equity of the entities holding such shares. If the lender for such loan were to foreclose on the entities holding such shares and sell such shares into the market, it could result in (i) a decrease of the market price of the outstanding share of Class A stock, (ii) an increase volatility in the market price of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock and (iii) a change in control of the Company. Our Board of Directors has approved, subject to stockholder approval, an amendment to our Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (\"Articles of Incorporation\") that would allow trusts and entities affiliated with Messrs. Max Fuller and Eric Fuller and Ms. Lisa Pate to pledge shares of Class B common stock without automatic conversion to Class A common stock, in addition to their ability to pledge shares of Class B common stock individually without automatic conversion to Class A common stock. Accordingly, subject to approval by our Board of Directors, to the extent required by our Executive and Director Stock Ownership, Retention, and Anti-Hedging and Pledging Policy, all shares of Class B common stock would be eligible for pledging.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with certain members of the Fuller and Quinn families (or trusts for the benefit of any of them or entities owned by any of them), which limits or precludes the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has five votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Stockholders who hold shares of Class B common stock, Messrs. Max Fuller and Eric Fuller and Ms. Pate (collectively, the \"Qualifying Stockholders\") and certain trusts for the benefit of any of them or their family members or certain entities owned by any of them or their family members (collectively with the Qualifying Stockholders, the \"Class B Stockholders\"), hold approximately 70.2% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Because of the five-to-one voting ratio between our Class B common stock and Class A common stock, the Class B Stockholders collectively will continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of Class B common stock represent at least 16.7% of all outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude the ability of our other stockholders to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future. The interests of the Class B Stockholders may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders, and they may take actions affecting us with which other stockholders disagree. For example, the Class B Stockholders could take actions that would have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control or other business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to us and our stockholders. In addition, certain of the Class B Stockholders have been engaged from time to time in certain related party transactions with us. Further, Messrs. Eric Fuller and Max Fuller and Mses. Pate and Janice Fuller, the wife of Max Fuller, have entered into a voting agreement (the \"Voting Agreement\") under which each has granted a voting proxy with respect\nto the shares of Class B common stock subject to the voting agreement. Mr. Eric Fuller and Ms. Janice Fuller have initially designated Mr. Max Fuller as his or her proxy and Mr. Max Fuller and Ms. Pate have each initially designated Mr. Eric Fuller as his or her proxy. Accordingly, upon death or incapacity of any of Messrs. Eric Fuller or Max Fuller or Ms. Pate, voting control would remain concentrated with certain members of the Fuller and/or Quinn families.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, except for transfers among certain members of the Fuller and Quinn families (or trusts for the benefit of any of them or entities owned by any of them) effected for estate planning or charitable purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term.\nFurthermore, as a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the NYSE rules, we qualify for and, in the future, may opt to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements, including having a majority of independent directors, as well as having nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees composed entirely of independent directors. If in the future we choose to rely on such exemptions, the interests of our Qualifying Stockholders may differ from those of our other stockholders and the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for NYSE-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nWe do not currently expect to pay any cash dividends.\nThe continued operation and growth of our business will require substantial funding. Accordingly, we do not currently expect to pay any cash dividends on shares of our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, including restrictive covenants contained in our financing agreements, restrictions imposed by applicable law, capital requirements and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. Additionally, under our Credit Facility, we are restricted from paying cash dividends except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, in order for stockholders to realize a gain on their investment, the price of our common stock would need to increase, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents or Nevada law may inhibit a takeover, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay for our Class A common stock.\nOur Articles of Incorporation, our Amended and Restated Bylaws (\"Bylaws\"), and Nevada corporate law contain provisions that could delay, discourage or prevent a change of control or changes in our Board of Directors or management that a stockholder might consider favorable. For example, our Articles of Incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and to set the rights, preferences and other terms thereof, including voting rights of those shares; our Articles of Incorporation do not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of stock to elect some directors; our Class B common stock possesses disproportionate voting rights; and our Bylaws provide that a stockholder must provide advance notice of business to be brought before an annual meeting or to nominate candidates for election as directors at an annual meeting of stockholders. These provisions will apply even if the change may be considered beneficial by some of our stockholders, and thereby negatively affect the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our Class A common stock. In addition, to the extent that these provisions discourage an acquisition of our company or other change in control transaction, they could deprive stockholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares of our Class A common stock.\nOur Articles of Incorporation designate the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County of the State of Nevada as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur Articles of Incorporation provide that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County of the State of Nevada will be the sole and exclusive forum for any and all actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, administrative or investigative or that asserts any claim or counterclaim brought in our name or on our behalf, any derivative action (i) asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors,\nofficers or employees to us or our stockholders, (ii) arising or asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision the Nevada Statutes, our Articles of Incorporation or our Bylaws or (iii) asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendant. Any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this provision of our Articles of Incorporation. This choice of forum provision may limit our stockholders' ability to bring certain claims, including claims against our directors, officers or employees, in a judicial forum that the stockholder finds favorable and therefore may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Stockholders who do bring a claim in the Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County could face additional litigation and related costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Nevada. The Eighth Judicial District Court of Clark County may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our Articles of Incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 81021, "SIC": 4210, "TIC": "USX"}
