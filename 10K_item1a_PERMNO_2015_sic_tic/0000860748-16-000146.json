{"cik": "860748", "company": "KEMPER Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nKemper is exposed to numerous risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from recent results or anticipated future results. The following discussion details the significant risk factors that are specific to the Company. In addition to those described below, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected by other factors not presently known by, or considered material to, the Company. Readers are advised to consider all of these factors\nalong with the other information included in this 2015 Annual Report and to consult any further disclosures Kemper makes on related subjects in its filings with the SEC.\nChanges in the application of state unclaimed property laws and related insurance claims handling practices could have a significant effect on (including an acceleration of) the payment and/or escheatment of life insurance death benefits and significantly increase claims handling costs relative to what is currently contemplated by Kemper (the \u201cUnclaimed Property Risk Factor\u201d).\nIn recent years, many states have begun to aggressively expand the application of their unclaimed property laws as they relate to life insurance proceeds. The treasurers or controllers (collectively, \u201cTreasurers\u201d) of a large majority of states have engaged private audit firms to examine the practices and procedures of life insurance companies with respect to the reporting and remittance of proceeds associated with life insurance policies, annuity contracts and retained asset accounts under state unclaimed property laws. Related measures are also being taken or considered by state insurance regulators, both individually and collectively through the auspices of the NAIC, and some state insurance regulators have initiated market conduct examinations focused on claims handling and unclaimed property practices of life insurers. Additionally, since 2012, a number of states have enacted legislation pertaining to unclaimed property.\nAs a result of these audits and examinations, a number of large life insurance groups have agreed to alter historic practices that were previously considered to be lawful and appropriate relative to claims handling and the reporting and remittance of life insurance policy proceeds under state unclaimed property laws. Based on published reports, at least twenty life insurance groups have entered into settlement agreements with state insurance regulators and twenty-four groups with Treasurers. Under the terms of these agreements, the settling companies typically agree to establish a practice of periodically searching for deceased insureds, even prior to the receipt of a claim, by comparing their in-force policy records against a database of reported deaths maintained by the Social Security Administration or a comparable database (collectively, a \u201cDeath Master File\u201d or \u201cDMF\u201d). The settlements usually apply to policies that were in force at any time since January 1, 1992. In conducting these comparisons against a DMF, the insurers are required to use complex \u201cfuzzy\u201d matching criteria which in many cases result in a large volume of potential matches for any given insured. In such cases, the insurer must either assume a costly and administratively burdensome process of disproving any such ambiguous matches which may necessitate a review of older records that are not in electronic form, or accept such matches as valid and escheat the related policy benefits to the states if the beneficiaries cannot be found. All settlements to date with insurance regulators have involved payment of monetary penalties (ranging from about $1.2 million up to $40 million), while settlements with Treasurers have required payment of interest on sums remitted, calculated from the date of death of the insured (rather than from the insurer\u2019s first knowledge of death or receipt of a claim) and extending as far back as 1992. The amounts publicly reported by the settling companies to have been paid to beneficiaries and/or escheated to the states have been substantial. Kemper\u2019s life insurance subsidiaries (the \u201cLife Companies\u201d) have thus far resisted attempts by certain state officials and their designated audit firms to effect changes to the Life Companies\u2019 claims handling and unclaimed property practices of the sort embodied in the foregoing settlements and have challenged through multiple legal proceedings the authority of such officials to require such changes. There can be no assurances that the Life Companies will ultimately be successful in resisting such attempts or any that may arise in the future.\nSeparately, the National Conference of Insurance Legislators (\u201cNCOIL\u201d) has adopted model legislation which, if enacted, would require life insurance companies to compare their in-force life insurance policy records against a DMF for the purpose of identifying potentially deceased insureds with respect to whom the subject life insurance company has not yet received a claim, including due proof of death. Nineteen states have adopted versions of the NCOIL model legislation (the \u201cDMF Statutes\u201d). Nine of such states have enacted DMF Statutes that apply to in-force life insurance policies and if such statutes are construed to apply to life insurance policies in force on each respective statute\u2019s effective date, could have a significant effect on, including an acceleration of, the payment of life insurance benefits to beneficiaries or, in instances where beneficiaries cannot be located, the remittance of such benefits to the states under their unclaimed property laws. Four other states have enacted DMF Statutes that apply only prospectively to insurers, like the Life Companies, that have not previously used a DMF, and six additional states have enacted DMF Statutes that apply only to policies issued on or after their respective effective dates, without regard to prior DMF use. Additionally, in 2015, a drafting subgroup of the NAIC began work on possible model legislation that would also address unclaimed property in the life insurance context; while the future and final provisions of such NAIC model legislation are unclear, the adoption of such model could increase the likelihood that unfavorable legislation could be adopted in states in which the Life Companies operate. Kemper cannot presently predict whether any other states will enact similar legislation or, if enacted, exactly what form such legislation will take.\nThe Life Companies are the subject of an unclaimed property compliance audit (the \u201cTreasurers\u2019 Audit\u201d) by a private audit firm retained by the Treasurers of more than thirty states (the \u201cAudit Firm\u201d). In July 2013, the California State Controller (the \u201cCA Controller\u201d) filed a complaint against the Life Companies in state court in California, seeking an order requiring the Life\nCompanies to produce their in-force insurance policy records to the Audit Firm to enable the firm to perform a comparison of such records against a DMF. The Life Companies have filed a cross-complaint against the CA Controller, adding the Audit Firm and California Insurance Commissioner as cross-defendants. In October 2015, certain of the Life Companies filed a complaint in state court in Illinois seeking a declaration that the Treasurer of the State of Illinois (\u201cthe IL Treasurer\u201d) lacks the authority to compel those Life Companies to produce all in-force policy records to the Audit Firm, which is also a named defendant. See Note 23, \u201cContingencies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the legal proceedings with the CA Controller and IL Treasurer.\nA market conduct examination of the Life Companies was initiated in 2012 by the Illinois Department of Insurance (the \u201cIDOI\u201d), focusing on the Life Companies\u2019 claim settlement and policy administration practices, and specifically compliance with unclaimed property statutes. Five additional states joined the examination in May 2013 (the \u201cMulti-State Exam\u201d) and, shortly thereafter, the Life Companies received requests from the IDOI, as the Multi-State Exam\u2019s managing lead state, for a significant volume of information beyond that which the Life Companies had already produced, including all of the subject Life Companies\u2019 records of in-force policies and other information of the type requested by the Audit Firm as part of the Treasurers\u2019 Audit. This request prompted the Life Companies to file declaratory judgment actions against the insurance regulators of four states (Illinois, California, Pennsylvania and Florida) participating in the Multi-State Exam; these actions include the cross-complaint against the CA Controller described above. In December 2015, the Life Companies voluntarily dismissed the litigation against the IDOI after that department agreed to withdraw the request for records of all in-force policies and advised the Life Companies of the IDOI\u2019s intent to proceed with a single-state market conduct exam without use of a DMF. At least one or more of the states remaining in the Multi-State Exam are expected to continue with the exam, including the attempted use of a DMF. See Note 23, \u201cContingencies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the litigation connected to the Multi-State Exam.\nShould these various efforts by state officials succeed in retroactively imposing new claims handling and escheatment requirements with regard to previously issued life insurance policies, such requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability, financial position and cash flows. The Company\u2019s stance in opposition to the aforementioned actions by state legislators, Treasurers and insurance regulators, including the Life Companies\u2019 initiation of the litigation described above and in Note 23, \u201cContingencies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements, also creates a risk of reputational damage to the Company among various constituencies (including its principal insurance regulators, rating agencies, investors, insurance agents, and current and prospective policyholders), particularly if the Company\u2019s position is not ultimately vindicated. Regardless of the outcome, the Company will incur significant attorneys\u2019 fees, direct litigation and examination costs, and substantial amounts of management time that would otherwise be spent on running the Company\u2019s operations.\nSee Note 23, \u201cContingencies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the sections of the MD&A entitled \u201cLife & Health Insurance\u201d and \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional information on the legal proceedings, including lawsuits, regulatory examinations and inquiries, and other matters described above.\nKemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulation, and the evolving legal and regulatory landscape in which they operate could result in increased operating costs, reduced profitability and limited growth.\nKemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries operate under an extensive insurance regulatory system. Current laws and regulations encompass a wide variety of matters, including policy forms, premium rates, licensing, market conduct, trade practices, claims practices, reserve and loss ratio requirements, investment standards, statutory capital and surplus requirements, restrictions on the payment of dividends, approvals of transactions involving a change in control of one or more insurance companies, restrictions on transactions among affiliates and consumer privacy. They also require the filing of annual and quarterly financial reports and holding company reports. Pre-approval requirements often restrict the companies from implementing premium rate changes for property, casualty and health insurance policies, introducing new, or making changes to existing, policy forms and many other actions. Insurance regulators conduct periodic examinations of Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries and can suspend or delay their operations or licenses, require corrective actions, and impose penalties or other remedies available for compliance failures. For a more detailed discussion of the regulations applicable to Kemper\u2019s subsidiaries and these new developments, see \u201cRegulation\u201d in Item 1, beginning on page 10.\nThese laws and regulations, and their interpretation by the various regulators and courts, are undergoing continual revision and expansion. The legal and regulatory landscape within which Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries conduct their businesses is often unpredictable. As industry practices and regulatory, judicial, political, social and other conditions change, issues may emerge, whether intended or not. These emerging practices, conditions and issues could adversely affect Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries in a variety of ways, including, for example, by expansion of coverages beyond the underwriting intent, increasing the number or size of claims, accelerating the payment of claims or adding to operational costs. Industry practices that were once considered approved, compliant and reasonable may suddenly be deemed unacceptable by virtue of a court or regulatory\nruling or changes in regulatory enforcement policies and practices. One example is the changing application of state unclaimed property laws and related claims handling practices discussed in the preceding risk factor. It is not possible for the Company to predict such shifts in legal or regulatory enforcement or to accurately estimate the impact they may have on the Company and its operations.\nThe financial services industry, including insurance companies and their holding company systems, remains under regulatory scrutiny. While it is not possible to predict how new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may impact the operations of Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries, several developments have the potential to significantly impact such operations. This includes state adoption of extensive modifications to state holding company laws that substantially expand the oversight and examination powers of state insurance regulators beyond licensed insurance companies to their non-insurance affiliates and their organizations as a whole, particularly with respect to enterprise risk. In addition, the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively the \u201cHealth Care Acts\u201d) have resulted in regulations affecting health insurers such as Reserve National, and potential changes to the state insurance regulatory system may result from the Dodd-Frank Act. See the discussion of the NAIC model act and the Dodd-Frank Act under \u201cRegulation\u201d in Item 1, beginning on page 10.\nThese new developments and significant changes in, or new interpretations of, existing laws and regulations could make it more expensive for Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries to conduct and grow their businesses.\nLegal and regulatory proceedings are unpredictable and could produce one or more unexpected verdicts against the Company that could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results for any given period.\nKemper and its subsidiaries are from time to time involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of their businesses. Some of these proceedings may involve matters particular to Kemper or one or more of its subsidiaries, while others may pertain to business practices in the industry in which Kemper and its subsidiaries operate. Some lawsuits may seek class action status that, if granted, could expose the Company to potentially significant liability by virtue of the size of the putative classes. These matters often raise difficult factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and complexities. The outcomes of these matters are difficult to predict, and the amounts or ranges of potential loss at particular stages in the proceedings are in most cases difficult or impossible to ascertain. A further complication is that even where the possibility of an adverse outcome is deemed to be remote using traditional legal analysis, juries sometimes can and do substitute their subjective views in place of facts and established legal principles. Given the unpredictability of the legal and regulatory landscape in which the Company operates, there can be no assurance that one or more of these matters will not produce a result that could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results for any given period.\nFor information about the Company\u2019s pending legal proceedings, see Note 23, \u201cContingencies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCatastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.\nKemper\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, explosions, severe winter weather and wildfires and may include man-made events, such as terrorist attacks and hazardous material spills. The incidence, frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and may be impacted by the uncertain effects of climate change. The extent of the Company\u2019s losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the geographic area affected by the event and the severity of the event. The Company could experience more than one severe catastrophic event in any given period.\nKemper\u2019s life and health insurance subsidiaries are particularly exposed to risks of catastrophic mortality, such as pandemic or other events that result in large numbers of deaths. In addition, the occurrence of such an event in a concentrated geographic area could have a severe disruptive effect on the Company\u2019s workforce and business operations. The likelihood and severity of such events cannot be predicted and are difficult to estimate.\nThe property and casualty insurance subsidiaries use catastrophe modeling tools developed by third parties to project their potential exposure to property damage resulting from catastrophic events under various scenarios. Such models are based on various assumptions and judgments which may turn out to be wrong. The actual impact of one or more catastrophic events could adversely and materially differ from these projections.\nThe availability and cost of catastrophe reinsurance and the ability of reinsurers to meet their obligations could result in Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries retaining more risk and could adversely and materially affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nKemper\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries seek to reduce their exposure to catastrophe losses through the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance. Catastrophe reinsurance does not relieve such subsidiaries of their direct liability to their policyholders. As long as the reinsurers meet their obligations, the net liability for such subsidiaries is limited to the amount of risk that they retain. While such subsidiaries\u2019 principal reinsurers are each rated \u201cA-\u201d or better by A.M. Best at the time reinsurance is purchased, the Company cannot be certain that reinsurers will pay the amounts due from them either now, in the future, or on a timely basis. A reinsurer\u2019s insolvency or inability to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nIn addition, market conditions beyond the Company\u2019s control determine the availability of the reinsurance protection that Kemper\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries may purchase. A decrease in the amount of reinsurance protection that such subsidiaries purchase generally should increase their risk of a more severe loss. However, if the amount of available reinsurance is reduced, such subsidiaries may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms, which could adversely affect the ability of such subsidiaries to write future insurance policies or result in their retaining more risk with respect to such policies.\nThe extent to which Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries can manage their catastrophe exposure through underwriting strategies may be limited by law or regulatory action and could adversely and materially affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nKemper\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries also manage their exposure to catastrophe losses through underwriting strategies such as reducing exposures in, or withdrawing from, catastrophe-prone areas, establishing appropriate guidelines for insurable structures, and setting appropriate rates, deductibles, exclusions and policy limits. The extent to which such subsidiaries can manage their exposure through such strategies may be limited by law or regulatory action. For example, laws and regulations may limit the rate or timing at which insurers may non-renew insurance policies in catastrophe-prone areas or require insurers to participate in wind pools and joint underwriting associations. Generally, an insurer\u2019s participation in such pools and associations are based on the insurer\u2019s market share determined on a state-wide basis. Accordingly, even though Kemper\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries may not incur a direct insured loss as a result of managing direct catastrophe exposures, they may incur indirect losses from required participation in pools and associations. Laws and regulations requiring prior approval of policy forms and premium rates may limit the ability of Kemper\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries to increase rates or deductibles on a timely basis, which may result in additional losses or lower returns than otherwise would have occurred in an unregulated market. See the risk factor above under the title \u201cKemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulation, and the evolving legal and regulatory landscape in which they operate could result in increased operating costs, reduced profitability and limited growth.\u201d\nA significant downgrade in the ratings of Kemper or its insurance subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect the Company.\nThird-party rating agencies assess the financial strength and rate the claims-paying ability of insurance companies based on criteria established by the rating agencies. Third-party ratings are important competitive factors in the insurance industry. Financial strength ratings are used to assess the financial strength and quality of insurers. Ratings agencies may downgrade the ratings of Kemper and/or its insurance subsidiaries or require Kemper to retain more capital in its insurance businesses to maintain existing ratings following developments that they deem negative. This can include factors directly related to the Company, such as an increase in the catastrophic risk retained by Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries, or developments in industry or general economic conditions. A significant downgrade by A.M. Best in the ratings of Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries, particularly those operating in the preferred and standard market or offering homeowners insurance, could result in a substantial loss of business if independent agents and brokers or policyholders of such subsidiaries move to other companies with higher claims-paying and financial strength ratings. Any substantial loss of business could materially and adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of such subsidiaries. A downgrade in Kemper\u2019s credit rating by Standard & Poor\u2019s (\u201cS&P\u201d), Moody\u2019s Investors Services (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d) or Fitch Ratings (\u201cFitch\u201d) may reduce Kemper\u2019s ability to access the capital markets or may increase the cost to refinance existing debt.\nThe insurance industry is highly competitive, making it difficult to grow profitability and within expectations of investors.\nThe Company\u2019s insurance businesses face significant competition, and their ability to compete is affected by a variety of issues relative to others in the industry, such as product pricing, service quality, financial strength and name recognition. Competitive success is based on many factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nCompetitiveness of prices charged for insurance policies;\n\u2022\nSophistication of pricing segmentation;\n\u2022\nDesign and introduction of insurance products to meet emerging consumer trends;\n\u2022\nSelection of agents and other business partners;\n\u2022\nCompensation paid to agents;\n\u2022\nUnderwriting discipline;\n\u2022\nSelectiveness of sales markets;\n\u2022\nEffectiveness of marketing materials and name recognition;\n\u2022\nProduct and technological innovation;\n\u2022\nAbility to settle claims timely and efficiently;\n\u2022\nAbility to detect and prevent fraudulent insurance claims;\n\u2022\nEffectiveness deployment and use of information technology across all aspects of operations;\n\u2022\nAbility to control operating expenses;\n\u2022\nFinancial strength ratings; and\n\u2022\nQuality of services provided to, and ease of doing business with, independent agents and brokers or policyholders.\nThe inability to compete effectively in any of the Company\u2019s insurance businesses could materially reduce the Company\u2019s customer base and revenues and could materially and adversely affect the future results and financial condition of the Company.\nSee \u201cCompetition\u201d in Item 1 of Part I beginning on page 7 and page 10, for more information on the competitive rankings in the property and casualty insurance markets and the life and health insurance markets, respectively, in the United States.\nFailure to maintain the security of personal data may result in lost business, reputational harm, and legal costs and regulatory penalties.\nKemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries obtain and store vast amounts of personal data that can present significant risks to the Company and its customers and employees. An increasing array of laws and regulations govern the use and storage of such data, including, for example, social security numbers, credit card data and personal health information. Despite the implementation of various security measures, the Company\u2019s data systems, or those of its third party administrators working on behalf of the Company, may be vulnerable to security breaches due to the increasing sophistication of cyber-attacks, viruses, malware, hackers and other external hazards, as well as equipment and system failures and inadvertent errors, negligence or intentional misconduct of employees and/or contractors. The Company also relies on the ability of its business partners to maintain secure systems and processes that comply with legal requirements and protect personal data. These increased risks and expanding regulatory requirements related to personal data security expose the Company to potential data loss and resulting damages, reputational risk and significant increases in compliance and litigation costs. Although Kemper maintains cyber risk insurance, there is no guarantee that it will be sufficient to cover all of the costs associated with a data breach.\nIn the event of non-compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, an information security framework for organizations that handle cardholder information for the major debit, credit, prepaid, e-purse, ATM and point-of-sale cards, such organizations could prevent Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries from collecting premium payments from customers by way of such cards and impose significant fines on Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries.\nFailure to maintain the availability of critical systems may result in lost business, reputational harm, and legal costs and regulatory penalties.\nThe Company\u2019s business operations rely on the continuous availability of its computer systems, including computer systems used by third party administrators working on behalf of the Company. In addition to disruptions caused by cyber-attacks or other data breaches, such systems may be adversely affected by natural and man-made catastrophes. The Company\u2019s or its third party administrators\u2019 failure to maintain business continuity in the wake of such events may prevent the timely completion of critical processes across its operations, including, for example, insurance policy administration, claims processing, billing, treasury and investment operations and payroll. These failures could result in significant loss of business, fines and litigation.\nThe Company\u2019s investment portfolio is exposed to a variety of risks that may negatively impact net investment income and cause realized and unrealized losses.\nThe Company maintains a diversified investment portfolio that is exposed to significant financial and capital market risks, including interest rate (risk-free and spread), equity price, and liquidity, as well as risks from changes in tax laws and regulations and other risks from changes in general economic conditions.\nThe interest rate environment has a significant impact on the Company\u2019s financial results and position. In recent years, rates have been at or near historic lows. A protracted low interest rate environment would continue to place pressure on net investment income, particularly related to fixed income securities, short-term investments and limited liability investment companies and limited partnerships accounted for under the equity method of accounting (\u201cEquity Method Limited Liability Investments\u201d) that invest in distressed and mezzanine debt of other companies. A decline in interest rates would generally increase the carrying value of the Company\u2019s fixed income securities and its Equity Method Limited Liability Investments that exhibit debt-like characteristics, but it may adversely affect the Company\u2019s investment income as it invests cash in new investments that may yield less than the portfolio\u2019s average rate. In a declining interest rate environment, borrowers may seek to refinance their borrowings at lower rates and, accordingly, prepay or redeem securities the Company holds as investments more quickly than the Company initially expected. Such prepayment or redemption action may cause the Company to reinvest the redeemed proceeds in lower yielding investments. An increase in interest rates would generally reduce the carrying value of a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, particularly fixed income securities and Equity Method Limited Liability Investments.\nThe Company invests a portion of its investment portfolio in equity securities, which generally have more volatile returns than fixed income securities and may experience sustained periods of depressed values. There are multiple factors that could negatively impact the performance of the Company\u2019s equity portfolio, including general economic conditions, industry or sector deterioration and issuer-specific concerns. A decline in equity values may result in a decrease in dividend income, realized losses upon sales of the securities, or other-than-temporary impairment charges on securities still held.\nInterest rates and equity returns also have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans. In addition to the impact on carrying values and yields of the underlying assets of the funded plans, interest rates also impact the discounting of the projected and accumulated benefit obligations of the plans. A decrease in interest rates may have a negative impact on the funded status of the plans.\nThe nature and cash flow needs of the Company and the insurance industry in general present certain liquidity risks that may impact the return of the investment portfolio. If the Company were to experience several significant catastrophic events over a relatively short period of time, investments may have to be sold in advance of their maturity dates to fund payments to claimants, which could result in realized losses. Additionally, increases in illiquidity in the financial markets may increase uncertainty in the valuations of the Company\u2019s investments. This increases the risk that the fair values reported in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements may differ from the actual price that may be obtained in an orderly sales transaction.\nThe Company has also benefited from certain tax laws related to its investment portfolio, including dividends received deductions and tax-exempt municipal securities. Changes in tax laws may have a detrimental effect on the after-tax return of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio.\nThe Company\u2019s entire investment portfolio is subject to broad risks inherent in the financial markets, including, but not limited to, inflation, regulatory changes, inactive capital markets, governmental and social stability, economic outlooks, unemployment and recession. Changes to these risks and how the market perceives them may impact the financial performance of the Company\u2019s investments.\nKemper and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to various capital adequacy measurements that are significantly impacted by various characteristics of their invested assets, including, but not limited to, asset type, class, duration and credit rating. The Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are also subject to various limitations on the amounts at which they can invest in individual assets or certain asset classes in the aggregate. Asset risk is one factor used by insurance regulators and rating agencies to determine required capital for Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries. Accordingly, a deterioration in the quality of the investments held by Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries or an increase in the investment risk inherent in their investment portfolios could increase capital requirements. See the risk factor below under the title \u201cKemper relies on receiving dividends from its subsidiaries to service its debt, to pay dividends to its shareholders and/or make repurchases of its stock.\u201d These factors may inhibit the Company from shifting its investment mix to produce higher returns. The Company is also subject to concentration of investment risk to the extent that the portfolio is heavily invested, at any particular time, in specific asset types, classes,\nindustries, sectors or collateral types, among other defining features. Developments and the market\u2019s perception thereof in any of these concentrations may exacerbate the negative effects on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio compared to other companies.\nThe determination of the fair values of the Company\u2019s investments and whether a decline in the fair value of an investment is other-than-temporary are based on management\u2019s judgment and may prove to be incorrect.\nThe Company holds a significant amount of assets without readily available, active, quoted market prices or for which fair value cannot be measured from actively quoted prices. These assets are generally deemed to require a higher degree of judgment used in measuring fair value. The assumptions used by management to measure fair values could turn out to be wrong and the actual amounts that may be realized in an orderly transaction with a willing market participant could be either lower or higher than the Company\u2019s estimates of fair value.\nThe Company reviews its investment portfolio for factors that may indicate that a decline in the fair value of an investment is other-than-temporary. This evaluation is based on subjective factors, assumptions and estimates and may prove to be materially incorrect, which may result in the Company recognizing additional losses in the future as new information emerges or recognizing losses currently that may never materialize in the future in an orderly transaction with a willing market participant.\nEstimating losses and LAE for determining property and casualty insurance reserves, or determining premium rates, is inherently uncertain, and the Company\u2019s results of operations may be materially impacted if the Company\u2019s insurance reserves or premium rates are insufficient.\nThe Company establishes loss and LAE reserves to cover estimated liabilities, which remain unpaid as of the end of each accounting period, and to investigate and settle all claims incurred under the property and casualty insurance policies that it has issued. Loss and LAE reserves are established for claims that have been reported to the Company as of the end of the accounting period, as well as for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to the Company. The estimates of loss and LAE reserves are based on the Company\u2019s assessment of the facts and circumstances known to it at the time, as well as estimates of the impact of future trends in the severity of claims, the frequency of claims and other factors. See MD&A, \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates,\u201d under the caption \u201cProperty and Casualty Insurance Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\u201d beginning on page 57 for a discussion of the Company\u2019s reserving process and the factors considered by the Company\u2019s actuaries in estimating the Company\u2019s Property and Casualty Insurance Reserves.\nThe process of estimating property and casualty insurance reserves is complex and imprecise. The reserves established by the Company are inherently uncertain estimates and could prove to be inadequate to cover its ultimate losses and expenses for insured events that have occurred. The estimate of the ultimate cost of claims for insured events that have occurred must take into consideration many factors that are dependent on the outcome of future events associated with the reporting, investigation and settlement of claims. The impacts on the Company\u2019s estimates of property and casualty insurance reserves from these factors are difficult to assess accurately. A change in any one or more of the factors is likely to result in a projected ultimate loss that is different than the previous projected ultimate loss and may have a material impact on the Company\u2019s estimate of the projected ultimate loss. Increases in the estimates of ultimate losses and LAE will decrease earnings, while decreases in such estimates will increase earnings, as reported by the Company in the results of its operations for the periods in which the changes to the estimates are made by the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s actuaries also consider trends in the severity and frequency of claims and other factors when determining the premium rates to charge for its property and casualty insurance products. An unanticipated change in any one or more of these factors or trends, as well as a change in competitive conditions, may also result in inadequate premium rates charged for insurance policies issued by Kemper\u2019s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries in the future. Such pricing inadequacies could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s operating results.\nKemper relies on receiving dividends from its subsidiaries to service its debt, to pay dividends to its shareholders and/or make repurchases of its stock.\nAs a holding company, Kemper depends on the dividend income that it receives from its subsidiaries as the primary source of funds to pay interest and principal on its outstanding debt obligations, to pay dividends to its shareholders and to make repurchases of its stock. Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulatory restrictions under state insurance laws and regulations that limit their ability to declare and pay dividends. These laws and regulations impose minimum solvency and liquidity requirements on dividends between affiliated companies and require prior notice to, and may require approval from, state insurance regulators before dividends can be paid. In addition, third-party rating agencies monitor statutory capital and surplus levels for capital adequacy. Even though a dividend may be payable without regulatory approval, an insurance\nsubsidiary may forgo paying a dividend to Kemper and retain the capital in its insurance subsidiaries to maintain or improve the ratings of Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries, or to offset increases in required capital from increases in premium volume or investment risk. The inability of one or more of Kemper\u2019s insurance subsidiaries to pay sufficient dividends to Kemper may materially affect Kemper\u2019s ability to pay its debt obligations on time, to pay dividends to its shareholders or make repurchases of its stock.\nTechnology initiatives, particularly multi-year initiatives in the Company\u2019s Property & Casualty Insurance segment, to address business developments and regulatory requirements present significant economic and competitive challenges to the Company. Failure to complete and implement such initiatives in a timely manner could result in incurring internal use software development costs that may not be recoverable and the inability to meet emerging consumer and competitive needs which may result in the loss of business.\nData and analytics play an increasingly important role in the insurance industry. While technology developments can facilitate the use of data and analytics, streamline business processes and ultimately reduce the cost of operations, technology initiatives can present significant economic and organizational challenges to the Company and potential short-term cost and implementation risks. In addition, projections of expenses and implementation schedules may be inaccurate and can escalate over time, while the ultimate utility of a technology initiative could deteriorate over time. In 2015, the Company\u2019s Property & Casualty Insurance segment abandoned a multi-year computer software development project intended to replace its aging billing systems and recorded a charge of $11.1 million before taxes to write off the costs to develop such software. In 2014, the Company\u2019s Property & Casualty Insurance segment determined that that it was no longer probable that another multi-year computer software development project intended to replace its aging policy administration systems would be fully implemented and recorded a charge of $54.6 million before taxes to write off the costs to develop such software. The Company continues to believe that it is necessary to replace these systems to remain competitive. In addition, due to the highly-regulated nature of the financial services industry, the Company faces rising costs and competing time constraints in adapting technology to meet compliance requirements of new and proposed regulations. Accordingly, it is in the process of undertaking new multi-year projects to replace these systems.\nThe costs to develop and implement the replacement systems are expected to be material. Due to the complexities involved and the results of the Company\u2019s past attempts to replace these systems, there can be no assurances that the new multi-year projects will be successful and that the costs incurred to develop and implement the replacement systems will be recoverable. Furthermore, failure to implement the replacement systems in a timely manner could result in loss of business from the Company\u2019s inability to design and introduce new insurance products to meet emerging consumer and competitive trends.", "PERMNO": 76136, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "KMPR"}
