{"cik": "1281774", "company": "TOWN SPORTS INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvestors should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may be unable to attract and retain members, which could have a negative effect on our business.\nThe performance of our clubs is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain members, and we may not be successful in these efforts. Most of our members hold month-to-month memberships and accordingly, most members can cancel their club membership at any time without penalty. In addition, we experience attrition and must continually engage existing members and attract new members in order to maintain our membership levels and ancillary sales. There are numerous factors that have in the past and could in the future lead to a decline in membership levels or that could prevent us from increasing our membership, including a decline in our ability to deliver quality service at a competitive cost, the presence of direct and indirect competition in the areas in which the clubs are located, the public\u2019s interest in fitness clubs and general economic conditions. In order to increase membership levels, we may from time to time offer lower membership rates and joining fees. Any decrease in our average membership rates or reductions in joining fees may adversely impact our results of operations.\nNegative economic conditions, including increased unemployment levels and decreased consumer confidence, have in the past contributed to and in the future could lead to significant pressures and declines in economic growth, including reduced consumer spending. In a depressed economic and consumer environment, consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material negative effect on the demand for our services and products and such decline in demand may continue as the economy continues to struggle and disposable income declines. Other factors that could influence demand include increases in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. We believe the challenges to the global economy during the past several years have adversely affected our business and our revenues and profits and continuing challenges may result in additional adverse effects. As a result of these factors, membership levels might not be adequate to maintain our operations at current levels or permit the expansion of our operations.\nIn addition, to the extent our corporate clients are adversely affected by negative economic conditions, they may decide, as part of expense reduction strategies, to curtail or cancel club membership benefits provided to their respective employees. Any reductions in corporate memberships may lead to membership cancellations as we cannot assure that employees of corporate customers will choose to continue their memberships without employer subsidies. A decline in membership levels may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe conversion of certain of our clubs to our high value - low price strategy may negatively impact our comparable club revenue growth and our operating margins.\nWe have adopted a strategic initiative to convert most of our clubs to our new HVLP strategy, which depends in substantial part on our ability to attract a significant number of additional new members at each of our clubs. We expect to initially experience lower revenues and margin pressure in connection with these conversions. To the extent we are unable to attract a sufficient number of new members, or if existing members at such clubs convert their existing memberships to our new lower cost memberships at higher numbers than we have anticipated, our revenues and results of operations will be materially adversely impacted. Further, we expect to incur significant additional advertising expenses in connection with our implementation of this new pricing strategy. Our results of operations will be materially impacted by the new strategy to the extent we do not attract sufficient numbers of new members to offset these costs.\nLow consumer confidence levels, increased competition and decreased spending could negatively impact our financial position and result in club closures and fixed asset and goodwill impairments.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2014, we closed eight clubs, while in 2013 we closed four clubs. We recognized $4.6 million of fixed asset impairments in the year ended December 31, 2014 and $714,000 of fixed asset impairments in the year ended December 31, 2013. In addition, in the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $137,000 related to one outlier club, in part due to decreased membership. Some of our club closures and impairments were due, in large part, to the economic and consumer environment, and increased competition in areas in which our clubs operate. If the economic and consumer environment were to deteriorate or not improve or if we are unable to improve the overall competitive position of our clubs, our operating performance may experience declines and we may need to recognize additional impairments of our fixed assets and goodwill and may be compelled to close additional clubs. In addition, we cannot ensure that we will be able to replace any of the revenue lost from these closed clubs from our other club operations.\nWe have experienced reduced membership levels at many of our clubs. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we tested 36 underperforming clubs and recorded an impairment loss of $4.6 million on fixed assets related to a total of nine clubs, including five underperforming clubs, and three clubs which were closed and one club we expect to convert to a managed location in February 2015. The 27 other clubs tested that did not have impairment charges had an aggregate of $38.3 million of net leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures remaining as of December 31, 2014. The remaining impaired clubs have been converted or we plan to convert to the HVLP pricing strategy in the first half of 2015 other than one club which will be converted into a managed location in February 2015. We expect increased membership under the HVLP strategy. To the extent the HVLP pricing strategy does not meet our expectations, we may record additional impairment charges.\nOur geographic concentration heightens our exposure to adverse regional developments.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we operated 107 fitness clubs in the New York metropolitan market, 30 fitness clubs in the Boston market, 13 fitness clubs in the Washington, D.C. market, five fitness clubs in the Philadelphia market and three fitness clubs in Switzerland. Our geographic concentration in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions and, in particular, the New York metropolitan area, heightens our exposure to adverse developments in these areas, including those related to economic and demographic changes in these regions, competition, severe weather, potential terrorist threats or other unforeseen events.\nFor example, in the year ended December 31, 2012, as a result of flooding and power outages caused by Hurricane Sandy, 131 clubs were closed on October 29, 2012, with one club that closed permanently, 16 clubs that remained closed for over a week and one club that was closed for over a year and reopened in December 2013. We cannot predict the impact that any future severe weather events will have on our ability to avoid wide-spread or prolonged club closures. Any such events affecting the areas in which we operate might result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations in the future.\nAny condition that causes people to refrain, or prevents people, from visiting our clubs, such as severe weather, outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases, or threats of terrorist attacks may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business and operations could be materially and adversely affected by severe weather or outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases, threats of terrorist attacks or other conditions that cause people to refrain, or prevent people, from visiting our clubs. Our business could be severely impacted by a widespread regional, national or global health epidemic. A widespread health epidemic or perception of a health epidemic (such as Ebola), whether or not traced to one of our clubs, may cause members and prospective members to avoid public gathering places or otherwise change their behaviors and impact our ability to staff our clubs. Outbreaks of disease, such as influenza, could reduce traffic in our clubs. Any of these events would negatively impact our business. In addition, any negative publicity relating to these and other health-related matters may affect members\u2019 perceptions of our clubs, reduce member and prospective member visits to our clubs and negatively impact demand for our club offerings.\nFurther, terrorist attacks, such as the attacks that occurred in New York City and Washington, D.C. on September 11, 2001, and other acts of violence or war may affect the markets in which we operate, our operating results or the market on which our common stock trades. Our geographic concentration in the major cities in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions and, in particular, the New York City and Washington, D.C. areas, heightens our exposure to any such future terrorist attacks, which may adversely affect our clubs and result in a decrease in our revenues. The potential near-term and long-term effect these attacks may have for our members, the markets for our services and the market for our common stock are uncertain; however, their occurrence can be expected to further negatively affect the U.S. economy generally and specifically the regional markets in which we operate. The consequences of any terrorist attacks or any armed conflicts are unpredictable; and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe level of competition in the fitness club industry could negatively impact our revenue growth and profitability.\nThe fitness club industry is highly competitive and continues to become more competitive. In each of the markets in which we operate, we compete with other fitness clubs, private studios, physical fitness and recreational facilities established by local governments, hospitals and businesses for their employees, amenity and condominium clubs, the YMCA and similar organizations and, to a certain extent, with racquet and tennis and other athletic clubs, country clubs, weight reducing salons and the home-use fitness equipment industry. We also compete with other entertainment and retail businesses for the discretionary income in our target demographics. We might not be able to compete effectively in the future in the markets in which we operate. Competitors include companies that are larger and have greater resources than us and also may enter these markets to our detriment. These competitive conditions may limit our ability to increase dues without a material loss in membership, attract new members and attract and retain qualified personnel. Additionally, consolidation in the fitness club industry could result in increased competition among participants, particularly large multi-facility operators that are able to compete for attractive acquisition candidates or newly constructed club locations, thereby increasing costs associated with expansion through both acquisitions and lease negotiation and real estate availability for newly constructed club locations.\nThe number of competitor clubs that offer lower pricing and a lower level of service continue to grow in our markets. These clubs have attracted, and may continue to attract, members away from both our fitness-only clubs and our multi-recreational clubs, particularly in the current consumer environment. Furthermore, smaller and less expensive weight loss facilities present a competitive alternative for consumers.\nWe also face competition from competitors offering comparable or higher pricing with higher levels of service or offerings. Larger outer-suburban, multi-recreational family fitness centers, in areas where suitable real estate is more likely to be available, also compete against our suburban, fitness-only models.\nWe also face competition from the increased popularity and demand for private studios offering group exercise classes. The prevalence of these smaller studios may compete against our own studio type offerings, such as cycling, Yoga and Pilates, as well as our new BFX Studio, as consumers may opt to use these competing studios to fulfill their fitness needs.\nIn addition, large competitors could enter the urban markets in which we operate to open a chain of clubs in these markets through one, or a series of, acquisitions.\nOur trademarks and trade names may be infringed, misappropriated or challenged by others.\nWe believe our brand names and related intellectual property are important to our continued success. We seek to protect our trademarks, trade names and other intellectual property by exercising our rights under applicable trademark and copyright laws. If we were to fail to successfully protect our intellectual property rights for any reason, it could have an adverse effect on\nour business, results of operations and financial condition. Any damage to our reputation could cause membership levels to decline and make it more difficult to attract new members.\nIf we are unable to identify and acquire suitable sites for new clubs, our revenue growth rate and profits may be negatively impacted.\nTo successfully expand our business over the long term, we must identify and acquire sites that meet our site selection criteria. In addition to finding sites with the right geographical, demographic and other measures we employ in our selection process, we also need to evaluate the penetration of our competitors in the market. We face competition from other health and fitness center operators for sites that meet our criteria and as a result, we may lose those sites or we could be forced to pay higher prices for those sites. If we are unable to identify and acquire sites for new clubs on attractive terms, our revenue, growth rate and profits may be negatively impacted. Additionally, if our analysis of the suitability of a site is incorrect, we may not be able to recover our capital investment in developing and building the new club.\nWe may experience prolonged periods of losses in our recently opened club and when we open new clubs in existing markets our comparable club revenue growth and our operating margins may be negatively impacted.\nUpon opening a club, we typically experience an initial period of club operating losses. Enrollment from pre-sold memberships typically generates insufficient revenue for the club to initially generate positive cash flow. As a result, a new club typically generates an operating loss in its first full year of operations and substantially lower margins in its second full year of operations than a club opened for more than 24 months. These operating losses and lower margins will negatively impact our future results of operations. This negative impact will be increased by the initial expensing of pre-opening costs, which include legal and other costs associated with lease negotiations and permitting and zoning requirements, as well as depreciation and amortization expenses, which will further negatively impact our results of operations. We may, at our discretion, accelerate or expand our plans to open new clubs, which may adversely affect results from operations.\nWe currently operate clubs throughout the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. In the case of existing markets, our experience has been that opening new clubs may attract some memberships away from other clubs already operated by us in those markets and diminish their revenues. In addition, as a result of new club openings in existing markets and because older clubs will represent an increasing proportion of our club base over time, our mature club revenue increases may be lower in future periods than in the past.\nAnother result of opening new clubs is that our club operating margins may be lower than they have been historically while the clubs build a membership base. We expect both the addition of pre-opening expenses and the lower revenue volumes characteristic of newly opened clubs to affect our club operating margins at these new clubs.\nWe are subject to government regulation, and changes in these regulations could have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations and business practices are subject to federal, state and local government regulation in the various jurisdictions in which our clubs are located, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\ngeneral rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission;\n\u2022\nrules and regulations of state and local consumer protection agencies;\n\u2022\nstate statutes that prescribe certain forms and provisions of membership contracts\n\u2022\nstate statutes that govern the advertising, sale, financing and collection of memberships;\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws and regulations governing privacy and security of information; and\n\u2022\nstate and local health regulations\nAny changes in such laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to claims related to health or safety risks at our clubs.\nUse of our clubs poses some potential health or safety risks to members or guests through physical exertion and use of our services and facilities, including exercise equipment. Claims might be asserted against us for injury suffered by, or death of members or guests while exercising at a club. We might not be able to successfully defend such claims. As a result, we might\nnot be able to maintain our general liability insurance on acceptable terms in the future or maintain a level of insurance that would provide adequate coverage against potential claims.\nDepending upon the outcome, these matters may have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nSecurity and privacy breaches may expose us to liability and cause us to lose customers.\nFederal and state law requires us to safeguard our customers\u2019 financial information, including credit card information. Although we have established security procedures and protocol, including credit card industry compliance procedures, to protect against identity theft and the theft of our customers\u2019 financial information, our security and testing measures may not prevent security breaches and breaches of our customers\u2019 privacy may occur, which could harm our business. For example, a significant number of our users provide us with credit card and other confidential information and authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for our products and services. Typically, we rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to enhance transmission security of confidential information. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and are constantly evolving. These techniques and other advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, inadequate facility security or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us or one of our vendors to protect customer data. We may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive or reactive measures. Several recent, highly publicized data security breaches at other companies have heightened consumer awareness of this issue. Further, a significant number of states require the customers be notified if a security breach results in the disclosure of their personal financial account or other information. Additional states and governmental entities are considering such \u201cnotice\u201d laws. In addition, other public disclosure laws may require that material security breaches be reported.\nAny compromise of our security or that of our third party vendors or noncompliance with privacy or other laws or requirements could harm our reputation, cause our members to lose confidence in us, or harm our financial condition and, therefore, our business. In addition, a party who is able to circumvent our security measures or exploit inadequacies in our security measures or that of our third party vendors, could, among other effects, misappropriate proprietary information, cause interruptions in our operations or expose members to computer viruses or other disruptions. We may be required to make significant expenditures to protect against security breaches or to remedy problems caused by any breaches. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. To the extent the measures taken by us or our third party vendors prove to be insufficient or inadequate, we may become subject to litigation or administrative sanctions, which could result in significant fines, penalties or damages and harm to our reputation.\nLoss of key personnel and/or failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel could make it more difficult for us to develop our business and enhance our financial performance.\nWe are dependent on the continued services of our senior management team, including our Chief Executive Officer and President, Daniel Gallagher. We believe the loss of Mr. Gallagher could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial performance. Currently, we do not have any long-term employment agreements with our executive officers, and we may not be able to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel to meet our business needs.\nDisruptions and failures involving our information systems could cause customer dissatisfaction and adversely affect our billing and other administrative functions.\nThe continuing and uninterrupted performance of our information systems is critical to our success. We use a fully-integrated information system to process new memberships, bill members, check-in members and track and analyze sales and membership statistics, the frequency and timing of member workouts, cross-club utilization, member life, value-added services and demographic profiles by member. This system also assists us in evaluating staffing needs and program offerings. We believe that, without investing in enhancements, this system was approaching the end of its life cycle. Thus, in 2011, we began the process of replacing this system with a new system through a multi-year phase in implementation program which is expected to be completed in 2015. Correcting any disruptions or failures that affect our proprietary system or the new system, as it is implemented, could be difficult, time-consuming and expensive because we would need to use contracted consultants familiar with our system.\nAny failure of our current system could also cause us to lose members and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our members may become dissatisfied by any systems disruption or failure that interrupts our ability to provide our services to them. Disruptions or failures that affect our billing and other administrative functions could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nInfrastructure changes are being undertaken to accommodate our growth, provide network redundancy, better manage telecommunications and data costs, increase efficiencies in operations and improve management of all components of our technical architecture. Fire, floods, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins, acts of terrorism and similar events could damage our systems. In addition, computer viruses, electronic break-ins or other similar disruptive problems could also adversely affect our sites. Any system disruption or failure, security breach or other damage that interrupts or delays our operations could cause us to lose members, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur growth could place strains on our management, employees, information systems and internal controls, which may adversely impact our business.\nFuture expansion will place increased demands on our administrative, operational, financial and other resources. Any failure to manage growth effectively could seriously harm our business. To be successful, we will need to continue to improve management information systems and our operating, administrative, financial and accounting systems and controls. We will also need to train new employees and maintain close coordination among our executive, accounting, finance, marketing, sales and operations functions. These processes are time-consuming and expensive, increase management responsibilities and divert management attention.\nOutsourcing certain aspects of our business could result in disruption and increased costs.\nWe have outsourced certain aspects of our business to third party vendors that subject us to risks, including disruptions in our business and increased costs. For example, we have engaged third parties to host and manage certain aspects of our data center, information and technology infrastructure and electronic pay solutions. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks associated with the vendor's ability to provide these services to meet our needs. If the cost of these services is more than expected, if the vendor is not able to handle the volume of activity or perform the quality of service that we expect, if we or the vendor are unable to adequately protect our data and information is lost, if our ability to deliver our services is interrupted, or if our third party vendors face financial or other difficulties, then our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nOur cash and cash equivalents are concentrated in a small number of banks.\nOur cash and cash equivalents are held, primarily, in a small number of commercial banks. These deposits are not collateralized. In the event these banks become insolvent, we would be unable to recover most of our cash and cash equivalents deposited at the banks. Cash and cash equivalents held in two commercial banks as of December 31, 2014 totaled $85.4 million. During 2014, in any one month, this amount has been as high as approximately $118.0 million.\nRegulatory changes in the terms of credit and debit card usage, including any existing or future regulatory requirements, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur business relies heavily on the use of credit and debit cards in sales transactions. Regulatory changes to existing rules or future regulatory requirements affecting the use of credit and debit cards or the fees charged could impact the consumer and financial institutions who provide card services. This may lead to an adverse impact on our business if the regulatory changes result in unfavorable terms to either the consumer or the banking institutions.\nBecause of the capital-intensive nature of our business, we may have to incur additional indebtedness or issue new equity securities and, if we are not able to obtain additional capital, our ability to operate or expand our business may be impaired and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business requires significant levels of capital to finance the development of additional sites for new clubs and the construction of our clubs. If cash from available sources is insufficient or unavailable due to restrictive credit markets, or if cash is used for unanticipated needs, we may require additional capital sooner than anticipated. In the event that we are required or choose to raise additional funds, we may be unable to do so on favorable terms or at all. Furthermore, the cost of debt financing could significantly increase, making it cost-prohibitive to borrow, which could force us to issue new equity securities. If we issue new equity securities, existing shareholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to execute our current growth plans, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. Any inability to raise additional capital when required could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results.\nWe may incur rising costs related to construction of new clubs and maintaining our existing clubs. If we are not able to pass these cost increases through to our members, our returns may be adversely affected.\nOur clubs require significant upfront investment. If our investment is higher than we had planned, we may need to outperform our operational plan to achieve our targeted return. We cannot assure that we can offset cost increases by increasing our membership dues and other fees and improving profitability through cost efficiencies.\nWe may be required to remit unclaimed property to states for unused, expired personal training sessions.\nWe recognize revenue from personal training sessions as the services are performed (i.e., when the session is trained). Unused personal training sessions expire after a set, disclosed period of time after purchase and are not refundable or redeemable by the member for cash. The State of New York has informed us that it is considering whether we are required to remit the amount received by us for unused, expired personal training sessions to the State of New York as unclaimed property. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $15.2 million of unused and expired personal training sessions that had not been recognized as revenue and was recorded as deferred revenue. We do not believe that these amounts are subject to the escheatment or abandoned property laws of any jurisdiction, including the State of New York. However, it is possible that one or more of these jurisdictions may not agree with our position and may claim that we must remit all or a portion of these amounts to such jurisdiction. This could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows.\nOur growth and profitability could be negatively impacted if we are unable to renew or replace our current club leases on favorable terms, or at all, and we cannot find suitable alternate locations.\nWe currently lease substantially all of our fitness club locations pursuant to long-term leases (generally 15 to 20 years, including option periods). During the next five years, or the period from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2019, we have leases for 25 club locations that are due to expire without any renewal options, three of which expire in 2015, and 48 club locations that are due to expire with renewal options. For leases with renewal options, several of them provide for our unilateral option to renew for additional rental periods at specific rental rates (for example, based on the consumer price index or stated renewal terms already set in the leases) or based on the fair market rate at the location. Our ability to negotiate favorable terms on an expiring lease or to negotiate favorable terms on leases with renewal options, or conversely for a suitable alternate location, could depend on conditions in the real estate market, competition for desirable properties and our relationships with current and prospective landlords or may depend on other factors that are not within our control. Any or all of these factors and conditions could negatively impact our revenue, growth and profitability.\nWe have a stockholders rights plan which could delay or prevent a change in control; implemented in response to significant stock accumulation and threatened proxy contest, which may divert resources and distract management.\nOn December 31, 2014, our Board adopted a stockholder rights plan (the \u201cRights Plan\u201d). The Rights Plan may cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire our Company on terms that our Board does not believe are in our stockholders\u2019 best interest. The Rights Plan is intended to protect stockholders in the event of an unfair or coercive offer to acquire control of the Company and to provide our Board with adequate time to evaluate unsolicited offers. The Rights Plan may prevent or make takeovers or unsolicited corporate transactions with respect to our Company more difficult, even if stockholders consider such transactions favorable, possibly including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. For more information on the Rights Plan, please see the Rights Agreement dated December 31, 2014 filed as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed January 2, 2015.\nThe Rights Plan was implemented in response to PW Partners Atlas Fund III LP and HG Vora Special Opportunities Master Fund, Ltd. and certain of their affiliates (collectively, \u201cWalsh/Vora\u201d) accumulation of a significant position (according to their filings with the SEC, approximately 26%) of the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock and a letter dated December 22, 2014 on behalf of Walsh/Vora threatening to launch a proxy contest in the absence of a settlement that provided them with a majority of the seats on our board. The current holdings of our common stock by Walsh/Vora have not triggered the Rights Plan at this time because such shares or our Common Stock were beneficially owned by them prior to the first public announcement of the adoption of the Rights Plan. However, the acquisition by Walsh/Vora of any additional shares of our common stock, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Rights Plan, may trigger the Rights Plan. On January 7, 2015, we received notice from Walsh/Vora of their intention to nominate six director candidates for election to our Board at our 2015 annual meeting of shareholders. If elected, the Walsh/Vora nominees would constitute a majority of our Board following the 2015 Annual Meeting. A proxy contest could require significant time and attention by management and our Board. Further, any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control could result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe outcome of our publicly announced process of evaluating strategic alternatives is uncertain, may not result in a transaction or may result in the disruption of our business.\nIn February 2015, our Board of Directors announced that it is evaluating strategic alternatives, including a possible sale of the Company, and has retained Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. to assist it in such process. While we intend to complete our evaluation expeditiously, there is no guarantee that the process will result in a sale of the Company or other transaction. In addition, our announcement that we are evaluating various strategic alternatives may make it more difficult to recruit, retain and motivate our employees, may cause disruption in our relationship with vendors or members or may deter potential vendors or members from entering in any business transaction or membership with us until we have announced a final outcome. The potential for a strategic transaction may divert the attention of management and any announcements or speculation regarding the status or result of our process of evaluating strategic alternatives may cause volatility in our stock price. In the event we decide to pursue into a strategic transaction, there is no assurance that such transaction will be completed or will be successful.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nFrom time to time, we are under audit by federal and local tax authorities and we may be liable for additional tax obligations and may incur additional costs in defending any claims that may arise. For example, as of December 31, 2014, certain of our state and local tax returns from years 2006 through 2012 were currently being examined by certain state and local jurisdictions and it is difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of resolution of any particular matter regarding these examinations. In particular, we received from the State of New York a revised assessment related to tax years 2006-2009 for $3.5 million, inclusive of $1.2 million of interest. We have subsequently received a request for additional information from the State of New York. All of the information was submitted by January 2015. We continue to evaluate the merits of the proposed assessment as new information becomes available during continued discussions with the State of New York. We have not recorded a tax reserve related to the proposed assessment. It is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of this or any other tax examination and the result of any such tax examination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Leverage and Our Indebtedness\nOn November 15, 2013, TSI, LLC entered into a $370.0 million senior secured credit facility (\u201c2013 Senior Credit Facility\u201d). The 2013 Senior Credit Facility consists of a $325.0 million term loan facility (\u201c2013 Term Loan Facility\u201d), and a $45.0 million revolving loan facility (\u201c2013 Revolving Loan Facility\u201d). The 2013 Term Loan Facility matures on November 15, 2020, and the 2013 Revolving Loan Facility matures on November 15, 2018.\nWe may be negatively affected by economic conditions in the U.S. and key international markets.\nWe must maintain liquidity to fund our working capital, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance investment opportunities. Without sufficient liquidity, we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue new business opportunities. The principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under our $45.0 million 2013 Revolving Loan Facility. If our current resources do not satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may have to seek additional financing.\nEconomic conditions, both domestic and foreign, may affect our financial performance. Prevailing economic conditions, including unemployment levels, inflation, availability of credit, energy costs and other macro-economic factors, as well as uncertainty about future economic conditions, adversely affect consumer spending and, consequently, our business and results of operations.\nOur leverage may impair our financial condition, and we may incur significant additional debt.\nWe currently have a substantial amount of debt. As of December 31, 2014, our total outstanding consolidated debt was $308.3 million. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, under the 2013 Revolving Loan Facility there were no outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit issued totaled $3.0 million. The unutilized portion of the 2013 Revolving Loan Facility as of December 31, 2014 was $42.0 million and the available unutilized portion, based on the Company\u2019s total leverage ratio exceeding 4.50:1.00 as of December 31, 2014, was $11.3 million. Our substantial debt could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions of clubs and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of interest on our debt, which is variable on our 2013 Revolving Loan Facility and partially variable on our 2013 Term Loan Facility, and/or principal pursuant to excess cash flow requirements and reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions of new clubs and general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations in connection with borrowings under our 2013 Senior Credit Facility, some of which are at variable interest rates;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate.\nThese limitations and consequences may place us at a competitive disadvantage to other less-leveraged competitors.\nIf new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 current debt levels, the related risks that we and they currently face could intensify.\nThe current debt under the 2013 Senior Credit Facility has a floating interest rate and an increase in interest rates may negatively impact our financial results.\nInterest rates applicable to our debt are expected to fluctuate based on economic and market factors that are beyond our control. In particular, the unhedged portion of $148.3 million, of our outstanding debt under our 2013 Senior Credit Facility as of December 31, 2014 has a floating interest rate. Any significant increase in market interest rates, and in particular the short-term Eurodollar rates, would result in a significant increase in interest expense on our debt, which could negatively impact our net income and cash flows.\nThe Company may be unsuccessful in its efforts to effectively hedge against interest rate changes on our variable rate debt.\nIn its normal operations, the Company is exposed to market risk relating to fluctuations in interest rates. In order to minimize the negative impact of such fluctuations on the Company\u2019s cash flows, the Company may enter into derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps. The Company\u2019s current interest rate swap arrangement is with one financial institution and covers $160.0 million of our current $308.3 million outstanding term loan principal balance with the swap expiring on May 15, 2018. We are exposed to credit risk if the counterparty to the agreement is not able to perform on its obligations. Additionally, a failure on our part to effectively hedge against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are required to record the interest rate swap at its fair value. Changes in interest rates can significantly impact the valuation of the instrument resulting in non-cash changes to our financial position.\nCovenant restrictions under our indebtedness may limit our ability to operate our business and, in such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to settle our indebtedness.\nOur 2013 Senior Credit Facility and the agreements related thereto contain, among other things, covenants that may restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities and that may impact our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:\n\u2022\nincur debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions;\n\u2022\npurchase or redeem stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments and extend credit;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nengage in sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nconsummate certain asset sales;\n\u2022\neffect a consolidation or merger or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\ncreate liens on our assets.\nThe 2013 Senior Credit Facility provides for a financial covenant in the situation where the total utilization of the revolving loan commitments (other than letters of credit up to $5.5 million at any time outstanding) exceeds 25% of the aggregate amount of those commitments. In such event, our subsidiaries are required to maintain a total leverage ratio of no greater than 4.50:1.00. While not subject to the total leverage ratio covenant as of December 31, 2014 as the Company\u2019s only utilization of the 2013 Revolving Loan Facility at that date was $3.0 million of issued and outstanding letters of credit thereunder, because the Company\u2019s total leverage ratio as of that date was in excess of 4.50:1.00, the Company is currently not able to utilize more than 25% of the 2013 Revolving Loan Facility. The Company will continue not to be able to utilize more than 25% of the 2013 Revolving Loan Facility until it has a total leverage ratio of no greater than 4.50:1.00.\nEvents beyond our control, including changes in general economic and business conditions, may affect our ability to meet certain financial ratios under the 2013 Senior Credit Facility. We may be unable to meet those tests and the lenders may decide not to waive any failure to meet those tests. A failure to satisfy these tests could limit our ability to obtain funds to pay dividends or cause a default under the 2013 Senior Credit Facility. If an event of default under the 2013 Senior Credit Facility occurs, the lenders could elect to terminate any and all outstanding undrawn commitments to lend and declare all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If any such event should occur, we might not have sufficient assets to pay our indebtedness and meet our other obligations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 91349, "SIC": 7997, "TIC": "CLUB"}
