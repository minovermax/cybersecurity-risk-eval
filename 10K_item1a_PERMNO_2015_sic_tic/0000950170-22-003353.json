RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent to our business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes could affect us are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference herein. This Annual Report on Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us.\nIf any of the following risks occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nGovernmental and individual efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic have introduced volatility into the U.S. and global economy which has and may continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic downturn in early 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced the target federal funds rate to a range of 0.00% to 0.25%. This lower rate reduces the rate of interest we earn on loans and pay on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can affect the value of financial instruments we hold. In an environment with lower interest rates, we will not be able to earn as much on our interest-earning assets, which may reduce net interest margin and our ability to earn interest and receive dividend income from investment securities will be reduced. While the FRB has indicated that it expects to raise the target federal funds rate in response to inflationary pressure and labor market challenges, we cannot assure you that interest rates will increase or that such an increase would increase our net income.\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been confronted with a significant and unfamiliar degree of uncertainty in estimating the impact of the pandemic on credit quality, revenues, and asset values. Our credit risk has fluctuated along with the changes in the U.S. economy: we increased our allowance for credit losses in early 2020 in response to higher unemployment levels, but in 2021, we experienced a benefit from the provision for credit losses as employment levels improved. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral, and we provide an allowance for credit losses based on a number of factors. We believe that the allowance for credit losses is adequate. However, if our assumptions or judgments are wrong, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover the actual credit losses. We may have to increase the allowance in the future in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting changes to the U.S. economy. The actual amount of future provisions for credit losses may vary from the amount of past provisions.\nIf the borrower of a PPP loan under the CARES Act fails to qualify for loan forgiveness under the program, we will have to hold the loan at an unfavorable interest rate as compared to a loan we may otherwise have extended to our customer. Even though those loans are guaranteed by the SBA, we may not be able to collect from the SBA as quickly as those payments come due, and our cash flow and earnings may be reduced accordingly. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which we originated, funded or serviced the PPP loan, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already made payment under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from us.\nAs a lender, we are exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to assure repayment. The collateral securing our indirect loan portfolio in particular may not be sufficient to cover the full value of an outstanding loan because the collateral, namely automobiles, are depreciating assets. If a significant proportion of our customers are unable to repay their loans and the collateral securing repayment is insufficient to cover our losses, we may have to increase our allowance for credit losses, the quality of our loan portfolio will decline, our net income will decrease, and our results of operations will be materially adversely impacted. In addition, our capital and leverage ratios may be adversely impacted.\nContinued economic disruption and fear of the spread of COVID-19 could result in business shutdowns, limitations on commercial activity and financial transactions, labor shortages, supply chain interruptions, increased unemployment and commercial property vacancy rates and reduced profitability and ability for property owners to make mortgage payments.\n- 19 -\nWe believe our most significant exposure to COVID-19-impacted businesses is within the following industries, representing the following percentage of commercial real estate and commercial loan balances as of December 31, 2021:\n\u2022retail and retail building, 14%;\n\u2022hotel, motel and lodging, 4% ;\n\u2022health care, 3%;\n\u2022restaurants and food services, 2%;\n\u2022entertainment and recreation, 2%; and\n\u2022mining, quarrying and oil & gas, less than 1%.\nWe have experienced charge-offs that were precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the $8.2 million charge-off of a $11.9 million commercial loan in the hotel, motel and lodging industry in the first quarter of 2020 and related foreclosure in the third quarter of 2020. We may experience additional charge-offs or credit losses related to the COVID-19 pandemic and other economic disruptions.\nChanges in our operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have exposed us to additional risks.\nSocial distancing efforts imposed by state and local governments to address the COVID-19 pandemic caused us to change how we operate our bank branches, with the interior of some branches closing to customers when required to comply with state or local laws. In addition, to curb the spread of COVID-19, a significant proportion of our employees transitioned to working remotely. Both of these changes may slow response times to customers\u2019 inquiries or preclude providing the level of service our employees are typically able to offer in person. Our reputation and results of operations may be impacted if our competitors are better able to adjust to the restrictions on in-person interactions and remote work.\nFurthermore, as some of our employees continue to work from home, our operational risk, including data security risk, is higher than it would otherwise be, as cybercriminal activity has increased in an attempt to profit from the disruption to pre-pandemic operations. The cybersecurity-related risks we face include more phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks, vulnerability to disruptions of our information technology infrastructure and telecommunications systems for remote operations, and unauthorized dissemination, misuse or destruction of confidential or valuable information.\nWe continue to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\u201cCDC\u201d) guidelines and governmental mandates regarding COVID-19 protocols and vaccinations. While it is not possible to predict the administrative costs, compliance costs or impacts to our available workforce, we are developing compliance processes for implementing the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) testing and vaccination mandates while monitoring legal actions and state legislation regarding the mandates for further guidance.\nMandatory COVID-19 vaccination of employees could impact our workforce and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe imposition of government mandated vaccination or testing may impact our ability to retain current employees and attract new employees. In the event of a vaccine mandate, some of our employees who are not vaccinated may seek exemptions or otherwise resist vaccination. The imposition of vaccine mandates could potentially cause labor shortages if employees refuse to get vaccinated and their employment is terminated, either voluntarily or involuntarily. Although the previously proposed vaccine mandates provide for the alternative of weekly testing for the virus and allow employers to shift the cost burden of this testing to employees, labor markets, competitive forces, and practical application may dictate that we would shoulder the cost of such testing, which could result in meaningful costs that have not been incurred to date. If federal, state or local mandates take effect, those mandates may result in employee attrition, which could adversely affect revenues and costs and could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nCredit Risks and Risks Related to Banking Activities\nIf we experience greater credit losses than anticipated, earnings may be adversely impacted.\nAs a lender, we are exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to assure repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral, and we provide an allowance for estimated credit losses based on a number of factors. We believe that the allowance for credit losses is adequate. However, if our assumptions or judgments are wrong, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover the actual credit losses. We may have to increase the allowance in the future in response to the request of one of our primary banking regulators, to adjust for changing conditions and assumptions, or as\n- 20 -\na result of any deterioration in the quality of our loan portfolio. The actual amount of future provisions for credit losses may vary from the amount of past provisions.\nGeographic concentration may unfavorably impact our operations.\nSubstantially all of our operations are concentrated in the Western and Central New York region. As a result of this geographic concentration, our results depend largely on economic conditions in these and surrounding areas. Deterioration in economic conditions in our market could:\n\u2022increase loan delinquencies;\n\u2022increase problem assets and foreclosures;\n\u2022increase claims and lawsuits;\n\u2022decrease the demand for our products and services; and\n\u2022decrease the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate, reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power, the value of assets associated with non-performing loans and collateral coverage.\nGenerally, we make loans to small to mid-sized businesses whose success depends on the regional economy. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. Adverse economic and business conditions in our market areas, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could reduce our growth rate, affect our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans and, consequently, adversely affect our business, financial condition and performance. For example, we place substantial reliance on real estate as collateral for our loan portfolio. A sharp downturn in real estate values in our market area could leave many of these loans inadequately collateralized. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, the impact on our results of operations could be materially adverse.\nOur commercial business and mortgage loans increase our exposure to credit risks.\nAt December 31, 2021, our portfolio of commercial business and mortgage loans totaled $2.05 billion, or 56% of total loans. We plan to continue to emphasize the origination of these types of loans, which generally expose us to a greater risk of nonpayment and loss than residential real estate or consumer loans because repayment of such loans often depends on the successful operations and income stream of the borrowers. Additionally, such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to consumer loans or residential real estate loans. A sudden downturn in the economy, or a prolonged downturn for specific industries, could result in borrowers being unable to repay their loans, thus exposing us to increased credit risk.\nOur indirect and consumer lending involves risk elements in addition to normal credit risk.\nA portion of our current lending involves the purchase of consumer automobile installment sales contracts from automobile dealers located in Western, Central and the Capital District of New York, and Northern and Central Pennsylvania. These loans are for the purchase of new or used automobiles. We serve customers that cover a range of creditworthiness, and the required terms and rates are reflective of those risk profiles. While these loans have higher yields than many of our other loans, such loans involve risk elements in addition to normal credit risk. Additional risk elements associated with indirect lending include the limited personal contact with the borrower as a result of indirect lending through non-bank channels, namely automobile dealers. While indirect automobile loans are secured, such loans are secured by depreciating assets and characterized by loan-to-value ratios that could result in us not recovering the full value of an outstanding loan upon default by the borrower. If the losses from our indirect loan portfolio are higher than anticipated, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our consumer lending activities are subject to numerous consumer protection laws and regulations, and if we were unable to comply with the regulations applicable to our consumer lending activities, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nLack of seasoning in portions of our loan portfolio could increase risk of credit defaults in the future.\nAs a result of our growth over the past several years, certain portions of our loan portfolio, such as the increased size of our commercial loan portfolio and in particular the PPP loans we originated, are of relatively recent origin. Loans may not begin to show signs of credit deterioration or default until they have been outstanding for some period of time, a process referred to as \u201cseasoning.\u201d As a result, a portfolio of older loans will usually behave more predictably than a newer portfolio. Because these portions of our portfolio are relatively new, the current level of delinquencies and defaults may not represent the level that may prevail as the portfolio becomes more seasoned. If delinquencies and defaults increase, we may be required to increase our provision for loan losses, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n- 21 -\nWe accept deposits that do not have a fixed term and which may be withdrawn by the customer at any time for any reason.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had $3.91 billion of deposit liabilities that have no maturity and, therefore, may be withdrawn by the depositor at any time. These deposit liabilities include our checking, savings, and money market deposit accounts.\nMarket conditions may impact the competitive landscape for deposits in the banking industry. The low rate environment and future actions the Federal Reserve may take may impact pricing and demand for deposits in the banking industry. The withdrawal of more deposits than we anticipate could have an adverse impact on our profitability as this source of funding, if not replaced by similar deposit funding, would need to be replaced with wholesale funding, the sale of interest-earning assets, or a combination of these two actions. The replacement of deposit funding with wholesale funding could cause our overall cost of funding to increase, which would reduce our net interest income. A loss of interest-earning assets could also reduce our net interest income.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. There is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on properties we have foreclosed upon. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage regardless of whether we knew, had reason to know of, or caused the release of such substance. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and market area.\nWe face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources than us. Such competitors primarily include national, regional and internet banks within the markets in which we operate. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting), and merchant banking. Technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. More recently, peer to peer lending has emerged as an alternative borrowing source for our customers and many other non-banks offer lending and payment services, such as consumer credit through buy now - pay later offerings, in competition with banks. Many of these competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many of our larger competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services than we can at competitive prices or with low or no fees.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets;\n\u2022the ability to expand our market position;\n\u2022the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;\n\u2022the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors;\n\u2022customer satisfaction with our level of service; and\n\u2022industry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n- 22 -\nChanges to and replacement of the LIBOR Benchmark Interest Rate may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, a regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the United Kingdom, stated that it will only support the regulatory oversight of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") interest rate indices through 2021. This announcement, and, more generally, financial benchmark reforms and changes in the interbank lending markets, have resulted in uncertainty about the interest rate benchmarks that will be used in the future. In the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates are ongoing, and the Alternative Reference Rate Committee formally recommended the use of a Secured Overnight Funding Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). SOFR is different from LIBOR in that it is a retrospective-looking secured rate rather than a forward-looking unsecured rate. These differences could lead to a greater disconnect between our and the Bank\u2019s costs to raise funds for SOFR as compared to LIBOR. In addition to the discontinuance of LIBOR, there may be future changes in the rules or methodologies used to calculate SOFR or other benchmarks, which may have a material adverse effect on the value of or return on our financial assets and liabilities that are based on or are linked to LIBOR and other benchmarks. Once LIBOR rates are no longer available, and we are required to implement replacement reference rates for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with borrowers, we may incur significant expense in effecting the transition and we may be subject to disputes or litigation with our borrowers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the replacement reference rates. The transition date for existing LIBOR loan contracts is currently set as June 30, 2023 and impacts loans that have not yet matured or have been refinanced by that date. The uncertainty related to these changes may have an unpredictable impact on the financial markets and could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nLegal and regulatory proceedings and related matters could adversely affect us and the banking industry in general.\nWe have been, and may in the future be, subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings, including class action litigation. It is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and there can be no assurance that we will prevail in any proceeding or litigation. Legal and regulatory matters of any degree of significance could result in substantial cost and diversion of our efforts, which by itself could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nAs disclosed in Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d an action has been brought against us by four individuals who sought and were granted class certification to represent classes of consumers who allege to have obtained direct or indirect financing from us for the purchase of vehicles that we later repossessed. On September 30, 2021, the court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification and certified four different classes (two classes of New York consumers and two classes of Pennsylvania consumers). There are approximately 5,200 members in the New York classes and approximately 300 members in the Pennsylvania classes. If we settle these claims or the litigation is not resolved in our favor, we may suffer reputational damage and incur legal costs, settlements or judgments that exceed the amounts covered by our existing insurance policies. We can provide no assurances that our insurer will insure the legal costs, settlements or judgements we incur in excess of our deductible. If we are not successful in defending ourselves from these claims, or if our insurer does not insure us against legal costs we incur in excess of our deductible, the result may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, adverse determinations in such matters could result in actions by our regulators that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. There can be no guarantee that proceedings that may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition will not arise in the near or long-term future.\nWe establish reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We may still incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not established a reserve. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter. The ultimate resolution of a pending legal proceeding, depending on the remedy sought and granted, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAny future FDIC insurance premium increases may adversely affect our earnings.\nThe amount that is assessed by the FDIC for deposit insurance is set by the FDIC based on a variety of factors. These include the depositor insurance fund\u2019s reserve ratio, the Bank\u2019s assessment base, which is equal to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, and various inputs into the FDIC\u2019s assessment rate calculation.\nIf there are financial institution failures, we may be required to pay higher FDIC premiums. Such increases of FDIC insurance premiums may adversely impact our earnings. See the section captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 \u201cBusiness\u201d for more information about FDIC insurance premiums.\n- 23 -\nWe are highly regulated, and any adverse regulatory action may result in additional costs, loss of business opportunities, and reputational damage.\nAs described in the section captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d included in Part I, Item 1, \u201cBusiness,\u201d we are subject to extensive supervision, regulation and examination. The various regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over us have significant latitude in addressing our compliance with applicable laws and regulations including, but not limited to, those governing consumer credit, fair lending, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, capital adequacy, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors affecting us. As part of this regulatory structure, we are subject to policies and other guidance developed by the regulatory agencies with respect to, among other things, capital levels, the timing and amount of dividend payments, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Our regulators have broad discretion to impose monetary fines or restrictions and limitations on our operations if they determine, for any reason, that our operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies.\nThis supervisory framework could materially impact the conduct, growth and profitability of our operations. Any failure on our part to comply with current laws, regulations, other regulatory requirements or safe and sound banking, insurance, or investment advisory practices or concerns about our financial condition, or any related regulatory sanctions or adverse actions against us, could increase our costs or restrict our ability to expand our business and result in damage to our reputation.\nAdditionally, shareholder activism and potential regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, including with respect to environmental, social, and governance matters, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways that may materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe policies of the Federal Reserve have a significant impact on our earnings.\nThe policies of the Federal Reserve impact us significantly. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies directly and indirectly influence the rate of interest earned on loans and paid on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of financial instruments we hold. Those policies determine, to a significant extent, our cost of funds for lending and investing and impact our net interest income, our primary source of revenue. Changes in those policies are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Federal Reserve policies can also affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. For example, a tightening of the money supply by the Federal Reserve could reduce the demand for a borrower\u2019s products and services. This could adversely affect the borrower\u2019s earnings and ability to repay its loan, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Non-Banking Activities\nOur insurance brokerage subsidiary is subject to risk related to the insurance industry.\nSDN derives the bulk of its revenue from commissions and fees earned from brokerage services. SDN does not determine the insurance premiums on which its commissions are based. Insurance premiums are cyclical in nature and may vary widely based on market conditions. As a result, insurance brokerage revenues and profitability can be volatile. As insurance companies outsource the production of premium revenue to non-affiliated brokers or agents such as SDN, those insurance companies may seek to further minimize their expenses by reducing the commission rates payable to insurance agents or brokers, which could adversely affect SDN\u2019s revenues. In addition, there have been and may continue to be various trends in the insurance industry toward alternative insurance markets including, among other things, increased use of self-insurance, captives, and risk retention groups. While SDN has been able to participate in certain of these activities and earn fees for such services, there can be no assurance that we will realize revenues and profitability as favorable as those realized from SDN\u2019s traditional brokerage activities.\nOur investment advisory and wealth management operations are subject to risk related to the regulation of the financial services industry and market volatility.\nThe financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels. It is very difficult to predict the future impact of the legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our business. The securities laws and other laws that govern the activities of our registered investment advisor are complex and subject to change. The activities of our investment advisory and wealth management operations are subject primarily to provisions of the Advisers Act and the Employee Retirement Income Act of 1940, as amended (\u201cERISA\u201d). We are a fiduciary under ERISA. Our investment advisory services are also subject to state laws including anti-fraud laws and regulations.\n- 24 -\nIn addition, the broker-dealer services provided by Courier Capital and HNP Capital are subject to Regulation Best Interest, which requires a broker-dealer to act in the best interest of a retail customer when making a recommendation to that customer of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities. The regulation imposes heightened standards on broker-dealers and will require us to review and modify the policies and procedures of our wealth management operations, as well as associated supervisory and compliance controls.\nAny claim of noncompliance, regardless of merit or ultimate outcome, could subject us to investigation by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Our compliance processes may not be sufficient to prevent assertions that we failed to comply with any applicable law, rule or regulation. If our investment advisory and wealth management operations are subject to investigation by the SEC or other regulatory authorities or if litigation is brought by clients based on our failure to comply with applicable regulations, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur investment advisory revenue may decrease as a result of poor investment performance, in either relative or absolute terms, which could decrease our revenues and net income.\nOur investment advisory business derives a significant amount of its revenues from investment management fees based on assets under management. Our ability to maintain or increase assets under management is subject to a number of factors, including our clients' evaluation of the past performance of our investment advisory business, in either relative or absolute terms, general market and economic conditions, and competition from other investment management firms. A decline in the fair value of the assets under management would decrease our investment advisory revenue.\nInvestment performance is one of the most important factors in retaining existing investment advisory clients and competing for new investment advisory clients. Poor investment performance could reduce our investment advisory revenues and impede the growth of our investment advisory business in the following ways: existing clients may withdraw funds from our investment advisory business in favor of better performing products or firms; asset-based management fees could decline from a decrease in assets under management; our ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish; and the investment advisory personnel may depart to join a competitor or otherwise.\nStrategic and Operational Risks\nWe make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements that may prove to be incorrect, which could significantly impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and we are subject to new or changing accounting rules and interpretations, and the failure by us to correctly interpret or apply these evolving rules and interpretations could have a material adverse effect.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States require us to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including in determining credit loss reserves and reserves related to litigation, among other items. Certain of our financial instruments, including available-for-sale securities and certain loans, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means, which ultimately rely to some degree on management judgment. Some of these and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable price levels, making their valuation particularly subjective, as they are based on significant estimation and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment. If assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses that would impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAs indicated in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations underlying GAAP are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time. In particular, effective January 1, 2020, we have implemented FASB\u2019s Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires us to recognize an allowance for credit losses based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, as opposed to recognizing an allowance when it is probable that a loss has been incurred. This change in GAAP increased our allowance for credit losses and created more volatility in the level of our allowance for credit losses, and has been, and will continue to be, impacted by the Company\u2019s loan and securities portfolios\u2019 composition, attributes and quality. If we fail to interpret any one or more of these GAAP provisions correctly, or if our methodology in applying them to our financial reporting or disclosures is at all flawed, our financial statements may contain inaccuracies that, if severe enough, could warrant a later restatement by us, which in turn could result in a material adverse event.\n- 25 -\nThe value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $67.1 million of goodwill and $7.3 million of other intangible assets. Significant and sustained declines in our stock price and market capitalization, significant declines in our expected future cash flows, significant adverse changes in the business climate or slower growth rates may necessitate our taking charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill. Future regulatory actions could also have a material impact on assessments of goodwill for impairment. If the fair value of our net assets improves at a faster rate than the market value of our reporting units, or if we were to experience increases in book values of a reporting unit in excess of the increase in fair value of equity, we may also have to take charges related to the impairment of our goodwill. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of our goodwill is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIdentifiable intangible assets other than goodwill consist of core deposit intangibles and other intangible assets (primarily customer relationships). Adverse events or circumstances could impact the recoverability of these intangible assets including loss of core deposits, significant losses of customer accounts and/or balances, increased competition or adverse changes in the economy. To the extent these intangible assets are deemed unrecoverable, a non-cash impairment charge would be recorded which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement our growth strategies, including the integration and successful management of newly-acquired businesses.\nOur current growth strategy is multi-faceted. We seek to expand our branch network into nearby areas, continue to invest in our digital banking strategy, develop new sustainable revenue streams through Banking as a Service (BaaS), make strategic acquisitions of loans, portfolios, other regional banks and non-banking firms whose businesses we feel may be complementary with ours, and to continue to organically grow our core deposits. Any failure by us to effectively implement any one or more of these growth strategies could have several negative effects, including a possible decline in the size or the quality, or both, of our loan portfolio or a decrease in profitability caused by an increase in operating expenses.\nWe hope to continue an active merger and acquisition strategy. However, even if we use our common stock as the predominant form of consideration, we may need to raise capital to negotiate a transaction on terms acceptable to us and there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise a sufficient amount of capital to enable us to complete an acquisition. It is also possible that even with adequate capital we may still be unable to complete an acquisition on favorable terms, causing us to miss opportunities to increase our earnings and expand or diversify our operations.\nOur growth strategy is also dependent upon the successful integration of new businesses and any future acquisitions into our existing operations. While our senior management team has had extensive experience in acquisitions and post-acquisition integration, there is no guarantee that our current or future integration efforts will be successful, and if our senior management is forced to spend a disproportionate amount of time on integrating recently-acquired businesses, it may distract their attention from operating our business or pursuing other growth opportunities.\nAcquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value.\nWe intend to continue to pursue a growth strategy for our business by expanding our branch network into communities within or complementary to markets where we currently conduct business. We may consider acquisitions of loans or securities portfolios, lending or leasing firms, commercial and small business lenders, residential lenders, direct banks, banks or bank branches, wealth and investment management firms, securities brokerage firms, specialty finance or other financial services-related companies. We also intend to expand our non-banking subsidiaries, SDN, Courier Capital and HNP Capital, by acquiring smaller insurance agencies, such as Landmark and North Woods and wealth management firms in areas which complement our current footprint. We may be unsuccessful in expanding our non-banking subsidiaries through acquisition because of the growing interest in acquiring insurance brokers and wealth management firms, which could make it more difficult for us to identify appropriate targets and could make such acquisitions more expensive. Even if we are able to identify appropriate acquisition targets, we may not have sufficient capital to fund acquisitions or be able to execute transactions on favorable terms. If we are unable to pursue our growth strategy, we may not be able to achieve all of the expected benefits of our historical acquisitions, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAcquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves potential adverse impact to our financial results and various other risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022difficulty in estimating the value of the target company;\n\u2022payment of a premium over book and market values that may dilute our tangible book value and earnings per share in the short and long term;\n\u2022potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company;\n\u2022exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company;\n\u2022volatility in reported income as goodwill impairment losses could occur irregularly and in varying amounts;\n\u2022challenge and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company;\n\u2022inability to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and other projected benefits;\n\u2022potential disruption to our business;\n- 26 -\n\u2022potential diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention;\n\u2022the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company;\n\u2022potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company; and\n\u2022additional regulatory burdens associated with new lines of business.\nOur tax strategies and the value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities could adversely affect our operating results and regulatory capital ratios.\nOur tax strategies are dependent upon our ability to generate taxable income in future periods. Our tax strategies will be less effective in the event we fail to generate taxable income. Our deferred tax assets are subject to an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized for financial statement purposes. In making this determination, we consider all positive and negative evidence available including the impact of recent operating results, reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and projected earnings within the statutory tax loss carryover period. If we were to conclude that a significant portion of our deferred tax assets were not more likely than not to be realized, the required valuation allowance could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and regulatory capital ratios. In addition, the value of our deferred tax assets could be adversely affected by a change in statutory rates.\nLiquidity is essential to our businesses.\nOur liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access the capital markets or unforeseen outflows of cash. Reduced liquidity may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or us. Our efforts to monitor and manage liquidity risk may not be successful or sufficient to deal with dramatic or unanticipated reductions in our liquidity. In such events, our cost of funds may increase, thereby reducing our net interest income, or we may need to sell a portion of our investment and/or loan portfolio, which, depending upon market conditions, could result in us realizing a loss.\nWe rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for most of our revenue.\nWe are a separate and distinct legal entity from our subsidiaries. A substantial portion of our revenue comes from dividends from our Bank subsidiary. These dividends are the principal source of funds we use to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock, and to pay interest and principal on our debt. Federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that our Bank subsidiary may pay to us. Also, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. In the event our Bank subsidiary is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service debt, pay obligations, or pay dividends on our common and preferred stock. The inability to receive dividends from our Bank subsidiary could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer losses.\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor and report the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit risk, operations risk, compliance risk, reputation risk, strategic risk, market risk, and liquidity risk. We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a framework of policies, procedures and reporting requirements. Management of our risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and/or forecasting models. If the models used to mitigate these risks are inadequate, we may incur losses. In addition, there may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nNegative public opinion could damage our reputation and impact business operations and revenues.\nAs a financial institution, our earnings and capital are subject to risk associated with negative public opinion. Negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, the failure of any of our products or services to meet our clients' expectations or applicable regulatory requirements, corporate governance and acquisitions, social media and other marketing activities, the implementation of environmental, social and governance practices or actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to any of the foregoing. Negative public opinion could affect our ability to attract and/or retain clients, could expose us to litigation and regulatory action, and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price or result in heightened volatility. Negative public opinion could also affect our ability to borrow funds in the unsecured wholesale debt markets.\n- 27 -\nTechnology and Cybersecurity Risks\nWe face competition in staying current with technological changes and banking alternatives to compete and meet customer demands.\nThe financial services market, including banking services, faces rapid changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Our future success may depend, in part, on our ability to use technology to provide products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than we currently have. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. In addition, technology and other changes are allowing consumers to utilize alternative methods to complete financial transactions that have historically involved banks. For example, consumers can now maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and transferring funds directly without using a traditional bank as an intermediary. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of customer deposits, the related income generated from those deposits and additional fee income. We may not be able to effectively compete with these banking alternatives for consumer deposits. As a result, our ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business may be impaired, and our business, financial condition or results of operations, may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and core application processing. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of them not providing us their services for any reason or them performing their services poorly, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers or otherwise conduct our business efficiently and effectively. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nThird parties perform significant operational services on our behalf. These third-party vendors are subject to similar risks as us relating to cybersecurity, breakdowns or failures of their own systems or employees. One or more of our vendors may experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and, if any such event does occur, it may not be adequately addressed, either operationally or financially, by the third-party vendor. Certain of our vendors may have limited indemnification obligations or may not have the financial capacity to satisfy their indemnification obligations. Financial or operational difficulties of a vendor could also impair our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor\u2019s ability to serve us. If a critical vendor is unable to meet our needs in a timely manner or if the services or products provided by such a vendor are terminated or otherwise delayed and if we are not able to develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and cost-effectively, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. Federal banking regulators have proposed rules on managing the risks of how banks select, engage and manage their outside vendors and issued voluntary guidance for banks on similar issues. These regulations and guidance may affect the circumstances and conditions under which we work with third parties and the cost of managing such relationships.\nA breach in security of our or third party information systems, including the occurrence of a cyber incident or a deficiency in cybersecurity, or a failure by us to comply with New York State cybersecurity regulations, may subject us to liability, result in a loss of customer business or damage our brand image.\nWe rely heavily on communications, information systems (both internal and provided by third parties) and the internet to conduct our business. Our business depends on our ability to process and monitor a large volume of daily transactions in compliance with legal, regulatory and internal standards and specifications. In addition, a significant portion of our operations relies heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of personal and confidential information of our customers and clients. These risks may increase in the future as our customers continue to adapt to mobile payment and other internet-based product offerings and we expand the availability of web-based products and applications.\nIn addition, several U.S. financial institutions have experienced significant distributed denial-of-service attacks, some of which involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to disable or degrade service or sabotage systems. Other potential attacks have attempted to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information or destroy data, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. Such security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including persons who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. These cybersecurity concerns are further heightened due to the recent Russian invasion into Ukraine. Those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients. We are also subject to the risk that our employees may intercept and transmit unauthorized confidential or proprietary information. An interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability, remediation costs, regulatory action and reputational harm, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity regulations promulgated by the NY DFS. Any failure by us to comply with these regulations could also result in regulatory sanctions, public disclosure and reputational damage even if we do not experience a significant cybersecurity breach.\n- 28 -\nFurthermore, as the threat of cyber attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our systems, or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities in our systems. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems, the process of enhancing our systems can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues.\nMarket Risks\nWe are subject to interest rate risk, and a rising rate environment may reduce our income and result in higher defaults on our loans, whereas a falling rate environment may result in earlier loan prepayments than we expect, which may reduce our income.\nOur earnings and cash flows depend largely upon our net interest income. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of governmental and regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and investments and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits; (ii) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities; and (iii) the average duration of our mortgage-backed securities portfolio and other interest-earning assets.\nIf the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. In addition, our net interest margin may contract in a rising rate environment because our funding costs may increase faster than the yield we earn on our interest-earning assets. In a rising rate environment, loans with adjustable interest rates are more likely to experience a higher rate of default. The combination of these events may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nEarnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. In addition, in a falling rate environment or the recent environment where the Federal Reserve has held the federal reference rate near 0.00%, loans may be prepaid sooner than we expect, which could result in a delay between when we receive the prepayment and when we are able to redeploy the funds into new interest-earning assets and in a decrease in the amount of interest income we are able to earn on those assets. If we are unable to manage these risks effectively, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nAny substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Also, our interest rate risk modeling techniques and assumptions likely may not fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate changes on our balance sheet.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due us. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on our financial performance and, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which is outside of our control.\nIn addition, we are highly regulated, and our regulators could require us to raise additional common equity in the future. We and our regulators perform a variety of analyses of our assets, including the preparation of stress case scenarios, and as a result of those assessments we could determine, or our regulators could require us, to raise additional capital.\nWe may not be able to access required capital on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers, depositors of the Bank or counterparties participating in the capital markets, or a downgrade of our debt rating, may adversely affect our capital costs and ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\n- 29 -\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nWe may not pay or may reduce the dividends on our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. This could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may issue debt and equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, any of which may be senior to our common stock as to distributions and in liquidation, which could dilute our current shareholders or negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by entering into debt or debt-like financing that is unsecured or secured by all or up to all of our assets, or by issuing additional debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of secured or unsecured commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior notes, subordinated notes, preferred stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities. In the event of our liquidation, our lenders and holders of our debt and preferred securities would receive a distribution of our available assets before distributions to the holders of our common stock. For example, our outstanding shares of Series A 3% and Series B-1 8.48% Preferred Stock have a preferential right to receive dividends before holders of our common stock. We must declare and pay annual dividends of $3 per share to Series A 3% Preferred Stock holders and of $8.48 per share to Series B-1 8.48% Preferred Stock holders before any dividends or dissolution payments can be paid to holders of common stock. Because our decision to incur debt and issue securities in our future offerings will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings and debt financings. Further, market conditions could require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in the future. We may also issue additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock that could dilute our current shareholders and effect the value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and certain banking laws may have an anti-takeover effect.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and federal and state banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders. The combination of these provisions may discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results have varied in the past and could vary significantly in the future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. Our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including the changing U.S. economic environment and changes in the commercial and residential real estate market, any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate. If our operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\n\u2022volatility of stock market prices and volumes in general;\n\u2022changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022changes in conditions in credit markets;\n\u2022changes in accounting policies or procedures as required by the FASB or other regulatory agencies;\n\u2022legislative and regulatory actions subjecting us to additional or different regulatory oversight which may result in increased compliance costs and/or require us to change our business model;\n\u2022government intervention in the U.S. financial system and the effects of and changes in trade and monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board;\n\u2022political instability and uncertainty, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine;\n\u2022additions or departures of key members of management;\n\u2022fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results; and\n\u2022changes in analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance.\n- 30 -\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain skilled people. Competition for highly talented people can be intense, and we may not be able to hire sufficiently skilled people or retain them. Further, the rural location of our principal executive offices and many of our bank branches make it challenging for us to attract skilled people to such locations. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our markets, years of industry experience, and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nWe use financial models for business planning purposes that may not adequately predict future results.\nWe use financial models to aid in planning for various purposes including our capital and liquidity needs, interest rate risk, potential charge-offs, reserves, and other purposes. The models used may not accurately account for all variables that could affect future results, may fail to predict outcomes accurately and/or may overstate or understate certain effects. As a result of these potential failures, we may not adequately prepare for future events and may suffer losses or other setbacks due to these failures.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about or from customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports, and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties, or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports, or other financial information could cause us to enter into unfavorable transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.\nOur financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer, is highly dependent on the business environment in the markets where we operate, in the State of New York and in the United States as a whole. The acts of war in Ukraine and the impact of sanctions on Russia and Russian companies may impact global markets, which may create unfavorable or uncertain economic conditions. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment, natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors. The occurrence of any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, public health emergencies and pandemics, acts of war or terrorism, and other external events could significantly impact our business.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, public health emergencies and pandemics, acts of war or terrorism, and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the operations of our bank branches, stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue, and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. The occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 86965, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FISI"}
