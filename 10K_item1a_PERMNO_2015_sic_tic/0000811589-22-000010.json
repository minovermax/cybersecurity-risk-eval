{"cik": "811589", "company": "FIRST BANCORP /NC/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to other information contained in this Annual Report that may affect us, the risk factors described below, as well as any cautionary language in this Report, provide examples of risks, uncertainties, and events that could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our operating results and financial condition. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, also may materially or adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other unidentified risks.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 (including variants of the virus) pandemic has impacted the local economies in the communities we serve and our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the local, national, and global economies, disrupted global supply chains, increased unemployment, and created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets. The duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects cannot be determined with certainty, but the effects could be present for an extended period of time.\nSince the onset of the pandemic, and as needed for spikes in infection rates, the majority of state and local jurisdictions have imposed, and others in the future may impose, varying levels of restrictions, including \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders, quarantines, executive orders and similar government orders to control the spread of COVID-19 and its variants.\nAt its height, the COVID-19 pandemic and the institution of social distancing and sheltering-in-place requirements resulted in temporary closures of, or operating restrictions, on many businesses. While many of the closed businesses have reopened at varying levels of capacity, the occurrence of variants of the COVID-19 virus may result in future restrictions or closures. As a result, the demand for our products and services may be significantly impacted. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced and may continue to influence the recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and our allowance for credit losses, particularly as some businesses remain closed and as more customers are expected to draw on their lines of credit or seek additional loans to help finance their businesses. Our operations may also be disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including due to illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe economies of our market areas generally improved during 2021 as they recovered from the pandemic. However, the ongoing impact on the Company of the continuing pandemic, including infection rate spikes and new strains of COVID-19, is uncertain. The extent to which the COVID-19 virus and its variants have a further impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nUnfavorable economic conditions could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is subject to periodic fluctuations based on national, regional, and local economic conditions. These fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlled, and may have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition. Our banking operations are primarily locally oriented and community-based. Our retail and commercial banking activities are primarily concentrated within the same geographic footprint. Worsening economic conditions within our markets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Accordingly, we expect to continue to be dependent upon local business conditions as well as conditions in the local residential and commercial real estate markets we serve. Unfavorable changes in unemployment, real estate values, interest rates, and other factors could weaken the economies of the communities we serve. While economic growth and business activity has been generally favorable in our market area in recent years, there can be no assurance that economic conditions will persist, and these conditions could worsen. Unfavorable global economic conditions may have a negative impact on financial markets and could adversely impact our customers, which in turn could lead to lower business activity and higher loan delinquencies. Additionally, financial markets may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including continuing hostilities between Russia and Ukraine, terrorism or other geopolitical events. Weakness in any of our market areas could have an adverse impact on our earnings, and consequently our financial condition and capital adequacy.\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nGlobal cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company and/or its third party service providers. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. Although we employ comprehensive measures to prevent, detect, address, and mitigate these threats (including access controls, employee training, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems), cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses; under CECL our provisions for credit losses may increase significantly and the provisions for credit losses may be more volatile than in the past.\nLike all financial institutions, we maintain an allowance for credit losses to provide for expected losses caused by customer loan defaults. The ACL may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses, and in this case additional and larger provisions for loan losses would be required to replenish the allowance. Provisions for loan losses are a direct charge against income.\nWe adopted CECL as of January 1, 2021. Under the CECL model, credit deterioration is reflected in the income statement in the period of origination or acquisition of the loan, with changes in expected credit losses due to further credit deterioration or improvement reflected in the periods in which the expectation changes. The CECL framework is expected to result in earlier recognition of credit losses and is expected to be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics, and quality of the Company's loan portfolio, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts. We establish the amount of the ACL based on our current estimate of credit losses for the remaining estimated lives of loans in our portfolio. Because of the extensive use of estimates and assumptions, our actual loan losses could differ, possibly significantly, from our estimate. We believe that our ACL at December 31, 2021 is adequate to provide for expected losses, but it is possible that the ACL will need to be increased for changes in economic forecasts, credit deterioration, or that regulators will require us to increase this allowance. An increase in the ACL could materially and adversely affect our earnings and profitability.\nThe CECL standard provides significant flexibility and requires a high degree of judgment with regards to pooling financial assets with similar risk characteristics and adjusting the relevant historical loss information in order to develop an estimate of expected lifetime losses. It also may result in small changes to future forecasts having a significant impact on the allowance, which could make the allowance more volatile, and regulators may impose additional capital buffers to absorb this volatility.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, which could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and supervision from the Commissioner and the Federal Reserve. This regulation and supervision is intended primarily to enhance the safe and sound operation of the Bank and for the protection of the FDIC insurance fund and our depositors and borrowers, rather than for holders of our equity securities and creditors. In the past, our business has been materially affected by these regulations. This trend is likely to continue in the future.\nRegulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on operations, the classification of our assets, and the determination of the level of allowance for credit losses. Changes in the regulations that apply to us, or changes in our compliance with regulations, could have a material impact on our operations.\nVarious federal banking laws and regulations imposed heightened requirements on certain large banks and bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, but certain of these requirements also apply to banks and bank holding companies with at least $10 billion in total consolidated assets. The Company and the Bank exceeded this $10 billion threshold as of December 31, 2021. Among the consequences of the circumstance are the following:\n\u2022the Bank will calculate its FDIC deposit using a \u201cscore card\u201d system using forward-looking measures intended to assess the risk to the DIF;\n\u2022under the Federal Reserve\u2019s rules pursuant to the Durbin Amendment, the Bank is no longer exempt from the Federal Reserve interchange fee maximum and may charge a fee only up to the maximum level determined by the Federal Reserve to be reasonable and proportionate;\n\u2022the Bank will be subject to a continuous supervision model in addition to an annual safety and soundness examination; and\n\u2022the Bank will be examined primarily by the CFPB for compliance with federal consumer protection laws.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance with the BSA and other AML statutes and regulations and related enforcement actions.\nThe BSA, the Patriot Act, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The FINCEN, established by the Treasury to administer the BSA, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as with the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, and Internal Revenue Service. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the OFAC. Federal and state bank regulators also focus on compliance with BSA and AML regulations. If our policies, procedures, and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures, and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing also could have serious reputational consequences for us.\nConsumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts, mutual funds, or general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nNegative public opinion regarding our Company and the financial services industry in general, could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings.\nReputation risk, or the risk to our business, earnings, and capital from negative public opinion regarding our Company and the financial services industry in general, is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion can result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract clients and employees and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Although we have taken steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with our clients and communities, this risk always will be present given the nature of our business.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, and investment banks. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk, which could negatively impact earnings.\nNet interest income is the most significant component of our earnings. Our net interest income results from the difference between the yields we earn on our interest-earning assets, primarily loans and investments, and the rates that we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, primarily deposits and borrowings. When interest rates change, the yields we earn on our interest-earning assets and the rates we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities do not necessarily move in tandem with each other because of the difference between their maturities and repricing characteristics. This mismatch can negatively impact net interest income if the margin between yields earned and rates paid narrows. Interest rate environment changes can occur at any time and are affected by many factors that are outside our control, including inflation, recession, unemployment trends, the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy, domestic and international disorder, and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets.\nIn the normal course of business, we process large volumes of transactions involving millions of dollars. If our internal controls fail to work as expected, we could experience significant losses.\nWe process large volumes of transactions on a daily basis involving millions of dollars and are exposed to numerous types of operational risk, including the risk of fraud by persons inside or outside the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and systems, and breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements. This risk also includes potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards.\nWe establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide us with timely and accurate information about our level of operational risk. These systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate, cost-effective levels. Procedures exist that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and business practices are followed. We continually monitor and improve our internal controls, data processing systems, and corporate-wide processes and procedures, but there can be no assurance that future losses will not occur.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. We rely on a number of different sources in order to meet our potential liquidity demands. Our primary sources of liquidity are increases in deposit accounts, cash flows from loan payments, and our securities portfolio. Borrowings also provide us with a source of funds to meet liquidity demands. An inability to raise funds through from these or other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity.\nOur access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities, or on terms which are acceptable to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include adverse regulatory action against us\nor a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations or deterioration in credit markets.\nIf our goodwill becomes impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe have goodwill recorded on our balance sheet as an asset with a carrying value as of December 31, 2021 of $364.3 million. Under GAAP, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The test for goodwill impairment involves comparing the fair value of a company\u2019s reporting units to their respective carrying values. We have two reporting units - 1) the Bank with $360.0 million in goodwill (including goodwill at the holding company level), and 2) SBA activities, including SBA Complete and our SBA Lending Division, with $4.3 million in goodwill. The price of our common stock is one of several factors available for estimating the fair value of our reporting units and is most closely associated with our Bank reporting unit. Subject to the results of other valuation techniques, if the price of our common stock falls below book value, it could indicate that a portion of our goodwill is impaired. For this reason or other reasons that indicate that the goodwill at any of our reporting units is impaired, we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe might be required to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available or may not be available on terms acceptable to us when it is needed.\nWe are required to maintain adequate capital levels to support our operations. In the future, we might need to raise additional capital to support growth, absorb loan losses, or meet more stringent capital requirements. Our ability to raise additional capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot be certain of our ability to raise additional capital in the future if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to conduct our business could be materially impaired.\nWe may be adversely impacted by the transition from LIBOR as a reference rate.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR and that from January 1, 2022, publications of most LIBOR rates would end. As of this date, LIBOR cannot be used as a reference for new loan originations or other transactions. Currently, many LIBOR rates, including the one-week and two-month settings are no longer available, while the remaining LIBOR rates will be completely phased out by June 30, 2023.\nRegulators, industry groups, and others have, among other things, published recommended replacement language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g. the Secured Overnight Financing Rate), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. There is not yet consensus on what recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted. We have a significant number of loans and borrowings with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR could create considerable costs and additional risk. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition will change our market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design, and hedging strategies. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation. Although we are currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to federal and state fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nFederal and state fair lending laws and regulations, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice, the CFPB, and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. A successful challenge to our performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact our\nCRA rating and result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on or delays in approving merger and acquisition activity, and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFocus on commercial loans may increase the risk of substantial credit losses.\nWe offer a variety of loan products, including residential mortgage, consumer, construction, and commercial loans. At December 31, 2021, approximately 64% of loans were commercial and industrial loans and commercial loans secured by commercial real estate. It is expected that, as we grow, this percentage will remain fairly constant. However, future acquisitions of banks with a portfolio composition different from ours could cause this mix to change. Commercial lending generally involves more risk than mortgage and consumer lending because loan balances are greater, and the borrower's ability to repay is contingent on the successful operation of a business. Risk of loan defaults is unavoidable in the banking industry. We attempt to limit exposure to this risk by monitoring carefully the amount of loans in specific industries and by exercising prudent lending practices. However, the risk that substantial credit losses could result in reduced earnings or losses cannot be eliminated.\nThe Company's focus on lending to small- to mid-sized community-based businesses may increase its credit risk.\nMost of our commercial business and commercial real estate loans are made to small business or middle-market customers. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities and have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. Additionally, these loans may increase concentration risk as to industry or collateral securing our loans. If general economic conditions in the market areas in which we operate negatively impact this important customer sector, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Moreover, a portion of these loans has been made by the Company recently, and the borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle. The deterioration of the borrowers' businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could experience losses due to competition with other financial institutions and non-banks.\nWe face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, both within and beyond our principal markets, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources. Such competitors primarily include national, regional, and internet banks within the various markets in which we operate. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, thrifts, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, and other financial intermediaries, such as online lenders and banks. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative and regulatory changes and continued consolidation. In addition, as customer preferences and expectations continue to evolve, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Banks, securities firms, and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting), and merchant banking. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022the ability to develop, maintain, and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards, and safe, sound assets;\n\u2022the ability to expand our market position;\n\u2022the scope, relevance, and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;\n\u2022the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors;\n\u2022customer satisfaction with our level of service; and\n\u2022industry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to keep pace with technological change could adversely affect our business.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risk.\nFrom time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. We may invest significant time and resources in these efforts. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business and/or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business and/or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reported financial results are impacted by management\u2019s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to the way we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with GAAP and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nCertain accounting policies are critical to presenting our financial condition and results. They require management to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. These critical accounting policies include: the allowance for credit losses; business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets.\nOur business continuity plans or data security systems could prove to be inadequate, resulting in a material interruption in, or disruption to, our business and a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Our daily operations depend on the operational effectiveness of our technology to accurately track and record our assets and liabilities. Any failure, interruption, or breach in security of our computer systems or outside technology could result in failures or disruptions in general ledger, deposit, loan, customer relationship management, and other systems leading to inaccurate financial records. While we have disaster recovery and other policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of any failure, interruption, or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions, or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions, or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory\nscrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, the Bank provides its customers the ability to bank online and through mobile banking. The secure transmission of confidential information over the internet is a critical element of online and mobile banking. While we use qualified third party vendors to test and audit our network, our network could become vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes, and other security issues. The Bank may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or computer viruses. To the extent that the Bank\u2019s activities or the activities of its customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose the Bank to claims, litigation, and other potential liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in the Bank\u2019s systems and could adversely affect its reputation and its ability to generate deposits.\nAdditionally, we outsource the processing of our core data system, as well as other systems such as online banking, to third party vendors. Prior to establishing an outsourcing relationship, and on an ongoing basis thereafter, management monitors key vendor controls and procedures related to information technology, which includes reviewing reports of service auditor\u2019s examinations. If our third party provider encounters difficulties or if we have difficulty in communicating with such third party, it will significantly affect our ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions, which would significantly affect our business operations.\nWe rely on certain external vendors.\nWe are reliant upon certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations. Accordingly, our operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements. We maintain a system of policies and procedures designed to monitor vendor risks including, among other things, changes in the vendor\u2019s organizational structure, changes in the vendor\u2019s financial condition, and changes in the vendor\u2019s support for existing products and services. While we believe these policies and procedures help to mitigate risk, and our vendors are not the sole source of service, the failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or the service level agreements could be disruptive to our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and its financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to losses due to errors, omissions, or fraudulent behavior by our employees, clients, counterparties, or other third parties.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of fraud by employees and third parties, clerical recordkeeping errors, and transactional errors. Our business is dependent on our employees as well as third-party service providers to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions. We could be materially and adversely affected if employees, clients, counterparties, or other third parties caused an operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error, fraudulent manipulation, or purposeful damage to any of our operations or systems.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or to enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information, which we do not independently verify. We also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. Our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected to the extent we rely on financial statements that do not comply with GAAP or are materially misleading, any of which could be caused by errors, omissions, or fraudulent behavior by our employees, clients, counterparties, or other third parties.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to pay cash dividends.\nAlthough we have historically paid cash dividends, there is no assurance that we will continue to pay cash dividends. Future payment of cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, economic conditions, and such other factors as the board may deem relevant.\nFuture sales of our stock by our shareholders or the perception that those sales could occur may cause our stock price to decline.\nAlthough our common stock is listed for trading on NASDAQ under the symbol \u201cFBNC,\u201d the trading volume in our common stock is lower than that of other larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity, and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the relatively low trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock or other volatility in our shares in the public market, could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline or to be lower than it otherwise might be in the absence of those sales or perceptions.\nWe may make future acquisitions, which could dilute current shareholders\u2019 stock ownership and expose us to additional risks.\nIn accordance with our strategic plan, we evaluate opportunities to acquire other banks, branch locations, and companies that provide products and services related to our banking activities. Such transactions could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition, including short- and long-term liquidity, and could require us to issue a significant number of shares of common stock or other securities and/or to use a substantial amount of cash, other liquid assets, and/or incur debt.\nOur acquisition activities could involve a number of additional risks, some of which are described in more detail elsewhere in this report and include: the possibility that expected benefits may not materialize in the timeframe expected or at all, or may be more costly to achieve; using inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management, and market risks with respect to the target institution or assets; incurring the time and expense required to integrate the operations and personnel of the combined businesses; the possibility that we will be unable to successfully implement integration strategies due to challenges associated with integrating complex systems, technology, banking centers, and other assets of the acquired bank in a manner that minimizes any adverse effect on customers, suppliers, employees, and other constituencies; the possibility of regulatory approval for the acquisition being delayed, impeded, restrictively conditioned or denied due to existing or new regulatory issues surrounding the Company, the target institution or the proposed combined entity; and losing key employees and customers as a result of an acquisition that is poorly received.\nWe may issue additional shares of stock or equity derivative securities that will dilute the percentage ownership interest of existing shareholders and may dilute the book value per share of our common stock and adversely affect the terms on which we may obtain additional capital.\nOur authorized capital includes 40,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2021, we had 35,629,177 shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, at that date, we had reserved for issuance 445,231 shares of common stock pursuant to options and restricted stock under our existing equity compensation plan.\nSubject to applicable NASDAQ rules, our Board generally has the authority, without action by or vote of the shareholders, to issue all or part of any authorized but unissued shares of stock for any corporate purpose, including issuances of equity-based incentives under or outside of our equity compensation plans, issuances of equity in business combination transactions, and issuances of equity to raise additional capital to support growth or to otherwise strengthen our balance sheet. Any issuance of additional shares of stock or equity derivative securities will dilute the percentage ownership interest of our shareholders and may dilute the book value per share of our common stock.\nRisks associated with acquisitions and the resulting integrations may affect costs, revenues, and market value.\nA component of our business strategy includes growth through acquisitions. Costs or difficulties related to integrating the acquired business with the Company might be greater than expected. Further, expected revenue and/or operational synergies and cost savings associated with pending or recently completed acquisitions may not be fully realized or realized within the expected time frame.\nAttractive acquisition or expansion opportunities may not be available to us in the future.\nWe may consider acquiring other businesses or expanding into new product lines or markets that we believe will help us fulfill our strategic objectives. We expect that other banking and financial companies, some of which have significantly greater resources, will compete with us to acquire financial services businesses. Our target base of attractive candidates may be limited, and competition could increase prices for potential acquisitions that we believe are attractive. Acquisitions may also be subject to various regulatory approvals. If we fail to receive the appropriate regulatory approvals, we will not be able to consummate acquisitions that we believe are in our best interests.", "PERMNO": 11285, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FBNC"}
