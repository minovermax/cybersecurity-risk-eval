{"cik": "1506439", "company": "SharpSpring, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-05", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nRisks Related To Our Business\nThe majority of our products and services are sold pursuant to short-term subscription agreements, and if our customers elect not to renew these agreements, our revenues may decrease.\nTypically, our products and services are sold pursuant to short-term subscription agreements, which are generally one month to one year in length, with no obligation to renew these agreements. Our renewal rates may decline due to a variety of factors, including the products and services and prices offered by our competitors, new technologies offered by others, consolidation in our customer base or if some of our customers cease their operations. If our renewal rates are low or decline for any reason, or if customers renew on less favorable terms, our revenues may decrease, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to scale our business quickly enough to meet our customers' growing needs, and if we are not able to grow efficiently, our operating results could be harmed.\nAs usage of our marketing software grows and as customers use our solutions for more advanced relationship marketing programs, we will need to devote additional resources to improving our application architecture, integrating with third-party systems, and maintaining infrastructure performance. In addition, we will need to appropriately scale our internal business systems and our services organization, including customer support and professional services, to serve our growing customer base, particularly as our customer demographics expand over time. Any failure of or delay in these efforts could cause impaired system performance and reduced customer satisfaction. These issues could reduce the attractiveness of our marketing software to customers, resulting in decreased sales to new customers, lower renewal rates by existing customers, the issuance of service credits, or requested refunds, which could adversely affect our revenue growth and harm our reputation. Even if we are able to upgrade our systems and expand our staff, any such expansion will be expensive and complex, requiring management time and attention. We could also face inefficiencies or operational failures as a result of our efforts to scale our infrastructure. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with upgrading, improving and expanding our information technology systems. We cannot be sure that the expansion and improvements to our infrastructure and systems will be fully or effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all. These efforts may reduce revenue and our margins and adversely affect our financial results.\nWe rely, in large part, on our agency partners\u2019 ability to resell the SharpSpring solution to their clients and service and support their clients that are using the SharpSpring platform.\nWe sell primarily to digital marketing agencies, who purchase a pack of SharpSpring licenses and resell SharpSpring to their end clients. Our agency partners typically perform various services for their clients, including website services, lead generation activities, social media services and other digital marketing services. If our agency partners are not successful in reselling SharpSpring to their clients or are not successful in supporting or servicing their active clients on the SharpSpring platform, the value of our agency partner relationships will not grow, and those agency partners will have a higher risk of attrition. If we cannot retain these agency partners as SharpSpring customers, our revenue and operating performance will be adversely impacted.\nIf we fail to enhance our existing products and services or develop new products and services, our products and services may become obsolete or less competitive and we could lose customers.\nIf we are unable to enhance our existing products and services or develop new products and services that keep pace with rapid technological developments and meet our customers\u2019 needs, our business will be harmed. Creating and designing such enhancements and new products entail significant technical and business risks and require substantial expenditures and lead-time, and there is no guarantee that such enhancements and new products will be completed in a timely fashion. Nor is there any guarantee that any new service offerings will gain acceptance among our customers or by the broader market. For example, our existing customers may not view any new service as complementary to our service offerings and therefore decide not to purchase such service. If we cannot enhance our existing products and services or develop new products or if we are not successful in selling such enhancements and new products to our customers, we could lose customers or have difficulty attracting new customers, which would adversely impact our financial performance.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers and retain existing customers on a cost-effective basis, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nTo succeed, we must continue to attract and retain a large number of customers on a cost-effective basis, many of whom have not previously used the types of products and services that we offer. Our sales process involves targeting customers, completing product demos and advancing customers through our marketing and sales pipeline to conversion using our SharpSpring marketing automation product, in addition to relying on outbound marketing and search engine traffic to attract potential leads. We rely on a variety of methods to attract new customers, such as outbound emails, hosting events, paying providers of online services, search engines, directories and other websites to provide content, advertising banners and other links that direct customers to our website. If we are unable to use any of our current marketing initiatives or the cost of such initiatives were to significantly increase or such initiatives or our efforts to satisfy our existing customers are not successful, we may not be able to attract new customers or retain existing customers on a cost-effective basis and, as a result, our revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to develop our brands cost-effectively, our business may be adversely affected.\nSuccessful promotion of our brands will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful services at competitive prices. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brands. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands, we may fail to attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business and results of operations could suffer.\nEmail communications is a key component of our product. At times, delivery of our emails has been impaired by third party monitoring agencies and internet service providers. If the delivery of our customers\u2019 emails is limited or blocked, our product\u2019s capabilities would be severely limited, and customers may cancel their accounts.\nMany SharpSpring users aim to communicate using email with a broad range of customers and prospects. Our policies limit the use of email to recipients who have agreed to receive email from that business. However, it is often difficult to enforce the use of opt-in email lists and in some cases, our customers disregard our policies and send emails to purchased lists, which may include spam traps put in place by monitoring agencies. Those same monitoring agencies can block emails from reaching individuals that use their spam email protection services. Additionally, internet service providers (ISPs) also filter email based on email characteristics and spam complaint rates. Although we work with one of the premier email delivery providers, recent aggressive actions by monitoring agencies and ISPs make it more difficult to protect our email sending reputation and deliver our customers\u2019 emails to the recipient. We continually monitor and improve our own technology and work closely with ISPs to maintain our high deliverability rates. If third party agencies or ISPs materially limit or halt the delivery of our customers\u2019 emails, or if we fail to deliver our customers\u2019 emails in an acceptable manner, our customers may cancel their accounts.\nIf we pursue future acquisitions, our inability to successfully acquire and integrate other businesses, assets, products or technologies could harm our operating results.\nWe may in the future evaluate and pursue acquisitions and strategic investments in businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our existing solutions, expand our client base and operations worldwide, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth or cost-saving opportunities. From time to time, we may enter into letters of intent with companies with which we are negotiating potential acquisitions or investments or as to which we are conducting due diligence. Although we are currently not a party to any binding definitive agreement with respect to potential investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, products or technologies, we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future, which could materially decrease the amount of our available cash or require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. We have limited experience in successfully acquiring and integrating businesses, products and technologies. We may not be successful in negotiating the terms of any potential acquisition, conducting thorough due diligence, financing the acquisition or effectively integrating the acquired business, product or technology into our existing business and operations. Our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business, product or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or customer issues.\nAdditionally, in connection with any acquisitions we complete, we may not achieve the synergies or other benefits we expected to achieve, and we may incur write-downs, impairment charges or unforeseen liabilities that could negatively affect our operating results or financial position or could otherwise harm our business. If we finance acquisitions using existing cash, the reduction of our available cash could cause us to face liquidity issues or cause other unanticipated problems in the future. If we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders may be diluted, which could adversely affect the market price of our stock. Further, contemplating or completing an acquisition and integrating an acquired business, product or technology could divert management and employee time and resources from other matters.\nOur international operations subject us to additional risks and uncertainties.\nWe have customers in various international jurisdictions. Our international operations present unique challenges and risks to our Company. Compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and could interfere with our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries or expose us or our employees to fines and penalties. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, tax laws, data privacy and filtering requirements, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in monetary damages, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Our international operations also subject us to additional foreign currency exchange rate risks and will require additional management attention and resources. Our international operations subject us to other inherent risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nthe impact of recessions in economies outside of the United States\n\u25cf\nchanges in and differences between regulatory requirements between countries\n\u25cf\nU.S. and foreign export restrictions, including export controls relating to encryption technologies\n\u25cf\nanti-SPAM laws and other laws that may differ materially from U.S. laws\n\u25cf\nreduced protection for and enforcement of intellectual property rights in some countries\n\u25cf\npotentially adverse tax consequences\n\u25cf\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations\n\u25cf\npolitical and economic instability\n\u25cf\ninternational conflicts, wars or terrorism\n\u25cf\ntariffs and other trade barriers\n\u25cf\nseasonal reductions in business activity\nOur failure to address these risks adequately could materially and adversely affect our business, revenue, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe could be materially affected by the fluctuations of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro, Swiss Franc, South African Rand or British Pound.\nIn our fourth quarter of 2018, approximately 83% of our revenues are currently generated in U.S. Dollars, while approximately 17% of our revenues are denominated in other currencies including the Euro, Swiss Franc, South African Rand and British Pound. Our costs are generally incurred in similar currencies. Currency exchange rates can fluctuate dramatically, which will impact the amount of revenue we will record when translated to U.S. Dollars and will impact the amount of costs that we incur when translated to U.S. Dollars. Although our cost currencies are generally aligned to our revenue currencies, variances exist between the rate we incur costs in each currency compared to the revenue. Therefore, changes to currency rates may dramatically impact profitability.\nIf we do not or cannot maintain the compatibility of our marketing software with third-party applications that our customers use in their businesses, our revenue will decline.\nThe functionality and popularity of our marketing software depends, in part, on our ability to integrate our solutions with third-party applications and platforms, including CRM, event management, e-commerce, call center, and social media sites that our customers use and from which they obtain data. Third-party providers of applications and APIs may change the features of their applications and platforms, restrict our access to their applications and platforms or alter the terms governing use of their applications and APIs and access to those applications and platforms in an adverse manner. Such changes could functionally limit or terminate our ability to use these third-party applications and platforms in conjunction with our solution, which could negatively impact our offerings and harm our business. If we fail to integrate our software with new third-party applications and platforms that our customers use for marketing purposes, we may not be able to offer the functionality that our customers need, which would negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and adversely impact our business.\nThe market in which we participate is competitive and, if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\nOur principal competitors include marketing automation companies like HubSpot, Pardot (part of Salesforce.com) and Act-On. Companies can also utilize various point solutions to provide individual marketing capabilities for things like email campaigns, landing pages, forms and analytics, which are all features in a marketing automation solution. Competition could result in reduced sales, reduced margins or the failure of our products to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could harm our business.\nOur current and potential competitors may have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products. Our current and potential competitors may have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we have. In addition, these companies may have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we have and may be able to bundle products with other products that have gained widespread market acceptance. These competitors may be better able to respond quickly to new technologies and to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns. If we are unable to compete with such companies, the demand for our products could substantially decline.\nOur business is substantially dependent on continued demand for marketing and email technology and any decrease in demand could cause us to suffer a decline in revenues and profitability.\nWe derive, and expect to continue to derive, substantially all of our revenue from organizations, including marketing agencies and small and medium size businesses, associations and non-profits. As a result, widespread acceptance of marketing technology among small and medium size organizations is critical to our future growth and success. The overall market for marketing automation technology is relatively new and still evolving, and small organizations have generally been slower than larger organizations to adopt email marketing as part of their marketing mix. There is no certainty regarding how or whether this market will develop, or whether it will experience any significant contractions. Our ability to attract and retain customers will depend in part on our ability to make marketing communications convenient, effective and affordable. If small and medium size organizations determine that marketing technology and communication does not sufficiently benefit them, existing customers may cancel their accounts and potential customers may decide not to utilize our services.\nWe are a small public company and the requirements of being a public company are a strain on our systems and resources, are a diversion to management\u2019s attention and are costly.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), and the rules and regulations of The NASDAQ Stock Market. The requirements of these rules and regulations increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly and may also place strain on our personnel, systems and resources.\nThe Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing the costly process of implementing and testing our systems to report our results as a public company, to continue to manage our growth and to implement internal controls. We are and will continue to be required to implement and maintain various other control and business systems related to our equity, finance, treasury, information technology, other recordkeeping systems and other operations. As a result of this implementation and maintenance, management's attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe expect these laws, rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to continue obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain appropriate levels of coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee, and qualified executive officers.\nAs a result of being a public company, our business and financial condition is more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the time and resources of our management and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe may be subject to additional obligations to collect and remit sales tax and other taxes, and we may be subject to tax liability for past sales, which could harm our business.\nState, local and foreign jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales, use, value added and other taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. In particular, the applicability of such taxes to SaaS products in various jurisdictions is unclear. Further, these jurisdictions\u2019 rules regarding tax nexus vary significantly and are complex. As such, we could face possible tax assessments and audits. A successful assertion, by any of these taxing authorities, that we should be collecting additional sales, use, value added or other taxes in jurisdictions where we have not historically done so and do not accrue for such taxes could result in tax liabilities and related penalties for past sales, discourage customers from purchasing our products or otherwise harm our business and operating results.\nRisks Related To Our Management\nIf we fail to retain our key personnel, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer.\nOur future depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Our future also depends on the continued efforts and abilities of our executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer and other key personnel, each of whom would be difficult to replace. In particular, Richard Carlson, our Chief Executive Officer and President and Travis Whitton, our Chief Technology Officer, are critical to the Company\u2019s strategic direction and product development process. The loss of the services of Messrs. Carlson, Whitton or other key personnel, and the process to replace any of our key personnel, would involve significant time and expense and may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives. We currently do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our executives. Accordingly, the loss of the services of any of these persons would adversely affect our business.\nOur anticipated growth in our operations could place a significant strain on our management team and our administrative, operational and financial reporting infrastructure.\nOur success will depend in part on the ability of our management team to effectively manage our growth in our operations. To do so, we believe we will need to continue to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. If our new hires perform poorly, or if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing and integrating these new employees, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees, our business may be harmed. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational and financial controls and update our reporting procedures and systems. The expected addition of new employees and the capital investments that we anticipate will be necessary to manage our anticipated growth will increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the short term. If we fail to successfully manage our anticipated growth, our business operations could be adversely affected.\nA material weakness in internal controls may remain undetected for a longer period because of our Company's exemption from the auditor attestation requirements under Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley.\nOur annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management\u2019s report was not subject to attestation by the Company\u2019s registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management\u2019s attestation in its annual report. As a result, a material weakness in our internal controls may, should any occur, remain undetected for a longer period.\nRisks Related To Our Systems\nOur customers\u2019 use of our products to transmit negative messages or website links to harmful applications could damage our reputation, and we may face liability for unauthorized, inaccurate or fraudulent information distributed via our services.\nAlthough it is against our terms and conditions, our customers could use our email servers to transmit negative messages or website links to harmful applications, reproduce and distribute copyrighted material without permission, or report inaccurate or fraudulent data or information. Any such use of our products could damage our reputation and we could face claims for damages, copyright or trademark infringement, defamation, negligence or fraud. Moreover, our customers\u2019 promotion of their products and services through our email marketing product may not comply with federal, state and foreign laws. We cannot predict whether our role in facilitating these activities would expose us to liability under these laws.\nEven if claims asserted against us do not result in liability, we may incur substantial costs in investigating and defending such claims. If we are found liable for our customers\u2019 activities, we could be required to pay fines or penalties, redesign business methods or otherwise expend resources to remedy any damages caused by such actions and to avoid future liability.\nVarious private spam blacklists have in the past interfered with, and may in the future interfere with, the effectiveness of our products and our ability to conduct business.\nOur customers rely on email to communicate with their constituents and we depend on email to market to and communicate with our customers. Various private entities attempt to regulate the use of email for commercial solicitation. These entities often advocate standards of conduct or practice that significantly exceed current legal requirements and classify certain email solicitations that comply with current legal requirements as spam. Some of these entities maintain \u201cblacklists\u201d of companies and individuals, and the websites, ISPs and internet protocol addresses associated with those entities or individuals that do not adhere to those standards of conduct or practices for commercial email solicitations that the blacklisting entity believes are appropriate. If a company\u2019s internet protocol addresses are listed by a blacklisting entity, emails sent from those addresses may be blocked if they are sent to any Internet domain or Internet address that subscribes to the blacklisting entity\u2019s service or purchases its blacklist. Although we have not owned the internet protocol addresses we utilize since the sale of the SMTP product, blacklisting of the internet protocol addresses that the company uses could materially impact our sending ability.\nOur facilities and systems are vulnerable to natural disasters and other unexpected events and any of these events could result in an interruption of our ability to execute clients\u2019 email campaigns.\nWhile we have established contingency plans for certain potential disasters, it is possible that an unexpected disaster may occur, which could interrupt our ability to provide services. We also depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operations of our third-party data centers and hardware systems. The data centers and hardware systems are vulnerable to damage from earthquakes, tornados, hurricanes, fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. If any of these events results in damage to our facilities or third-party data centers or systems, we may be unable to operate our services until the damage is repaired, and may accordingly lose clients and revenues. In addition, subject to applicable insurance coverage, we may incur substantial costs in repairing any damage.\nSystem failures could reduce the attractiveness of our service offerings, which could cause us to suffer a decline in revenues and profitability.\nThe satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of the technology and the underlying network infrastructure are critical to our operations, level of client service, reputation and ability to attract and retain clients. We have experienced periodic interruptions, affecting all or a portion of our systems, which we believe will continue to occur from time to time. We are not aware of any loss of customers due to material service interruptions. However, any systems damage or interruption that impairs our ability to accept and fill client orders could result in an immediate loss of revenue to us, and could cause some clients to purchase services offered by our competitors. In addition, frequent systems failures could harm our reputation. Some factors that could lead to interruptions in customer service include: operator negligence; improper operation by, or supervision of, employees; physical and electronic break-ins; misappropriation; computer viruses and similar events; power loss; computer systems failures; and Internet and telecommunications failures. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to fully compensate us for losses that may occur.\nAny significant disruption in service on our websites or in our computer systems, or in our customer support services, could reduce the attractiveness of our products and result in a loss of customers.\nThe satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our technology and our underlying network infrastructure are critical to our operations, level of customer service, reputation and ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers. Our production system hardware and the disaster recovery operations for our production system hardware are co-located in third-party hosting facilities. None of the companies who host our systems guarantee that our customers\u2019 access to our products will be uninterrupted, error-free or secure. Our operations depend on their ability to protect their and our systems in their facilities against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, air quality, temperature, humidity and other environmental concerns, computer viruses or other attempts to harm our systems, criminal acts and similar events. In the event that our arrangements with third-party data centers are terminated, or there is a lapse of service or damage to their facilities, we could experience interruptions in our service as well as delays and additional expense in arranging new facilities. Any interruptions or delays in access to our services, whether as a result of a third-party error, our own error, natural disasters or security breaches, whether accidental or willful, could harm our relationships with customers and our reputation. Also, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. These factors could damage our brand and reputation, divert our employees\u2019 attention, reduce our revenue, subject us to liability and cause customers to cancel their accounts, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party cloud computing services that we do not control could cause errors or failures of our service, which could cause us to suffer a decline in revenues and profitability.\nWe rely on cloud computing services from third parties that we do not control in order to offer our products, including Google Compute, Amazon Web Services, and others. If we lose the right to use these services or the service malfunctions, our customers could experience delays or be unable to access our services until we can obtain and integrate equivalent technology or a repair is made. Any delays or failures associated with our services could upset our customers and harm our business.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our unpatented proprietary information, processes and know-how and our trade secrets, the value of our technology and services could be adversely affected.\nWe rely upon unpatented proprietary technology, processes and know-how and trade secrets. We do not currently have any patents for our proprietary technology and do not have plans to file for patent protection currently. Further, even if we file for patent protection, there is no assurance that it will be approved by the US Patent and Trademark Office. Although we try to protect this information in part by executing confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties, such agreements may offer only limited protection and may be breached. Any unauthorized disclosure or dissemination of our proprietary technology, processes and know-how or our trade secrets, whether by breach of a confidentiality agreement or otherwise, may cause irreparable harm to our business, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise be independently developed by our competitors or other third parties. If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information, processes and know-how or our trade secrets are disclosed, the value of our technology and services could be adversely affected, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products, which could cause us to suffer a decline in revenues and profitability.\nCustomizations to open source software code generally require developers to make their work available at no cost. Since we have created our software by developing extensions which plug into open source software without modifying the open source code, we do not believe there is a risk we could be required to offer our products or make our source code available. Although we monitor our use of open source software closely, the terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by United States or foreign courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. In such event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue sales of our products, or to release our software code under the terms of an open source license, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.\nGiven the nature of open source software, there is also a risk that third parties may assert copyright and other intellectual property infringement claims against us based on our use of certain open source software programs. The risks associated with intellectual property infringement claims are discussed immediately below.\nIf a third party asserts that we are infringing its intellectual property, whether successful or not, it could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or require us to obtain expensive licenses, and our business may be adversely affected.\nThe software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Third parties may assert patent and other intellectual property infringement claims against us in the form of lawsuits, letters or other forms of communication. These claims, whether or not successful, could:\n\u25cf\ndivert management\u2019s attention;\n\u25cf\nresult in costly and time-consuming litigation;\n\u25cf\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all;\n\u25cf\nin the case of open source software-related claims, require us to release our software code under the terms of an open source license; or\n\u25cf\nrequire us to redesign our software and services to avoid infringement.\nAs a result, any third-party intellectual property claims against us could increase our expenses and adversely affect our business. In addition, many of our agreements with our agency partners require us to indemnify them for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us resulting from an adverse ruling on any such claim. Even if we have not infringed any third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights, we cannot be sure our legal defenses will be successful, and even if we are successful in defending against such claims, our legal defense could require significant financial resources and management time. Finally, if a third party successfully asserts a claim that our products infringe its proprietary rights, royalty or licensing agreements might not be available on terms we find acceptable or at all and we may be required to pay significant monetary damages to such third party.\nIf the security of our customers\u2019 confidential information stored in our systems is breached or otherwise subjected to unauthorized access, our reputation may be severely harmed, we may be exposed to liability and we may lose the ability to offer our customers a credit card payment option.\nOur system stores our customers\u2019 proprietary email distribution lists, credit card information and other critical data. Any accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access could expose us to liability for the loss of such information, adverse regulatory action by federal and state governments, time-consuming and expensive litigation and other possible liabilities as well as negative publicity, which could severely damage our reputation. If security measures are breached because of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, or if design flaws in our software are exposed and exploited, and, as a result, a third party obtains unauthorized access to any of our customers\u2019 data, our relationships with our customers will be severely damaged, and we could incur significant liability. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we and our third-party hosting facilities may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, many states have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause our customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures. Any security breach, whether actual or perceived, would harm our reputation, and we could lose customers and fail to acquire new customers.\nIf we fail to maintain our compliance with the data protection policy documentation standards adopted by the major credit card issuers, we could lose our ability to offer our customers a credit card payment option. Any loss of our ability to offer our customers a credit card payment option would make our products less attractive to many small organizations by negatively impacting our customer experience and significantly increasing our administrative costs related to customer payment processing.\nWe may be the subject of intentional cyber disruptions and attacks.\nWe expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance of our products. Experienced computer programmers, or hackers, may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our data centers and IT environments. These hackers, or others, which may include our employees or vendors, may cause interruptions of our services. Although we continually seek to improve our countermeasures to prevent and detect such incidents, if these efforts are not successful, our business operations, and those of our customers, could be adversely affected, losses or theft of data could occur, our reputation and future sales could be harmed, governmental regulatory action or litigation could be commenced against us and our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related To Our Industry\nExisting federal, state and foreign laws regulate Internet tracking software, the senders of commercial emails and text messages, website owners and other activities, and could impact the use of our marketing tools and potentially subject us to regulatory enforcement or private litigation.\nCertain aspects of how our customers utilize our marketing tools are subject to regulations in the United States, European Union and elsewhere. New and expanding \u201cDo Not Track\u201d regulations have recently been enacted or proposed that protect users' right to choose whether or not to be tracked online. These regulations seek, among other things, to allow consumers to have greater control over the use of private information collected online, to forbid the collection or use of online information, to demand a business to comply with their choice to opt out of such collection or use, and to place limits upon the disclosure of information to third party websites. These policies could have a significant impact on the operation of our marketing software and could impair our attractiveness to customers, which would harm our business.\nCustomers and potential customers in the healthcare, financial services and other industries are subject to substantial regulation regarding their collection, use and protection of data and may be the subject of further regulation in the future. Accordingly, these laws or significant new laws or regulations or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws, regulations or governmental policy may change the way these customers do business and may require us to implement additional features or offer additional contractual terms to satisfy customer and regulatory requirements, or could cause the demand for and sales of our marketing software to decrease and adversely impact our financial results.\nIn addition, U.S., state and foreign jurisdictions are considering and may in the future enact legislation or laws restricting the ability to conduct marketing activities in mobile, social and web channels. Any of the foregoing existing or future restrictions could require us to change one or more aspects of the way we operate our business, which could impair our ability to attract and retain customers, or increase our operating costs or otherwise harm our business. We may be unable to pass along those costs to our customers in the form of increased subscription fees.\nWhile these laws and regulations generally govern our customers\u2019 use of our marketing tools, we may be subject to certain laws as a data processor on behalf of, or as a business associate of, our customers. For example, these laws and regulations governing the collection, use and disclosure of personal information include, in the United States, rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and state breach notification laws, and internationally, the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union and the Federal Data Protection Act in Germany. If we were found to be in violation of any of these laws or regulations as a result of government enforcement or private litigation, we could be subjected to civil and criminal sanctions, including both monetary fines and injunctive action that could force us to change our business practices, all of which could adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our reputation and our business.\nPrivacy concerns and consumers' acceptance of Internet behavior tracking may limit the applicability, use and adoption of our marketing software.\nPrivacy concerns may cause consumers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. We have implemented various features intended to enable our customers to better protect consumer privacy, but these measures may not alleviate all potential privacy concerns and threats. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our services in certain industries. In addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. There are numerous lawsuits in process against various technology companies that collect and use personal information. If those lawsuits are successful, it could impact the way we conduct our business and adversely affect our financial results. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the foregoing laws, regulations, policies and actions may limit the use and adoption of our cloud-based marketing software and reduce overall demand for it, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance or loss of any such action.\nEvolving regulations concerning data privacy may restrict our customers\u2019 ability to solicit, collect, process and use data necessary to conduct email campaigns or to analyze the results or may increase their costs, which could harm our business.\nFederal, state and foreign governments have enacted, and may in the future enact, laws and regulations concerning the solicitation, collection, processing or use of consumers\u2019 personal information. Such laws and regulations may require companies to implement privacy and security policies, permit users to access, correct and delete personal information stored or maintained by such companies, inform individuals of security breaches that affect their personal information, and, in some cases, obtain individuals\u2019 consent to use personal information for certain purposes. Other proposed legislation could, if enacted, prohibit the use of certain technologies that track individuals\u2019 activities on web pages or that record when individuals click through to an Internet address contained in an email message. Such laws and regulations could restrict our customers\u2019 ability to collect and use email addresses, page viewing data, and personal information, which may reduce demand for our products. They may also negatively impact our ability to effectively market our products.\nThe growth of the marketing automation market depends partially on the continued growth and effectiveness of anti-spam products, which may be insufficient to enable us to offer our services at a profit.\nAdoption and retention of email as a communications medium depends on the ability to prevent junk mail, or \u201cspam,\u201d from overwhelming a subscriber\u2019s electronic mailbox. In recent years, many companies have evolved to address this issue and filter unwanted messages before they reach customers\u2019 mailboxes. In response, spammers have become more sophisticated and have also begun using junk messages as a means for fraud. Email protection companies in turn have evolved to address this new threat. However, if their products fail to be effective against spam, adoption of email as a communications tool will decline, which would adversely affect the market for our services.\nAnother economic downturn could negatively affect the business sector, which may cause our customers to terminate existing accounts with us or cause potential customers to fail to purchase our products, resulting in a decrease in our revenue and impairing our ability to operate profitably.\nOur email services are designed specifically for small and medium size organizations, including small and medium size businesses, associations and non-profits that frequently have limited budgets and may be more likely to be significantly affected by economic downturns than their larger, more established counterparts. Small organizations may choose to spend the limited funds that they have on items other than our products and may experience higher failure rates. Moreover, if small organizations experience economic hardship, they may be unwilling or unable to expend resources on marketing, including email marketing, which would negatively affect the overall demand for our products, increase customer attrition and could cause our revenue to decline. In addition, we have limited experience operating our business during an economic downturn. Accordingly, we do not know if our current business model will continue to operate effectively during an economic downturn. Furthermore, we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of potential adverse economic conditions in the U.S. and other countries, but the longer the duration the greater risks we face in operating our business. There can be no assurance, therefore, that worsening economic conditions, or a prolonged or recurring recession, will not have a significant adverse impact on our operating and financial results.\nU.S. federal legislation entitled Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 imposes certain obligations on the senders of commercial emails, which could minimize the effectiveness of our email marketing product, and establishes financial penalties for non-compliance, which could increase the costs of our business.\nThe Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or CAN-SPAM Act, establishes certain requirements for commercial email messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial email messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content. The CAN-SPAM Act, among other things, obligates the sender of commercial emails to provide recipients with the ability to opt out of receiving future emails from the sender. In addition, some states have passed laws regulating commercial email practices that are significantly more punitive and difficult to comply with than the CAN-SPAM Act, particularly Utah and Michigan, which have enacted do-not-email registries listing minors who do not wish to receive unsolicited commercial email that markets certain covered content, such as adult or other harmful products. Some portions of these state laws may not be preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act. The ability of our customers\u2019 constituents to opt out of receiving commercial emails may minimize the effectiveness of our email marketing product. Moreover, non-compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act carries significant financial penalties. If we were found to be in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act, applicable state laws not preempted by the CAN-SPAM Act, or foreign laws regulating the distribution of commercial email, whether as a result of violations by our customers or if we were deemed to be directly subject to and in violation of these requirements, we could be required to pay penalties, which would adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business. We also may be required to change one or more aspects of the way we operate our business, which could impair our ability to attract and retain customers or increase our operating costs.\nAs Internet commerce develops, federal, state and foreign governments may adopt new laws to regulate Internet commerce, which may negatively affect our business.\nAs Internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign governments becomes more likely. Our business could be negatively impacted by the application of existing laws and regulations or the enactment of new laws applicable to email communications. The cost to comply with such laws or regulations could be significant and would increase our operating expenses, and we may be unable to pass along those costs to our customers in the form of increased subscription fees. In addition, federal, state and foreign governmental or regulatory agencies may decide to impose taxes on services provided over the Internet or via email. Such taxes could discourage the use of the Internet and email as a means of commercial marketing and communications, which would adversely affect the viability of our services.\nRisks Related To Owning Our Securities\nWe have a history of losses and do not expect to achieve profitability in the future.\nWe generated a net loss from operations of approximately $8.9 million in 2018. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels in future periods to become profitable, and, even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase our level of profitability. We intend to continue to expend significant funds to expand and grow our marketing automation platform and obtain new customers. Our efforts to grow our business may be more costly than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset higher operating expenses. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays and other unknown events. If we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability, the market price of our common stock may significantly decrease.\nWe may need additional capital in the future, which may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, and may dilute your ownership of our common stock.\nWe have historically relied on outside financing and cash from operations to fund our operations, capital expenditures and expansion. Although the issuance of convertible notes in 2018 provided the Company with additional capital, we may require additional capital from equity or debt financing in the future to:\n\u25cf\nfund our operations;\n\u25cf\nrespond to competitive pressures;\n\u25cf\ntake advantage of strategic opportunities, including more rapid expansion of our business or the acquisition of complementary products, technologies or businesses; and\n\u25cf\ndevelop new products or enhancements to existing products.\nWe may not be able to secure timely additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. The terms of any additional financing may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility. If we raise additional funds through issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our Company, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, if and when we require it, our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nWe may expand through acquisitions of, or investments in, other companies or through business relationships, all of which may result in additional dilution to our stockholders and consumption of resources that are necessary to sustain our business.\nOne of the strategies available to us to grow our business would be to acquire competing or complementary services, technologies or businesses. We also may enter into relationships with other businesses in order to expand our service offerings, which could involve preferred or exclusive licenses, additional channels of distribution or discount pricing or investments in other companies.\nIn connection with one or more of those transactions, we may:\n\u25cf\nissue additional equity securities that would dilute our stockholders;\n\u25cf\nuse cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;\n\u25cf\nincur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay;\n\u25cf\nincur large charges or substantial liabilities;\n\u25cf\nencounter difficulties retaining key employees of the acquired company or integrating diverse business cultures;\n\u25cf\nbecome subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges; and\n\u25cf\nencounter unfavorable reactions from investment banking market analysts who disapprove of our completed acquisitions.\nOur board of directors has the authority, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with terms that may not be beneficial to existing common stockholders and with the ability to affect adversely stockholder voting power and perpetuate their control over us.\nOur certificate of incorporation allows us to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our stockholders. Our board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. Our board of directors also has the authority to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval, including large blocks of preferred stock. As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders thereof the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock or other preferred stockholders and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock or existing preferred stock, if any.\nPreferred stock could be used to dilute a potential hostile acquirer. Accordingly, any future issuance of preferred stock or any rights to purchase preferred stock may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us. This may delay, defer or prevent a change of control or an unsolicited acquisition proposal. The issuance of preferred stock also could decrease the amount of earnings attributable to, and assets available for distribution to, the holders of our common stock and could adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of the holders of our common stock and preferred stock.\nA sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline and may impair our ability to raise capital in the future.\nOur common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market and, despite certain increases of trading volume from time to time, our common stock is considered \u201cthinly-traded,\u201d meaning that the number of persons interested in trading our common stock at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. Finance transactions resulting in a large amount of newly issued shares that become readily tradable, or other events that cause current stockholders to sell shares, could place downward pressure on the trading price of our stock. The lack of a robust resale market may require a stockholder who desires to sell a large number of shares of common stock to sell the shares in increments over time to mitigate any adverse impact of the sales on the market price of our stock.\nIf our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell for various reasons, including the ending of restriction on resale, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, the market price of our common stock could fall. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate. We may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management\u2019s attention and harm our business.\nOur amended certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and certain provisions of Delaware corporate law, as well as certain of our contracts, contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nDelaware law, as well as our amended certificate of incorporation and bylaws, contains anti-takeover provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our Company, even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nThese provisions could lower the price that future investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock. These anti-takeover provisions:\n\u25cf\nauthorize our board of directors to create and issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock, thereby increasing the number of outstanding shares, which can deter or prevent a takeover attempt;\n\u25cf\nprohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u25cf\nempower our board of directors to fill any vacancy on our board of directors, whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise;\n\u25cf\nprovide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u25cf\nprovide that our directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in the election of directors.\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the terms of our employee stock option agreements and other contractual provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our Company. Section 203 generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for three years after the date the stockholder became an interested stockholder. Our employee stock option agreements include change-in-control provisions that allow us to grant options or stock purchase rights that may become vested immediately upon a change in control. The terms of change of control provisions contained in certain of our senior executive employee agreements may also discourage a change in control of our Company. Our board of directors also has the power to adopt a stockholder rights plan that could delay or prevent a change in control of our Company even if the change in control is generally beneficial to our stockholders. These plans, sometimes called \u201cpoison pills,\u201d are oftentimes criticized by institutional investors or their advisors and could affect our rating by such investors or advisors. If our board of directors adopts such a plan, it might have the effect of reducing the price that new investors are willing to pay for shares of our common stock.\nTogether, these charter, statutory and contractual provisions could make the removal of our management and directors more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock. Furthermore, the existence of the foregoing provisions, as well as the significant common stock beneficially owned by our founder, executive officers, and members of our board of directors, could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our Company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price could decline substantially.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate, and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the trading price of our common stock could decline. Some of the important factors that could cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:\n\u25cf\nour ability to retain existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers\u2019 requirements;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our pricing policies;\n\u25cf\nour ability to expand our business;\n\u25cf\nour ability to successfully integrate our acquired businesses;\n\u25cf\nnew product and service introductions;\n\u25cf\ntechnical difficulties or interruptions in our services;\n\u25cf\nthe timing of additional investments in our hardware and software systems;\n\u25cf\nregulatory compliance costs;\n\u25cf\ncosts associated with future acquisitions of technologies and businesses; and\n\u25cf\nextraordinary expenses such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments.\nSome of these factors are not within our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them may cause our operating results to vary widely. As such, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\nOur common stock is subject to volatility.\nWe cannot assure you that the market price for our common stock will remain at its current level, and a decrease in the market price could result in substantial losses for investors. The market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by one or more of the following factors:\n\u25cf\nannouncements or press releases relating to our industry or to our own business or prospects;\n\u25cf\nregulatory, legislative, or other developments affecting us or our industry generally;\n\u25cf\nsales by holders of restricted securities pursuant to effective registration statements or exemptions from registration; and\n\u25cf\nmarket conditions specific to our company, our industry and the stock market generally.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We currently have two independent research analysts covering our stock and may not obtain additional research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no additional securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price for our common stock could be negatively affected. In the event any analyst who covers us downgrades our securities, the price of our securities would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to publish regular reports on us, interest in the purchase of our securities could decrease, which could cause the price of our common stock and its trading volume to decline.\nRisks Related to our Convertible Notes\nOn March 28, 2018, the Company issued $8.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes (the \u201cNotes\u201d). Interest accrues at a rate of 5.0% per year and is \u201cpayable in kind\u201d annually in the form of the issuance of additional notes (\u201cPIK Notes\u201d). The aggregate principal amount of the Note and the PIK Notes will be due and payable in full on the fifth anniversary of the date of the Notes if the Notes are not converted earlier.\nIf the Notes are converted, the Company will issue a significant number of shares of common stock, and the ownership interests of existing stockholders will be significantly diluted.\nThe holder of the Notes may convert the Notes into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at any time prior to maturity at a fixed conversion price of $7.50 per share. If the Notes are converted by the holder, a minimum of 1,107,240 new shares of the Company\u2019s common stock will be issued (as of December 31, 2018) and the ownership interest of existing stockholders will be significantly diluted. The number of shares to be issued upon conversion of the Notes will increase over time with the issuance of additional PIK Notes, which will increase the potential dilution of the ownership interests of existing stockholders.\nUnder certain circumstances, the Company will be required to register with the SEC the resale of shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the Notes, which may not be aligned with Company priorities or the interests of other stockholders.\nIf the Notes are converted into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, if the Company elects to repay the Notes with shares of common stock, or under other specified circumstances, the holder of the Notes (or the underlying shares) will be entitled to demand and piggyback registration rights with respect to resales of the shares. These rights may adversely affect the market for and the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock, the Company\u2019s ability to raise capital in the future to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes, or the timing or terms of any such capital raise.\nIf the Notes are not converted by the holder prior to maturity, we will be required to repay the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes, including the accrued PIK Notes, and it is likely that shareholders will experience significant dilution if that occurs.\nIf the Notes are not converted prior to maturity by the holder, the Company will have the option to:\n\u25cf\nRepay the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes, including accrued PIK Notes, in cash;\n\u25cf\nRepay the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes, including accrued PIK Notes, by issuing shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at value equal to 80% of the volume weighted average share price over the preceding 30-trading day period; or\n\u25cf\nExtend the maturity of the Notes for up to eighteen months at an increased interest rate of 10.0%.\nAssuming all of the Notes, including accrued PIK Notes, remain outstanding at maturity, the aggregate principal amount would equal approximately $10.2 million. Based on the current cash balance and projected net uses of cash in the future, it is highly unlikely that the Company would be able to repay the aggregate principal amount at maturity in cash without securing additional capital or other financing. Such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Any additional equity financing, or the repayment of the Notes by issuing shares of common stock, may be dilutive to the ownership interests of existing stockholders and may adversely affect the market for and the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock, and other forms of financing could increase the Company\u2019s debt balance and result in significant expense to the Company.\nOur level of indebtedness may limit our financial flexibility.\nThe Company\u2019s indebtedness may affect its operations in several ways, including:\n\u25cf\nThe Company may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to similar companies that have less debt;\n\u25cf\nThe Notes limit the Company\u2019s ability to incur senior secured debt in excess of 18.6% of the Company\u2019s trailing 12-month revenues; and\n\u25cf\nAdditional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes may have higher costs and contain restrictive covenants or may not be available to us.\nThese factors and other factors that could affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing, some of which may be beyond the Company\u2019s control, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to take advantage of strategic opportunities that might otherwise benefit the Company, and could make the Company less attractive to potential acquirers.\nThe Notes contain a \u201cmake whole\u201d provision that provides for the PIK Notes to accelerate and be paid through maturity upon a change in control of the Company, which would increase the cost of acquiring the Company and which could, in turn, make the Company less attractive to potential acquirers.\nThe Notes provide for an acceleration of interest through maturity upon a change in control, which will have the effect of increasing the cost to a third party of acquiring the Company. This could make the Company less attractive to potential acquirers or decrease the amount that a potential acquirer would be willing to pay for shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, potentially preventing, or decreasing the consideration payable to the Company\u2019s stockholders in, a change of control transaction.", "PERMNO": 14441, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "SHSP"}
