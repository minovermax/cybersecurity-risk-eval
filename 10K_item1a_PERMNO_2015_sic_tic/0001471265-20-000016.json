{"cik": "1471265", "company": "Northwest Bancshares, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to factors discussed in the description of our business and elsewhere in this report, the following are factors that could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition.\nA worsening of economic conditions in our market area could reduce demand for our products and services and/or result in increases in our level of non-performing loans, which could adversely affect our operations, financial condition and earnings.\nOur performance is significantly impacted by the general economic conditions in our primary markets in Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio. At December 31, 2019, 49.6% of our loan portfolio was secured by properties located in Pennsylvania, with a large portion of the rest of our loans secured by real estate located in New York and Ohio. Local economic conditions have a significant impact on the ability of our borrowers to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing loans.\nA deterioration in economic conditions could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations:\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and services may decline;\n\u2022\nloan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022\ncollateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, in turn reducing customers\u2019 future borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans; and\n\u2022\nthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us.\nIn addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nChanges in laws and regulations and the cost of compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and our income.\nThe Company and Northwest Bank are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board, the Department of Banking and the FDIC. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on Northwest Bank\u2019s operations, reclassify assets, determine the adequacy of Northwest Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses and determine the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed. The laws and regulations applicable to us are subject to frequent change and interpretations. Any change in these regulations and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, new regulations or legislation or additional deposit insurance premiums could have a material impact on our operations.\nThe potential exists for additional federal or state laws and regulations, or changes in policy, affecting lending and funding practices and liquidity standards. Moreover, bank regulatory agencies have been active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, and have issued many formal enforcement orders requiring capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements. Bank regulatory agencies, such as the Federal Reserve Board, the Department of Banking, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the FDIC, govern the activities in which we may engage, primarily for the protection of depositors, and not for the protection or benefit of potential investors. In addition, new laws and regulations may increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business, and otherwise affect our operations. New laws and regulations may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our loans and investments, the fees we can charge and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability.\nThe corporate governance provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws, and the corporate governance provisions under Maryland law, may prevent or impede the holders of our common stock from obtaining representation on our Board of Directors and may impede takeovers of the Company that our board might conclude are not in the best interest of us or our stockholders.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws may prevent or impede holders of our common stock from obtaining representation on our Board of Directors and may make takeovers of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. more difficult. As a result, our stockholders may not have the opportunity to participate in such a transaction, which could provide a premium over the prevailing price of our common stock. The provisions that may discourage takeover attempts or make them more difficult include that our Board of Directors is divided into three staggered classes. A classified board makes it more difficult for stockholders to change a majority of the\ndirectors because it generally takes at least two annual elections of directors for this to occur. Our articles of incorporation include a provision that no person will be entitled to vote any shares of our common stock in excess of 10% of our outstanding shares of common stock. This limitation does not apply to the purchase of shares by a tax-qualified employee stock benefit plan established by us. In addition, our articles of incorporation and bylaws restrict who may call special meetings of stockholders and how directors may be removed from office. Additionally, in certain instances, the Maryland General Corporation Law requires a supermajority vote of our stockholders to approve a merger or other business combination with a large stockholder, if the proposed transaction is not approved by a majority of our directors.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile we strive to control the impact of changes in interest rates on our net income, our results of operations and financial condition could be significantly affected by changes in interest rates. Our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits, borrowings and trust preferred securities. Because it is difficult to perfectly match the maturities and cash flows from our financial assets and liabilities our net income could be adversely impacted by changes in the level of interest rates or the slope of the Treasury yield curve.\nChanges in interest rates may also affect the average life of loans and mortgage-related securities. Decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce their borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on existing loans and investment securities. Additionally, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans. Also, increases in interest rates may extend the life of fixed rate assets, which would restrict our ability to reinvest in higher yielding alternatives, and may result in customers withdrawing certificates of deposit early so long as the early withdrawal penalty is less than the interest they could receive as a result of the higher interest rates.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the current fair value of our interest-earning investment securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2019, the fair value of our investment and mortgage-backed securities portfolio totaled $838.1 million. Net unrealized losses on these securities totaled $4.6 million at December 31, 2019.\nAny increase in market interest rates may reduce our mortgage banking income. We generate revenues primarily from gains on the sale of mortgage loans to investors, and from the amortization of deferred mortgage servicing rights. We recognized noninterest income of $3.8 million on mortgage banking activities during the year ended December 31, 2019. We also earn interest on loans held for sale while awaiting delivery to our investors. In a rising or higher interest rate environment, our mortgage loan originations may decrease, resulting in fewer loans that are available for sale. This would result in a decrease in interest income and a decrease in revenues from loan sales. In addition, our results of operations are affected by the amount of noninterest expense associated with mortgage banking activities, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, equipment, data processing and other operating costs. During periods of reduced loan demand, our results of operations may be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to reduce expenses commensurate with the decline in mortgage loan origination activity.\nAt December 31, 2019, our interest rate risk analysis indicated that the market value of our equity would decrease by 6.3% if there was an instant parallel 200 basis point increase in market interest rates. See \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nWe are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nWe are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. A key component of our business strategy is to rely on our reputation for customer service and knowledge of local markets to expand our presence by capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in our current market and contiguous areas. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or otherwise, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.\nIf the allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.\nOur customers may not repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral, if any, securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. We may experience significant loan losses, which may have a material\nadverse effect on operating results. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease net income.\nOur emphasis on originating commercial real estate and commercial loans is one of the more significant factors in evaluating the allowance for loan losses. As we continue to increase the amount of such loans, increased provisions for loan losses may be necessary, which would decrease our earnings.\nThe FASB has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for our first fiscal year after December 15, 2019. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss (\"CECL\"), will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which will require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and to greatly increase the types of data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. We are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our results of operations and financial position.\nManagement has created a formal working group to govern the implementation of these amendments, consisting of key stakeholders from finance, risk, credit and accounting. The working group meets periodically to discuss the progress of implementation, monitor the established timeline and discuss latest hot topics and industry trends. We have engaged a third party to assist in the development of certain portfolio-level estimation methodologies and have chosen, and are in the process of implementing, a third-party software platform provider and have completed a preliminary current expected credit loss estimation. This estimation includes the quantitative and qualitative components of the calculation which incorporates a forecasting component of certain economic variables. We are currently working to finalize our documentation around the CECL methodology and designing and updating processes, internal controls and financial statement disclosures. The CECL model was also reviewed and validated by an independent consultant during the fourth quarter of 2019 and recommendations will be reviewed and implemented prior to adoption. While the impact of the ASU 2016-13 will depend upon the state of the economy and the nature of our portfolios, among other items at the date of adoption, we currently expect the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will result in a combined 15% to 35% increase in our allowance for loan losses and our reserves for unfunded commitments with a cumulative effect adjustment, net of deferred taxes, to equity. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a significant impact on our regulatory capital ratios.\nBank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase to the provision for loan losses or further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur commercial loan portfolio is increasing and the inherently higher risk of loss may lead to additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs, which would negatively impact earnings and capital.\nCommercial loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the business and the income stream of the borrowers. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Also, many of our commercial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. Commercial business loans expose us to additional risk since they typically are dependent on the borrower\u2019s ability to make repayments from the cash flows of the business and are secured by non-real estate collateral that may depreciate over time. Further, our commercial business loans may be secured by collateral other than real estate, such as inventory and accounts receivable, the value of which may be more difficult to appraise, control or collect and may be more susceptible to fluctuation in value at the time of default.\nWe could record future losses on our investment securities portfolio.\nA number of factors or combinations of factors could require us to conclude in one or more future reporting periods that an unrealized loss that exists with respect to these and other securities constitutes an impairment that is other-than-temporary, which could result in material losses to us. These factors include, but are not limited to, failure by the issuer to make scheduled interest payments, an increase in the severity of the unrealized loss on a particular security, an increase in the continuous duration of the unrealized loss without an improvement in value or changes in market conditions and/or industry or issuer specific factors that would render us unable to forecast a full recovery in value. In addition, the fair values of securities could decline if the overall economy and the financial condition of some of the issuers deteriorates and there remains limited liquidity for these securities.\nSee \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Balance Sheet Analysis-Securities\u201d for a discussion of our securities portfolio and the unrealized losses related to the portfolio, as well as the \u201cMarketable Securities\u201d and \u201cDisclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments\u201d footnotes to the audited financial statements.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions.\nThe USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions or affect our ability to pursue further acquisition opportunities. During the last year, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, these policies and procedures may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity and restrictions on expansion. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Federal Reserve Board may require us to commit capital resources to support Northwest Bank.\nFederal law requires that a holding company act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the \u201csource of strength\u201d doctrine, the Federal Reserve Board may require a holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to a subsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times when the holding company may not have the resources to provide it and therefore may be required to borrow the funds or raise capital. Any loans by a holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the institution\u2019s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the Company to make a required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our intangible assets, including goodwill, are either partially or fully impaired in the future, it would decrease earnings.\nWe are required to test our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and more regularly if indicators of impairment exist. The impairment testing process considers a variety of factors, including the current market price of our common stock, the estimated net present value of our assets and liabilities and information concerning the terminal valuation of similar insured depository institutions. Future impairment testing may result in a partial or full impairment of the value of our goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets, or both. If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and the book value of these intangible assets will be reduced by the amount of the impairment. However, the recording of such an impairment loss would have no impact on the tangible book value of our shares of common stock or our regulatory capital levels.\nStrong competition may limit growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. We compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, fintech companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these competitors (whether regional or national institutions) have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, some have competitive advantages such as the credit union exemption from paying Federal income tax. Our profitability depends upon our ability to successfully compete in our market areas.\nFuture legislative or regulatory actions responding to perceived financial and market problems could impair our ability to foreclose on collateral.\nThere have been proposals made by members of Congress and others that would reduce the amount distressed borrowers are otherwise contractually obligated to pay under their mortgage loans and limit an institution\u2019s ability to foreclose on mortgage collateral. Were proposals such as these, or other proposals limiting our rights as a creditor, to be implemented, we could experience increased credit losses or increased expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor.\nLegal and regulatory proceedings and related matters could adversely affect us or the financial services industry in general.\nWe, and other participants in the financial services industry upon whom we rely to operate, have been and may in the future become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings. Most of the proceedings we consider to be in the normal course of our business are typical for the industry; however, it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and other participants in the financial services industry or we may not prevail in any proceeding or litigation. There could be substantial cost and management diversion in such litigation and proceedings, and any adverse determination could have a materially adverse effect on our business, brand or image, or our financial condition and results of our operations.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve Board. An important function of the Federal Reserve Board is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives are open market purchases and sales of U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in banks\u2019 reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of financial institutions in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nThe level of our commercial real estate loan portfolio may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny.\nThe FDIC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies have promulgated joint guidance on sound risk management practices for financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending. Under the guidance, a financial institution that, like us, is actively involved in commercial real estate lending should perform a risk assessment to identify concentrations. A financial institution may have a concentration in commercial real estate lending if, among other factors, (i) total reported loans for construction, land acquisition and development, and other land represent 100% or more of total capital, or (ii) total reported loans secured by multi-family and non-farm residential properties, loans for construction, land acquisition and development and other land, and loans otherwise sensitive to the general commercial real estate market, including loans to commercial real estate related entities, represent 300% or more of total capital. Based on these factors, we have a concentration in multi-family and commercial real estate lending, as such loans represent 516.9% of total bank capital as of December 31, 2019. The particular focus of the guidance is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be at greater risk to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The purpose of the guidance is to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The guidance states that management should employ heightened risk management practices including board and management oversight and strategic planning, development of underwriting standards, risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing. While we believe we have implemented policies and procedures with respect to our commercial real estate loan portfolio consistent with this guidance, bank regulators could require us to implement additional policies and procedures consistent with their interpretation of the guidance that may result in additional costs to us or that may result in a curtailment of our multi-family and commercial real estate lending that would adversely affect our loan originations and profitability.\nOur exposure to municipalities may lead to operating losses.\nOur municipal bond portfolio may be impacted by the effects of economic stress on state and local governments. At December 31, 2019, we had $26.0 million invested in debt obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions (collectively referred to as our municipal bond portfolio). We also had $175.7 million of loans outstanding to municipalities and political subdivisions. Widespread concern currently exists regarding the stress on state and local governments emanating from: (i) declining revenues; (ii) large unfunded liabilities to government workers; and (iii) entrenched cost structures. Debt-to-gross domestic product ratios for the majority of states have been deteriorating due to, among other factors, declines in federal monetary assistance provided as the United States is currently experiencing the largest deficit in its history. This concern has led to speculation about the potential for a significant deterioration in the municipal bond market, which could materially affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We may not be able to mitigate the exposure in our municipal portfolio if state and local governments are unable to fulfill their obligations. The risk of widespread\nissuer defaults may also increase if there are changes in legislation that permit states, or additional municipalities and political subdivisions, to file for bankruptcy protection or if there are judicial interpretations that, in a bankruptcy or other proceeding, lessen the value of any structural protections.\nIf our government banking deposits were lost within a short period of time, this could negatively impact our liquidity and earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we held $455.8 million of deposits from municipalities throughout Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio. These deposits may be more volatile than other deposits. If a significant amount of these deposits were withdrawn within a short period of time, it could have a negative impact on our short-term liquidity and have an adverse impact on our earnings.\nThe financial services sector represents a significant concentration within our investment portfolio.\nWithin our investment portfolio, we have a significant amount of corporate debt and mortgage-backed securities issued by companies in the financial services sector. Given current market conditions, this sector has an enhanced level of credit risk.\nRisks associated with system failures, interruptions, or breaches of security could negatively affect our earnings.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition, any compromise of our systems could deter customers from using our products and services. Although we rely on security systems to provide security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of security.\nOur business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which, among other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on our ability to share nonpublic personal information about our customers with nonaffiliated third parties; (ii) requires that we provide certain disclosures to customers about our information collection, sharing and security practices and afford customers the right to \u201copt out\u201d of any information sharing by us with nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions); and (iii) requires that we develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing appropriate safeguards based on our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities, and the sensitivity of customer information we process, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Ensuring that our collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information complies with all applicable laws and regulations can increase our costs. Despite the defensive measures we take to manage our internal technological and operational infrastructure, threats may originate externally from third parties such as foreign governments, organized crime and other hackers, and outsource or infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or may originate internally from within our organization. Furthermore, we may not be able to ensure that all of our clients, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information that they exchange with us, particularly where such information is transmitted by electronic means.\nIn addition, we outsource a significant amount of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any system failures, interruption, or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for significant losses.\nOur risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss to us. We seek to identify, measure, monitor, report and control our exposure to risk, including strategic, market, liquidity, credit, interest rate, compliance and operational risks. While we use a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques, these techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks. Recent economic conditions and heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry, among other developments, have increased our level of risk. Accordingly, we could suffer losses as a result of our failure to properly anticipate and manage these risks.\nOur business may be adversely affected by an increasing prevalence of fraud and other financial crimes.\nOur loans to businesses and individuals and our deposit relationships and related transactions are subject to exposure to the risk of loss due to fraud and other financial crimes. Nationally, reported incidents of fraud and other financial crimes have increased. We have also experienced losses due to apparent fraud and other financial crimes. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent such losses, losses may still occur.\nAcquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute stockholder value.\nWe regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities with other financial institutions and financial services companies. As a result, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt, or equity securities may occur at any time. We would seek acquisition partners that offer us either significant market presence or the potential to expand our market footprint and improve profitability through economies of scale or expanded services.\nAcquiring other banks, businesses, or branches may have an adverse effect on our financial results and may involve various other risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022\ndifficulty in estimating the value of the target company;\n\u2022\npayment of a premium over book and market values that may dilute our tangible book value and earnings per share in the short and long term;\n\u2022\npotential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company;\n\u2022\nexposure to potential asset quality problems of the target company;\n\u2022\npotential volatility in reported income associated with goodwill impairment losses;\n\u2022\ndifficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company;\n\u2022\ninability to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits of the acquisition;\n\u2022\npotential disruption to our business;\n\u2022\npotential diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention;\n\u2022\nthe possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company; and\n\u2022\npotential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company.\nAcquisitions may not enhance our cash flows, business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects as expected and such acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, particularly during periods in which the acquisitions are being integrated into our operations.\nOur continued pace of growth may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed.\nWe are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. We anticipate that we will have sufficient capital resources to satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future. We may at some point, however, need to raise additional capital to support our continued growth. If we raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other securities, it would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders and may dilute the per share book value of our common stock. New investors may also have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our current stockholders, which may adversely impact our current stockholders. Also, the need to raise additional capital may force our management to spend more time in managerial and financing-related activities than in operational activities.\nOur ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we may not be able to raise additional capital, if needed, with favorable terms. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. In addition, we will continue to make investments in research, development, and marketing for new products and services. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the development and introduction of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. Furthermore, if customers do not perceive our new offerings as providing significant value, they may fail to accept our new products and services. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, the burden on management and our information technology of introducing any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage\nthese risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProvisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that are applicable to savings banks and their holding companies with $10 billion or more in assets may decrease our fee income and increase our operating costs or otherwise have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act resulted in several new requirements for banking institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. As of December 31, 2019, we had consolidated assets of $10.494 billion. These provisions, subject to a phase-in period, may significantly increase our compliance or operating costs or otherwise have a significant impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such provisions include:\n\u2022\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the \u201cCFPB\u201d), which has broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks, including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. Currently, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and the FDIC examine Northwest Bank for compliance with consumer protection laws. However, the CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets, and accordingly will assume examination and enforcement authority over us, subject to a phase in period.\n\u2022\nInterchange fees for electronic debt transactions by a payment card issuer would be limited to $0.21 plus five basis points times the value of the transaction, plus up to $0.01 for fraud prevention costs. This would lower significantly our interchange or \u201cswipe\u201d revenue. We estimate this decrease in interchange fee income to be approximately $8.0 million, before tax for the year end December 31, 2020.\n\u2022\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established 1.35% as the minimum Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio and the FDIC has adopted a plan under which it will meet the statutory minimum fund reserve ratio of 1.35% by September 30, 2020. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to offset the effect of the increase in the statutory minimum fund reserve ratio to 1.35% from the former statutory minimum of 1.15% on institutions with assets less than $10 billion. We will not be entitled to benefit from the offset.\n\u2022\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires a publicly traded savings and loan holding company with $10 billion or more in assets to establish and maintain a risk committee responsible for oversight of enterprise-wide risk management practices, which must be commensurate with the bank\u2019s structure, risk profile, complexity, activities and size.\nIt is difficult to predict the overall compliance cost of these provisions. However, compliance with these provisions would likely require additional staffing, engagement of external consultants and other operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business strategy includes growth, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.\nOur business strategy includes growth in assets, deposits and the scale of our operations. Achieving our growth targets will require us to attract customers that currently bank at other financial institutions in our market, thereby increasing our share of the market. Our ability to successfully grow will depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to attract and retain experienced bankers, the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, the competitive responses from other financial institutions in our market area and our ability to manage our growth. Growth opportunities may not be available or we may not be able to manage our growth successfully. If we do not manage our growth effectively, our financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected.\nUncertainties associated with increased loan originations may result in errors in our judgment of collectability, which may lead to additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs, which would negatively affect our operations.\nIncreasing loan originations would likely require us to lend to borrowers with which we have limited experience. Accordingly, we would not have a significant payment history pattern with which to judge future collectability. Further, newly originated loans have not been subjected to unfavorable economic conditions. As a result, it may be difficult to predict the future performance of newly originated loans. These loans may have delinquency or charge-off levels above our recent historical experience, which could adversely affect our future performance.\nOur funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits at maturity and support our future growth.\nWe must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. As a part of our liquidity management, we use a number of funding sources in addition to core deposit growth and repayments and maturities of loans and investments. As we continue to grow, we are likely to become more dependent on these sources, which may include Federal Home Loan Bank advances, proceeds from the sale of loans, federal funds purchased and brokered certificates of deposit. Adverse operating results or changes in industry conditions could lead to difficulty or an inability to access these additional funding sources. Our financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates. If we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In this case, our operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected.\nChanges in card network rules or standards could adversely affect our business.\nIn order to provide our debit card and cash management solutions, we are members of the Visa network. As such, we are subject to card network rules that could subject us to a variety of fines or penalties that may be assessed on us. The termination of our membership or any changes in card network rules or standards, including interpretation and implementation of existing rules or standards, could increase the cost of operating our merchant services business or limit our ability to provide debit card and cash management solutions to or through our customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in card network fees could impact our operations.\nFrom time to time, the card networks increase the fees (known as interchange fees) that they charge to acquirers and that we charge to our merchants. It is possible that competitive pressures will result in us absorbing a portion of such increases in the future, which would increase our costs, reduce our profit margin and adversely affect our business and financial condition. In addition, the card networks require certain capital requirements. An increase in the required capital level would further limit our use of capital for other purposes.\nOur business could suffer if there is a decline in the use of debit cards as a payment mechanism or if there are adverse developments with respect to the financial services industry in general.\nAs the financial services industry evolves, consumers may find debit financial services to be less attractive than traditional or other financial services. Consumers might not use debit card financial services for any number of reasons, including the general perception of our industry. If consumers do not continue or increase their usage of debit cards, including making changes in the way debit cards are loaded, our operating revenues and debit card deposits may remain at current levels or decline. Any projected growth for the industry may not occur or may occur more slowly than estimated. If consumer acceptance of debit financial services does not continue to develop or develops more slowly than expected or if there is a shift in the mix of payment forms, such as cash, credit cards, and debit cards, away from our products and services, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nChanges in management\u2019s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements and our financial condition or operating results.\nIn preparing this annual report as well as periodic reports we are required to file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including our Consolidated Financial Statements, our management is and will be required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on management\u2019s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include our valuation of investment securities, our determination of our income tax provision and goodwill, and our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses.\nWe could be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions and other third parties we rely on.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional customers. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when our collateral cannot be foreclosed upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due. Furthermore, successful operation of our debit card and cash management solutions business depends on the soundness of third party processors, clearing agents and others that we rely on to conduct our merchant business. Any losses resulting from such third parties could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and we could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to one or more of these properties. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing defaulted loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous conditions or toxic substances are found on these properties, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage, civil fines and criminal penalties regardless of when the hazardous conditions or toxic substances first affected any particular property. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses to address unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on nonresidential real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are required to transition from the use of the LIBOR interest rate index in the future.\nWe have certain loans indexed to LIBOR to calculate the loan interest rate. The continued availability of the LIBOR index is not guaranteed after 2021. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR. The implementation of a substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our borrowers may incur significant expenses in effecting the transition, may result in reduced loan balances if borrowers do not accept the substitute index or indices, and may result in disputes or litigation with customers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute index or indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nA protracted government shutdown may result in reduced loan originations and related gains on sale and could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring any protracted federal government shutdown, we may not be able to close certain loans and we may not be able to recognize non-interest income on the sale of loans. Some of the loans we originate are sold directly to government agencies, and some of these sales may be unable to be consummated during the shutdown. In addition, we believe that some borrowers may determine not to proceed with their home purchase and not close on their loans, which would result in a permanent loss of the related non-interest income. A federal government shutdown could also result in reduced income for government employees or employees of companies that engage in business with the federal government, which could result in greater loan delinquencies, increases in our nonperforming, criticized and classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services.", "PERMNO": 81095, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "NWBI"}
