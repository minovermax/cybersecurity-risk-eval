{"cik": "730349", "company": "TOFUTTI BRANDS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-04-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\tRisk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before investing in our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the value of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may not be able to attain profitability in the future. To the extent that we continue to incur operating losses, we may not have sufficient working capital to fund our operations in the future.\nOur sales have not rebounded since the loss in 2011 of our then largest customer, when it discontinued stocking branded goods. We continue to struggle to replace those sales. The loss of revenues from this former customer has affected our profitability. We had net losses of $163,000 in the year ended December 27, 2014 and $643,000 in the year ended January 2, 2016. If we are unable to increase revenues, we may not be able to return to or sustain profitable operations in the future or generate positive cash flows from our operations.\nAs of January 2, 2016, we had $55,000 in cash and cash equivalents and our working capital was $2,003,000. The lack of sufficient working capital could negatively impact our ability to introduce and adequately promote new products. To the extent that we incur operating losses in the future or are unable to generate free cash flows from our business, we may not have sufficient working capital to fund our operations and will be required to obtain additional financing. Such financing may not be available, or, if available, may not be on terms satisfactory to us. If adequate funds are not available to us, our business, and results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nWe are indebted to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer pursuant to a promissory note which is secured by substantially all of our assets. Any failure to meet our obligations under the note could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn January 6, 2016, we received a $500,000 loan from Mr. David Mintz, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the company. The loan, which expires on December 31, 2017, bears interest at 5% per annum and may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty. The loan is secured by substantially all of our assets and is convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $4.01 per share.\nIn the event we are unable to repay the loan, or if there is an event of default, without any action on the part of Mr. Mintz, the interest rate will increase to 12% per annum and the entire principal and interest balance under the loan, and all of our other obligations under the loan, will be immediately due and payable, and Mr. Mintz will be entitled to seek and institute any and all remedies available to him. Any failure to meet our obligations under the note could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on a few key distributors for a significant portion of our sales.\nA significant portion of our sales are to several key distributors, which are large distribution companies with numerous divisions and subsidiaries who act independently. Such distributors as a group accounted for 44% of our net sales in the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016 and 43% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2014. Although we believe that the business associated with any of our primary distributors can be readily transferred to other distributors or directly to supermarket warehouses if necessary, no assurance can be given that a change in distributors would not be disruptive to our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe depend on several key suppliers to produce our products.\nWe do not produce any of our own products. During the years ended January 2, 2016 and December 27, 2014, we purchased approximately 24% and 26%, respectively, of our finished goods from Ice Cream Specialties, our frozen dessert novelty co-packer, and 29% and 28% of our finished goods, respectively, from Franklin Foods, our BETTER THAN CREAM CHEESE, SOUR SUPREME, and BETTER THAN RICOTTA co-packer. Although we believe that there will be no problem in continuing to obtain finished goods from our current or alternative sources in the future, any disruption in supply could have a material adverse effect on our company.\nOur suppliers are subject to federal, state and local government regulations that could adversely affect our business and financial position.\nVirtually all food manufacturing operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local government entities and agencies. As producers of food products for human consumption, our suppliers are subject to stringent production, packaging, quality, labeling and distribution standards, including regulations mandated by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the FDA, OSHA, the EPA and the USDA. Future regulation by various federal, state or local governmental entities or agencies could, among other things, increase our suppliers\u2019 cost of production, cause them to incur unexpected expenditures or encumber productivity, any of which may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive frozen dessert and health food markets may affect our operational performance and financial results.\nThe frozen dessert, non-dairy cheese food and health food markets are highly competitive. In addition, many of our principal competitors are large, diversified companies with resources significantly greater than ours. We expect strong competition to continue, including competition for adequate distribution and competition for the limited shelf space for the frozen dessert and non-dairy cheese food categories in supermarkets and other retail food outlets. Competition in our product categories is based on product innovation, product quality, price, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing, promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. Our market share and ability to grow our revenue could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing innovative products in response to changing consumer demands or by new product introductions of our competitors. If we are unable to build and sustain brand equity by offering recognizably superior product quality, we may be unable to maintain premium pricing over competitive products.\nFrom time to time, we and our customers experience price pressure in some of our markets as a result of competitors\u2019 promotional pricing practices as well as general market conditions. Our failure to match or exceed our competitors\u2019 cost reductions through innovative products and other improvements could weaken our competitive position. Competition is based on product quality, reliability, food safety, distribution effectiveness, brand loyalty, price, effective promotional activities, the ability to identify and satisfy emerging consumer preferences and the ability to provide ancillary support services. We may not be able to compete effectively with these larger, more diversified companies.\nWe rely on a limited number of key executives to manage our business.\nOur success is significantly dependent on the services of David Mintz (age 84), Chief Executive Officer, and Steven Kass (age 64), Chief Financial Officer. The loss of the services of either of these persons could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nA material change in consumer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business.\nWe are a consumer food products company and rely on continued demand for our products. To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to consumers. If demand and growth rates fall substantially below expected levels or our market share declines significantly in these businesses, our results could be negatively impacted. This could occur due to unforeseen negative economic or political events or to changes in consumer trends and habits.\nOur operating costs are subject to fluctuations which could affect our business results.\nThe principal raw materials that we use are commodities that experience price volatility caused by external conditions such as weather, product scarcity, limited sources of supply, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. Commodity price changes may result in unexpected increases in raw material, packaging, and energy costs. Therefore, our success is dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions. In the manufacturing and general overhead areas, we need to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including any key sole supplier and manufacturing plant arrangements.\nEconomic downturns and disruptions in financial markets can adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur results of operations can be materially affected by adverse conditions in the financial markets and depressed economic conditions generally. Worsening economic conditions may result in diminished demand for our products and in decreased sales volumes. Recessionary environments adversely affect the demand for our products as a result of constraints on discretionary spending by our retail customers. In addition, this could result in longer sales cycles, slower acceptance of new products and increased competition for our products, which in turn could cause us to reduce prices for our products resulting in reduced gross margins. Any of these events would likely harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, the current economic climate, and particularly the increased difficulty in securing credit, could impact the ability of our customers to purchase our products. Certain of our retail customers who have seen significant dampening of consumer demand, could face increased financial pressures that could impact their ability to purchase our products and make payments in a timely manner. The continued high unemployment levels in the U.S. and the lingering effects of the global credit crisis, will impact the ability of our customers to purchase our products.\nNatural disasters, terrorist attacks or breaches of network or information technology security could have an adverse effect on our business.\nNatural disasters, cyber-attacks or other breaches of network or information technology (IT) security, terrorist acts or acts of war may cause disrupt our systems and operations. We expect that our inability to operate our facilities as a result of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses and/or loss of market share to our competitors. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe need to continue to introduce new products.\nThe successful introduction of innovative products on a periodic basis has become increasingly important to our ability to maintain and grow our sales. Accordingly, the future degree of market acceptance of any of our new products, which may be accompanied by significant promotional expenditures, is likely to have an important impact on our future financial results.\nOur operating results vary quarterly.\nWe have often recognized a slightly greater portion of revenues in the second and third quarter of the year. We expect to continue to experience slightly higher sales in the second and third quarters and slightly lower sales in the fourth and first quarters, as a result of reduced sales of non-dairy frozen desserts. In addition, sales to our major customers fluctuate widely from period to period and there is no way to accurately predict that their sales pattern from one year will be repeated in the corresponding period of the next fiscal year. Due to the foregoing factors, in some future quarter our operating results may be below the expectations of investors. In such event, it is likely that the price of our common stock would be materially adversely affected.\nWe have no registered patents. The absence of patent protection could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely upon the confidentiality of our formulas and our know-how rather than upon patent protection. There is no assurance that such confidentiality can or will be maintained or that our know-how cannot be obtained by others or that others do not now possess similar or even more effective capabilities. The failure to maintain the confidentiality of our know-how could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are subject to risks associated with international operations.\nIn fiscal 2015 approximately 17% of our revenues were from international sales. Although we continue to expand our international operations, we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products. To the extent that we cannot do so in a timely manner, our business, operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected. International operations are subject to inherent risks, including the following:\n\u25cf different and changing regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate or may operate in the future;\n\u25cf the impact of possible recessionary environments in multiple foreign markets;\n\u25cf export restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u25cf difficulties in managing and supporting foreign operations;\n\u25cf longer payment cycles;\n\u25cf difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u25cf political and economic changes, hostilities and other disruptions in regions where we currently sell or products or may sell our products in the future; and\n\u25cf seasonal reductions in business activities.\nNegative developments in any of these areas in one or more countries could result in a reduction in demand for our products, the cancellation or delay of orders already placed, difficulty in collecting receivables, and a higher cost of doing business, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nOur foreign transactions are always in U.S. dollars, and to date we have not engaged in any currency hedging transactions intended to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations. Therefore, our future export sales could be adversely affected by an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar, which could increase the local currency price of our products. Although exposure to currency fluctuations to date has not had a material effect on our business, there can be no assurance such fluctuations in the future will not materially and adversely affect our revenues from international sales and, consequently, our business, operating results and financial condition.\nProduct liability suits, if brought, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFrom time to time in the normal course of our business, we become subject to product liability claims. If a product liability claim exceeding our insurance coverage were to be successfully asserted against us, it could harm our business. We cannot assure you that such coverage will be sufficient to insure against claims which may be brought against us, or that we will be able to maintain such insurance or obtain additional insurance covering existing or new products. As a marketer of food products, we are subject to the risk of claims for product liability. We maintain general product liability and umbrella insurance coverage and generally require that our co-packers maintain product liability insurance with us as a co-insured. Similarly, most of our customers require us to name them as additional insureds as well, and in some cases we are required to sign hold harmless and indemnification agreements.\nIf our food products become adulterated or misbranded, we would need to recall those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured as a result.\nFood products occasionally contain contaminants due to inherent defects or improper storage or handling. Under adverse circumstances, food producers may be required to recall some of their products if they become adulterated or misbranded or as a result of a government-mandated recall. The scope of such a recall could result in significant costs incurred as a result of the recall, potential destruction of inventory, and lost sales. Should consumption of any product cause injury, we may be liable for monetary damages as a result of a settlement or judgment against us. A widespread product recall could result in changes to one or more of our business processes, product shortages, a loss of customer confidence in our brand or other adverse effects on our business.\nOur failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have an adverse effect on our financial results and the market price of our common stock.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposes certain duties on us and our executives and directors. Our efforts to comply with the requirements of Section 404 have resulted in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management time and attention, and we expect these efforts to require the continued commitment of resources. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to provide management\u2019s annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for each fiscal year. Based on their evaluation under the frameworks described above, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of January 2, 2016 because of the following material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting:\n\u25cf a continuing lack of sufficient resources and an insufficient level of monitoring and oversight, which may restrict our ability to gather, analyze and report information relative to the financial statements in a timely manner.\n\u25cf The limited size of the accounting department makes it impracticable to achieve an optimum separation of duties.\nOur failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could result in investigation or sanctions by regulatory authorities, and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, investor confidence in our reported financial information, and the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nWe have received a notice of non-compliance with a continued listing standard from the NYSE MKT for our common stock. If we are unable to avoid the delisting of our common stock from the NYSE MKT, it could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity and results of operations.\nOn April 1, 2015, we received a notice from the NYSE MKT LLC (the \u201cNYSE MKT\u201d) indicating that we did not meet continued listing standards of the NYSE MKT. We are not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(ii) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide (the \u201cCompany Guide\u201d) because we reported stockholders\u2019 equity of $2.6 million as of December 27, 2014 and had net losses in in three out of our four most recent fiscal years. As a result, we became subject to the procedures and requirements of Section 1009 of the Company Guide.\nWe submitted a plan of compliance to the NYSE MKT on April 28, 2015 addressing how we intend to regain compliance and on June 23, 2015, we were granted an extension until October 1, 2016 to regain compliance with the continued listing standards of the NYSE MKT. We will be subject to periodic review by the staff of NYSE Regulation, Inc. during the extension period. Failure to make progress consistent with the plan or to regain compliance with the continued listing standards by the end of the extension period could result in our being delisted from the NYSE MKT.\nIf our common stock ultimately were to be delisted for any reason, it could negatively impact us by (i) reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock; (ii) reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing; and (iii) limiting our ability to use a registration statement to offer and sell freely tradable securities, thereby preventing us from accessing the public capital markets.\nVolatility of the market price of our common stock could adversely affect our shareholders and us.\nThe market price of our common stock has been subject to fluctuations in the past and may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, including the following:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of new and enhanced products;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning proprietary rights;\n\u25cf introduction and adoption of new industry standards;\n\u25cf market conditions or trends in our industry;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions;\n\u25cf entry into strategic partnerships or joint ventures by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf political and economic conditions, such as a recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations or political events; and\n\u25cf other events or factors in any of the countries in which we do business, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters or responses to such events.\nIn addition, in recent years the stock market has been highly volatile. Many of these factors are beyond our control and may materially adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares, regardless of our performance. In the past, following periods of market volatility, shareholders have often instituted securities class action litigation relating to the stock trading and price volatility of the company in question. If we were involved in any securities litigation, it could result in substantial cost to us to defend and divert resources and the attention of management from our business.\nOur principal shareholder has the ability to control the policies and management of our company.\nOur Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, David Mintz, holds 2,630,440 shares of common stock representing approximately 51.0% of the outstanding shares. For as long as Mr. Mintz has a controlling interest in our company, he will have the ability to exercise a controlling influence over our business and affairs, including any determinations with respect to potential mergers or other business combinations involving us, our acquisition or disposition of assets, our incurrence of indebtedness, our issuance of any additional common shares or other equity securities, our repurchase or redemption of common shares and our payment of dividends. Similarly, as long as Mr. Mintz has a controlling interest in our company, he will have the power to determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, including the power to elect all of the members of our board of directors and prevent an acquisition or any other change in control of us.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends.\nOur policy is to retain earnings, if any, for use in our business and, for this reason, we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 68718, "SIC": 2024, "TIC": "TOFB"}
