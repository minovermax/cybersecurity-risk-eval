{"cik": "1175151", "company": "Cytosorbents Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to our Industry and our Business\nWe may require additional capital in the future to fund our operations\nAs of December 31, 2014 we had current assets of approximately $7,607,000 including cash on hand of approximately $3,605,000 and short-term investments of approximately $1,945,000 and current liabilities of approximately $4,505,000. On January 14, 2015, we received approximately $9,409,000 in net proceeds in connection with a registered offering of our common stock. Through December 31, 2014, our cash burn was approximately $6,400,000 for fiscal year 2014. Our current and historical cash burn is not necessarily indicative of our future use of cash and cash equivalents.\nWe may require additional financing in the future in order to complete additional clinical studies and to support the commercialization of our proposed products. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our capital raising efforts. Our long-term capital requirements are expected to depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022 continued progress and cost of our research and development programs;\n\u2022 progress with pre-clinical studies and clinical studies;\n\u2022 the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory clearance in other countries and/or for other indications;\n\u2022 costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims;\n\u2022 costs of developing sales, marketing and distribution channels;\n\u2022 market acceptance and reimbursement of our products; and\n\u2022 cost for training physicians and other health care personnel.\nShould the financing we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, the consequences could be a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition, in the event that additional funds are obtained through arrangements with collaborative partners or other sources, we may have to relinquish economic and/or proprietary rights to some of our technologies or products under development that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize by ourselves.\nWe currently are in the process of commercializing our products, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing commercial operations.\nWe have been engaged primarily in research and development activities and have generated limited revenues to date. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage the transition to a commercial enterprise. Potential investors should be aware of the problems, delays, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by an enterprise in the early stage of development, which include unanticipated problems relating to development of proposed products, testing, regulatory compliance, manufacturing, competition, market adoption, product registration, reimbursement, marketing problems and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates. Our proposed products will require significant additional research and testing, and we will need to overcome significant regulatory burdens prior to commercialization in other countries, such as the U.S., and for ongoing compliance for our CE Mark. We will also need to raise significant additional funds to complete additional clinical studies and obtain regulatory approvals in other countries before we can begin selling our products in markets not covered by the CE Mark. There can be no assurance that after the expenditure of substantial funds and efforts, we will successfully develop and commercialize any products, generate any significant revenues or ever achieve and maintain a substantial level of sales of our products.\nWe have a history of losses and expect to incur substantial future losses, and the report of our auditor on our consolidated financial statements expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have experienced substantial operating losses since inception. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $124,394,120, which included net losses of $9,321,672 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $4,677,795 for the year ended December 31, 2013. In part due to these losses, our audited consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern, and the auditors\u2019 report on those financial statements express substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in the research and development of our polymer technology and general and administrative expenses. We intend to conduct significant additional research, development, and clinical study activities which, together with expenses incurred for the establishment of manufacturing arrangements and a marketing and distribution presence and other general and administrative expenses, are expected to result in continuing operating losses for the foreseeable future. The amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve profitability are uncertain. Our ability to achieve profitability will depend, among other things, on successfully completing the development of our technology and commercial products, obtaining additional requisite regulatory approvals in markets not covered by the CE Mark and for potential label extensions of our current CE Mark, establishing manufacturing and sales and marketing arrangements with third parties, and raising sufficient funds to finance our activities. No assurance can be given that our product development efforts will be successful, that our current CE Mark will enable us to achieve profitability, that additional regulatory approvals in other countries will be obtained, that any of our products will be manufactured at a competitive cost and will be of acceptable quality, or that the we will be able to achieve profitability or that profitability, if achieved, can be sustained.\nWe depend upon key personnel who may terminate their employment with us at any time.\nAs of February 28, 2015 we currently have forty- five full-time employees and several full-time temporary employees. Our success will depend to a significant degree upon the continued services of our key management and advisors, including, Dr. Phillip Chan, our Chief Executive Officer; Kathleen P. Bloch, our Chief Financial Officer; Vincent Capponi, our Chief Operating Officer and Dr. Robert Bartlett our Chief Medical Officer, who works with us on a consulting basis. These individuals do not have long-term employment agreements, and in some cases, including with respect to Dr. Chan and Mr. Capponi, do not have current and effective employment agreements in place. Although we are discussing formalizing our employment and consulting arrangements, as applicable, with Dr. Chan, Mr. Capponi and Dr. Bartlett , there can be no assurance that Dr. Chan, Mr. Capponi, Dr. Bartlett or other members of our management team and advisors will continue to provide services to us. In addition, our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain other highly skilled personnel. We may be unable to recruit such personnel on a timely basis, if at all. Management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of services of key personnel, or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, could result in delays in development or approval of our products, loss of sales and diversion of management resources.\nOur Chief Medical Officer works with us on a consulting basis.\nOur Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Robert Bartlett, works with us on a consulting basis. Because of the part time nature of his consulting agreement, Dr. Bartlett may not always be available to provide us with his services when needed by us in a timely manner.\nAcceptance of our medical devices in the marketplace is uncertain, and failure to achieve market acceptance will prevent or delay our ability to generate revenues.\nOur future financial performance will depend, at least in part, upon the introduction and customer acceptance of our polymer products. Even with our approval to apply the CE Mark to our CytoSorb\u00ae device as a cytokine filter, our products may not achieve market acceptance in the European countries that recognize and accept the CE Mark. Additional approvals from other regulatory authorities (such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA) will be required before we can market our device in countries not covered by the CE Mark. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to achieve additional regulatory approvals, and even if we do, our products may not achieve market acceptance in the countries covered by such approvals. The degree of market acceptance will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 the receipt of regulatory clearance of marketing claims for the uses that we are developing;\n\u2022 the establishment and demonstration of the advantages, safety and efficacy of the our polymer technology;\n\u2022 pricing and reimbursement policies of government and third-party payers such as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other health plan administrators;\n\u2022 our ability to attract corporate partners, including medical device companies, to assist in commercializing our products; and\n\u2022 our ability to market our products.\nPhysicians, patients, payers or the medical community in general may be unwilling to accept, utilize or recommend any of our products. Approval of our CytoSorb\u00ae device as a cytokine filter as well as the data we have gathered in our clinical studies to support device usage in this indication may not be sufficient for market acceptance in the medical community. We may also need to conduct additional clinical studies to gather additional data for marketing purposes. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval or commercialize and market our products when planned, we may not achieve any market acceptance or generate revenue.\nEven with our approval to apply the CE Mark to our CytoSorb\u00ae device as a cytokine filter, there can be no assurance that the data from our limited clinical studies will be viewed as sufficient by the medical community to support the purchase of our products in substantial quantities or at all.\nCytoSorb\u00ae is currently reimbursable in Germany and Austria. We plan to seek reimbursement for our product in other E.U. and non-E.U. countries to help further adoption. There can be no assurance when, or if, this additional reimbursement might be approved.\nWe may face litigation from third parties claiming that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights, or seek to challenge the validity of our patents.\nOur future success is also dependent on the strength of our intellectual property, trade secrets and know-how, which have been developed from years of research and development. In addition to the \u201cPurolite\u201d litigation discussed below, we may be exposed to additional future litigation by third parties seeking to challenge the validity of our rights based on claims that our technologies, products or activities infringe the intellectual property rights of others or are invalid, or that we have misappropriated the trade secrets of others.\nSince our inception, we have sought to contract with large, established manufacturers to supply commercial quantities of our adsorbent polymers. As a result, we have disclosed, under confidentiality agreements, various aspects of our technology with potential manufacturers. We believe that these disclosures, while necessary for our business, have resulted in the attempt by potential suppliers to improperly assert ownership claims to our technology in an attempt to gain an advantage in negotiating manufacturing rights.\nWe have previously engaged in discussions with the Brotech Corporation and its affiliate, Purolite International, Inc. (collectively \u201cPurolite\u201d), which had demonstrated a strong interest in being our polymer manufacturer. For a period of time beginning in December 1998, Purolite engaged in efforts to develop and optimize the manufacturing process needed to produce our polymer products on a commercial scale. However, the parties eventually decided not to proceed. In 2003, Purolite filed a lawsuit against us asserting, among other things, co-ownership and co-inventorship of certain of our patents. On September 1, 2006, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania approved a Stipulated Order and Settlement Agreement under which we and Purolite agreed to the settlement of the action. The Settlement Agreement provides us with the exclusive right to use our patented technology and proprietary know how relating to adsorbent polymers for a period of 18 years. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, we have agreed to pay Purolite royalties of 2.5% to 5% on the sale of certain of our products if and when those products are sold commercially.\nSeveral years ago we engaged in discussions with the Dow Chemical Company, which had indicated a strong interest in being our polymer manufacturer. After a Dow representative on our Advisory Board resigned, Dow filed and received several patents naming our former Advisory Board member as an inventor. In management\u2019s view the Dow patents improperly incorporate our technology and should not have been granted to Dow. The existence of these Dow patents could result in a potential dispute with Dow in the future and additional expenses for us.\nWe have commenced the process of seeking regulatory approvals of our products, but the approval process involves lengthy and costly clinical studies and is, in large part, not in the control of the Company. The failure to obtain government approvals, internationally or domestically, for our polymer products, or to comply with ongoing governmental regulations could prevent, delay or limit introduction or sale of our products and result in the failure to achieve revenues or maintain our operations.\nCytoSorb\u00ae has already achieved European Union regulatory approval under the CE Mark and the Medical Devices Directive. It is manufactured at our manufacturing facility in New Jersey under ISO 13485 Full Quality Systems certification. The manufacturing and marketing of our products will be subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation in the European market, the United States, in various states and in other foreign countries. In the United States and other countries, the process of obtaining and maintaining required regulatory approvals is lengthy, expensive, and uncertain. There can be no assurance that we will ever obtain the necessary additional approvals to sell our products in the United States or other non E.U. countries. Even if we do ultimately receive FDA approval for any of our products, we will be subject to extensive ongoing regulation. While the Company has received approval from its Notified Body to apply the CE Mark to our CytoSorb\u00ae device, we will be subject to extensive ongoing regulation and auditing requirements to maintain the CE Mark.\nOur products will be subject to international regulation as medical devices under the Medical Devices Directive. In Europe, which we expect to provide the initial market for our products, the Notified Body and Competent Authority govern, where applicable, development, clinical studies, labeling, manufacturing, registration, notification, clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, record keeping, and reporting requirements for medical devices. Different regulatory requirements may apply to our products depending on how they are categorized by the Notified Body under these laws. Current international regulations classify our CytoSorb\u00ae device as a Class IIb device. Even though we have received CE Mark certification of the CytoSorb\u00ae device, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to comply with the required annual auditing requirements or other international regulatory requirements that may be applicable. In addition, there can be no assurance that government regulations applicable to our products or the interpretation of those regulations will not change. The extent of potentially adverse government regulation that might arise from future legislation or administrative action cannot be predicted. There can be no assurances that reimbursement will be granted or that additional clinical data may be required to establish reimbursement.\nWe have conducted limited clinical studies of our CytoSorb\u00ae device. Clinical and pre-clinical data is susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent additional regulatory clearances.\nTo date, we have conducted limited clinical studies on our CytoSorb\u00ae product. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete additional clinical studies necessary to receive additional regulatory approvals in markets not covered by the CE Mark. While studies conducted by us and others have produced results we believe to be encouraging and indicative of the potential efficacy of our products and technology, data already obtained, or in the future obtained, from pre-clinical studies and clinical studies do not necessarily predict the results that will be obtained from later pre-clinical studies and clinical studies. Moreover, pre-clinical and clinical data are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent additional regulatory approvals. A number of companies in the medical device and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical studies, even after promising results in earlier studies. The failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of an intended product under development could delay or prevent regulatory clearance of the device, resulting in delays to commercialization, and could materially harm our business. Even though we have received approval to apply the CE Mark to our CytoSorb\u00ae device as a cytokine filter, there can be no assurance that we will be able to receive approval for other potential applications of CytoSorb\u00ae, or that we will receive regulatory clearance from other targeted regions or countries.\nWe rely extensively on research and testing facilities at various universities and institutions, which could adversely affect us should we lose access to those facilities.\nAlthough we have our own research laboratories and clinical facilities, we collaborate with numerous institutions, universities and commercial entities to conduct research and studies of our products. We currently maintain a good working relationship with these parties. However, should the situation change, the cost and time to establish or locate alternative research and development could be substantial and delay gaining CE Mark for other potential applications or technologies, and/or FDA approval and commercializing our products.\nWe are and will be exposed to product liability risks, and clinical and preclinical liability risks, which could place a substantial financial burden upon us should we be sued.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical devices. We cannot be sure that claims will not be asserted against us. A successful liability claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot give assurances that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain adequate product liability insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, or that such insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Claims or losses in excess of any product liability insurance coverage that we may obtain could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain university and other relationships are important to our business and may potentially result in conflicts of interests.\nDr. John Kellum and others, are critical care advisors and consultants of ours and are associated with institutions such as the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Their association with these institutions may currently or in the future involve conflicting interests in the event they or these institutions enter into consulting or other arrangements with competitors of ours.\nWe have limited manufacturing experience, and once our products are approved, we may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities at an acceptable cost, or without shut-downs or delays.\nIn March, 2011 we received approval from our Notified Body to apply the CE Mark to our CytoSorb\u00ae device for commercial sale as a cytokine filter. CytoSorbents also achieved ISO 13485:2003 Full Quality Systems certification, an internationally recognized quality standard designed to ensure that medical device manufacturers have the necessary comprehensive management systems in place to safely design, develop, manufacture and distribute medical devices in the European Union. CytoSorbents manufactures CytoSorb\u00ae at its manufacturing facilities in New Jersey for sale in the E.U. and for additional clinical studies. We will need to maintain compliance on an ongoing basis. We have limited experience in establishing, supervising and conducting commercial manufacturing. If we or the third-party manufacturers of our products fail to adequately establish, supervise and conduct all aspects of the manufacturing processes, we may not be able to commercialize our products.\nWhile we currently believe we have established sufficient production capacity to supply potential near term demand for the CytoSorb\u00ae device, we will need to scale up and increase our manufacturing capabilities in the future. No assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully scale up our manufacturing capabilities or that we will have sufficient financial or technical resources to do so on a timely basis or at all.\nDue to our limited marketing, sales and distribution experience, we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to sell our products.\nWe expect to enter into agreements with third parties for the commercial marketing, and distribution of our products. There can be no assurance that parties we may engage to market and distribute our products will:\n\u2022 satisfy their financial or contractual obligations to us;\n\u2022 adequately market our products; or\n\u2022 not offer, design, manufacture or promote competing products.\nIf for any reason any party we engage is unable or chooses not to perform its obligations under our marketing and distribution agreement, we would experience delays in product sales and incur increased costs, which would harm our business and financial results.\nOur results of operations can be significantly affected by foreign currency fluctuations and regulations.\nA significant portion of our revenues is currently derived in the local currencies of the foreign jurisdictions in which our products are sold. Accordingly, we are subject to risks relating to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In the future, and especially as we further expand our sales efforts in international markets, our customers will increasingly make payments in non-U.S. currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our revenues, operating costs and operating margins. In addition, currency devaluation can result in a loss to us if we hold deposits of that currency. We cannot predict the effect of future exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results.\nIf we are unable to convince physicians and other health care providers as to the benefits of our products, we may incur delays or additional expense in our attempt to establish market acceptance.\nBroad use of our products may require physicians and other health care providers to be informed about our products and their intended benefits. The time and cost of such an educational process may be substantial. Inability to successfully carry out this education process may adversely affect market acceptance of our products. We may be unable to educate physicians regarding our products in sufficient numbers or in a timely manner to achieve our marketing plans or to achieve product acceptance. Any delay in physician education may materially delay or reduce demand for our products. In addition, we may expend significant funds towards physician education before any acceptance or demand for our products is created, if at all.\nThe market for our products is rapidly changing and competitive, and new devices and drugs, which may be developed by others, could impair our ability to maintain and grow our business and remain competitive.\nThe medical device and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid and substantial technological change. Developments by others may render our technologies and products noncompetitive or obsolete. We also may be unable to keep pace with technological developments and other market factors. Technological competition from medical device, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and others diversifying into the field is intense and is expected to increase. Many of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities and budgets than we do, as well as substantially more marketing, manufacturing, financial and managerial resources. These entities represent significant competition for us.\nIf users of our products are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payers, or if new restrictive legislation is adopted, market acceptance of our products may be limited and we may not achieve anticipated revenues.\nThe continuing efforts of government and insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other payers of healthcare costs to contain or reduce costs of health care may affect our future revenues and profitability, and the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers, suppliers and collaborative partners and the availability of capital. For example, in certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of medical devices is subject to government control. In the United States, given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on health care reform, the cost of medical devices and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid systems. While we cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to commercialize our products will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of our products and related treatment are obtained by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, such as health maintenance organizations (\u201cHMOs\u201d). Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical care. Also, the trend toward managed health care in the United States and the concurrent growth of organizations such as HMOs, which could control or significantly influence the purchase of health care services and medical devices, as well as legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government insurance programs, may all result in lower prices for our products. The cost containment measures that health care payers and providers are instituting and the effect of any health care reform could materially harm our ability to operate profitably.\nCytoSorb\u00ae is currently reimbursable in Germany and Austria. We plan to seek reimbursement for our product in other E.U. and non-E.U. countries to help further adoption. There can be no assurance when, or if, this additional reimbursement might be approved.\nRisks Connected to our Securities\nThe price of our Common Stock has been highly volatile due to factors that will continue to affect the price of our stock.\nOur Common Stock closed as high as $8.75 and as low as $3.00 per share between January 1, 2014 and December 2, 2014 on the OTCQB. On December 3, 2014, we effected a twenty-five-for-one (25:1) reverse split of our common stock. Immediately after the reverse stock split, on December 3, 2014 we changed our state of incorporation from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 3, 2014, whereby we merged with and into our recently formed, wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary. On December 17, 2014, CytoSorbents received approval for up-listing to The NASDAQ Capital Market and its common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market on December 23, 2014. On March 9, 2015 the closing price of our common stock, as reported on the NASDAQ Capital Market was $11.68. Historically, the over-the-counter markets for securities such as our Common Stock have experienced extreme price fluctuations. Some of the factors leading to this volatility include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022 announcements of product releases by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 announcements of acquisitions and/or partnerships by us or our competitors; and\n\u2022 general market conditions.\nAlthough share of our common stock currently trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol \u201cCTSO\u201d, there is no assurance that our stock will not continue to be volatile while listed on NASDAQ in the future.\nDirectors, executive officers and principal stockholders own a significant percentage of the shares of Common Stock, which will limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur directors, executive officers and principal stockholders together beneficially own a significant percentage of the voting control of the Common Stock on a fully diluted basis. Accordingly, these stockholders could have a significant influence over the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to stockholders for approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and also could prevent or cause a change in control. The interests of these stockholders may differ from the interests of our other stockholders. Third parties may be discouraged from making a tender offer or bid to acquire us because of this concentration of ownership.\nOur Board of Directors may, without stockholder approval, issue and fix the terms of shares of preferred stock and issue additional shares of common stock adversely affecting the rights of holders of our common stock.\nOn December 3, 2014, we effected a twenty-five-for-one (25:1) reverse split of our common stock. Immediately after the reverse stock split, on December 3, 2014 we changed our state of incorporation from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 3, 2014, whereby we merged with and into our recently formed, wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger effecting the merger, we adopted the certificate of incorporation, as amended and restated, and bylaws of our Delaware subsidiary as our certificate of incorporation and bylaws at effective time of the merger. As a result, our certificate of incorporation, as amended and restated, authorizes the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, with such designation rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. Currently, our certificate of incorporation, as amended and restated, which was effective December 3, 2014, authorizes the issuance of up to 50,000,000 shares of common stock, of which approximately 26,715,960 shares remain available for issuance and may be issued by us without stockholder approval.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could prevent or delay transactions that our stockholders may favor and may prevent stockholders from changing the direction of our business or our management.\nAfter giving effect to our merger into our wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary, provisions of our certificate of incorporation, as amended and restated, and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares, and may also frustrate or prevent any attempt by stockholders to change the direction or management of us. For example, these provisions:\n\u2022 authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders;\n\u2022 eliminate the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022 prohibit stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u2022 establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nCompliance with changing corporate governance and public disclosure regulations may result in additional expense.\nKeeping abreast of, and in compliance with, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, new SEC regulations will require an increased amount of management attention and external resources. In addition, prior to the merger, our current management team was not subject to these laws and regulations, as the Company was a private corporation. We intend to continue to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards, which may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nOur Common Stock is thinly traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market exchange and no assurances can be made about stock performance, liquidity, or maintenance of our NASDAQ listing.\nHistorically, our common stock was quoted on the OTCQB, which provided significantly less liquidity than a securities exchange (such as the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market). On December 17, 2014, our common stock was approved for trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market, or NASDAQ. Beginning on December 23, 2014, our common stock began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol \u201cCTSO.\u201d Although currently listed on NASDAQ, there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet NASDAQ\u2019s minimum listing requirements or that of any other national exchange. In addition, there can be no assurances that a liquid market will be created for our common stock. If we are unable to maintain listing on the NASDAQ or if a liquid market for our common stock does not develop, our common stock may remain thinly traded.", "PERMNO": 15127, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "CTSO"}
