{"cik": "778164", "company": "Pacific Ethanol, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nBefore deciding to purchase, hold or sell our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained in this Report and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on Pacific Ethanol, our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity could be seriously harmed. In that event, the market price for our common stock will likely decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to the Merger with Aventine\nThe pendency of the merger with Aventine could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock, business, financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.\nWhile we are not aware of any significant adverse effects to date, the pendency of the merger with Aventine could disrupt our business in the following ways, among others:\n\u00b7 our customers and other third-party business partners may seek to terminate and/or renegotiate their relationships with us as a result of the merger, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements with us or otherwise;\n\u00b7 the attention of our management may be directed toward the completion of the merger and related matters and may be diverted from our day-to-day business operations, including from other opportunities that might otherwise be beneficial to us; and\n\u00b7 current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty regarding their future roles with the combined company, which might adversely affect our ability to retain, recruit and motivate key personnel.\nShould they occur, any of these matters could adversely affect our stock price, or harm our financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.\nFailure to complete the merger could adversely affect our stock price and future business and financial results.\nCompletion of the merger is subject to a number of conditions, including among other things, the receipt of approval of the Pacific Ethanol and Aventine stockholders. There is no assurance that the parties will receive the necessary approvals or satisfy the other conditions to the completion of the merger, including, among others, the condition that our volume-weighted average closing price per share for the 20 trading days immediately preceding the closing of the merger must equal or exceed $10.00. Failure to complete the proposed merger will prevent us and Aventine from realizing the anticipated benefits of the merger. We will also remain liable for significant transaction costs, including legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, unless provided otherwise by the merger agreement. In addition, the market price of our common stock may reflect various market assumptions as to whether the merger will occur. Consequently, the failure to complete the merger could result in a significant change in the market price of our common stock.\nObtaining required approvals necessary to satisfy the conditions to the completion of the merger may delay or prevent completion of the merger.\nTo complete the merger, our stockholders must approve the issuance of shares of our common stock and non-voting common stock and the amendment of our Certificate of Incorporation and holders of at least 66-2/3% of our Series B Cumulative Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock, or Series B Preferred Stock, must agree not to treat the merger as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up within the meaning of the Series B Certificate of Designations, each as contemplated by the merger agreement, and Aventine stockholders must adopt the merger agreement and approve the merger. In addition, the completion of the merger is conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental authorizations, consents, orders or other approvals. On February 18, 2014, the Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. Pacific Ethanol and Aventine intend to pursue all required approvals in accordance with the merger agreement. No assurance can be given that the required approvals will be obtained and, even if all such approvals are obtained, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the approvals or that they will satisfy the terms of the merger agreement.\nTermination of the merger agreement could negatively impact us.\nIf the merger agreement is terminated, there may be various consequences. For example, our business may be impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the merger. Additionally, if the merger agreement is terminated, the market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed. If the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we may be required to pay to Aventine a termination fee of $5,982,000 or an expense reimbursement amount of up to $1,994,000.\nThe market price of our common stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting our shares.\nUpon completion of the merger, holders of Aventine common stock will become holders of our common stock and/or non-voting common stock. Our business differs in important respects from that of Aventine, and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of our common stock after the completion of the merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting our operations.\nThe issuance of shares of our common stock to Aventine stockholders in the merger will substantially dilute the interest in Pacific Ethanol held by our stockholders prior to the merger.\nIf the merger is completed, it is estimated that we will issue up to approximately 17,755,300 shares of our common stock and non-voting common stock upon the closing of the merger, assuming no exercise or conversion of outstanding options and warrants. Based on the number of shares of Pacific Ethanol and Aventine common stock issued and outstanding on the Pacific Ethanol and Aventine record dates, Aventine stockholders before the merger will own, in the aggregate, approximately 42% of the aggregate number of shares of our common stock and non-voting common stock issued and outstanding immediately after the merger. The issuance of shares of our common stock and/or non-voting common stock to Aventine stockholders in the merger will cause a 42% reduction in the relative percentage interest of our current stockholders in the earnings, voting rights, liquidation value and book and market value of Pacific Ethanol. It is expected that Pacific Ethanol stockholders before the merger will hold approximately 58% of the total Pacific Ethanol common stock and non-voting common stock issued and outstanding immediately following the completion of the merger. In other words, Pacific Ethanol\u2019s stockholders before the merger will experience dilution in the amount of 42% as a result of the merger.\nRisks Related to the Combined Company if the Merger is Completed\nThe failure to successfully integrate the businesses of Pacific Ethanol and Aventine in the expected timeframe would adversely affect the combined company\u2019s future results following the completion of the merger.\nThe success of the merger will depend, in large part, on the ability of the combined company following the completion of the merger to realize the anticipated benefits from combining our business with the business of Aventine. To realize these anticipated benefits, the combined company must successfully integrate the businesses of Pacific Ethanol and Aventine. This integration will be complex and time-consuming.\nThe failure to integrate successfully and to manage successfully the challenges presented by the integration process may result in the combined company\u2019s failure to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of the merger.\nPotential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following:\n\u00b7 lost sales and customers as a result of customers of either of the two companies deciding not to do business with the combined company;\n\u00b7 complexities associated with managing the larger, more complex, combined business;\n\u00b7 integrating personnel from the two companies;\n\u00b7 potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the merger; and\n\u00b7 performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention caused by completing the merger and integrating the companies\u2019 operations.\nThe combined company\u2019s future results will suffer if the combined company does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the merger.\nFollowing the merger, the size of the combined company\u2019s business will be significantly larger than the current businesses of Pacific Ethanol and Aventine. The combined company\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges for the combined company\u2019s management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. Neither we nor Aventine can assure you that the combined company will be successful or that the combined company will realize the expected operating efficiencies, annual net operating synergies, revenue enhancements and other benefits currently anticipated to result from the merger.\nAventine is currently engaged in litigation regarding its Aurora West Facility located in Aurora, Nebraska.\nAmong other legal claims, the Aurora Coop has filed legal claims against Aventine asserting that it has the right, pursuant to an agreement between Aventine and the Aurora Coop, dated March 23, 2010, to exercise an option to acquire the 84 acres of land upon which the Aurora West Facility is located, together with the Aurora West Facility and all related improvements, for a purchase price of $16,500 per acre (approximately $1,386,000). The Aurora Coop asserts that its contractual right to exercise this option arose on July 1, 2012 due to Aventine\u2019s alleged failure to complete construction of the Aurora West Facility as of such date. The Aurora Coop asserts that it has the right to take title to the land on which the Aurora West Facility is located and all improvements thereon, including the Aurora West Facility. Aventine disputes the allegations and claims asserted by the Aurora Coop, and Aventine denies the validity and effectiveness of the Aurora Coop\u2019s exercise of its option to purchase the land on which the Aurora West Facility is located. Aventine has asserted in its legal filings that it has satisfied its contractual obligations with respect to the completion of the plant as of the required date. Aventine has advised that it will continue to vigorously defend against any assertion that the Aurora Coop has any right to repurchase the land or any improvements on the land. The action is currently pending in the United States District Court, Nebraska (Case No. 4:12 cv 0230). If Aventine is unsuccessful in defending this litigation, a number of outcomes may occur, including, without limitation, the conveyance of the land on which the Aurora West Facility is located (together with the Aurora West Facility and all related improvements) to the Aurora Coop for a purchase price that is substantially below the fair market value of the land and the facility, which Aventine believes would be an inequitable resolution of this claim, together with an unspecified amount of damages to the Aurora Coop related to the income the Aurora Coop alleges that it could have generated if the land had been conveyed as of an earlier date. An adverse outcome in Aventine\u2019s defense of this litigation, could materially adversely affect Aventine\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAventine is attempting to establish a rail connection in conjunction with the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad Company.\nAventine has advised that it is using its commercially reasonable efforts to complete all necessary arrangements, including engineering, design and contracting with the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad Company, or BNSF, as promptly as practicable, in order to establish a new connection through the rail facilities of its subsidiary, Nebraska Energy, L.L.C., or NELLC, to the inner rail loop track belonging to Aventine\u2019s Aurora West Facility along with the associated \u201cdiamond switch\u201d crossing the outer rail loop, along a path that lies entirely on land owned by NELLC or Aventine\u2019s subsidiary, Aventine Renewable Energy - Aurora West, LLC, such that the Aurora West Facility will be able to ship ethanol by rail in unit trains and single cars. However, there are no guarantees that Aventine will be able to complete the rail connection on a certain schedule (or at all). If such connection is not obtained it could have a material adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s future results following the completion of the merger.\nAn affiliate of Aventine is currently engaged in a dispute in connection its prior storage surplus beet sugar and amounts owed by such affiliate.\nIn 2013, Aventine Renewable Energy, Inc., a wholly owned affiliate of Aventine, or ARE, Inc., purchased surplus beet sugar through a U.S. Department of Agriculture program for Aventine\u2019s operations. The Western Sugar Cooperative, or Western Sugar, among other entities, warehoused this surplus sugar. ARE, Inc. paid for the warehousing of this sugar from inception of the relationship. Western Sugar, however, subsequently asserted that certain penalty rates for the storage of this product should have applied despite the lack of an agreement to such rates by ARE, Inc. Aventine and ARE, Inc. had been attempting to resolve the matter short of formal litigation when, on February 27, 2015, Western Sugar filed an action in the United States District Court, District of Colorado, seeking payment of the penalty storage fees as \u201cexpectation damages,\u201d in the amount of approximately $8.6 million. Aventine considers these claims to be without merit and will aggressively defend against them. ARE, Inc. and Aventine\u2019s inability to successfully defend this matter could have a material adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s future results following the completion of the merger.\nThe loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations after the merger.\nThe success of the merger will depend in part on the combined company\u2019s ability to retain key Pacific Ethanol and Aventine employees who continue employment with the combined company after the merger is completed. It is possible that these employees might decide not to remain with the combined company after the merger is completed. If these key employees terminate their employment, the combined company\u2019s business activities might be adversely affected, management\u2019s attention might be diverted from integrating Pacific Ethanol and Aventine to recruiting suitable replacements and the combined company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, the combined company might not be able to locate suitable replacements for any such key employees who leave the combined company or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms.\nThe success of the combined company will also depend on relationships with third parties and pre-existing customers of Pacific Ethanol and Aventine, which relationships may be affected by customer preferences or public attitudes about the merger. Any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe combined company\u2019s success will depend on the ability to maintain and renew business relationships, including relationships with pre-existing customers of both Pacific Ethanol and Aventine, and to establish new business relationships. There can be no assurance that the business of the combined company will be able to maintain pre-existing customer contracts and other business relationships, or enter into or maintain new customer contracts and other business relationships, on acceptable terms, if at all. The failure to maintain important business relationships could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the combined company.\nThe combined company will incur significant transaction and merger-related costs in connection with the merger.\nPacific Ethanol and Aventine expect to incur significant costs associated with completing the merger and combining the operations of the two companies. The exact magnitude of these costs is not yet known. In addition, there may be unanticipated costs associated with the integration. Although Pacific Ethanol and Aventine expect that the elimination of duplicative costs and other efficiencies may offset incremental transaction and merger-related costs over time, these benefits may not be achieved in the near term or at all.\nThe combined company will record goodwill that could become impaired and adversely affect the combined company\u2019s operating results.\nThe merger will be accounted for as an acquisition by Pacific Ethanol in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of Aventine will be recorded, as of completion, at their respective fair values and added to ours. The reported financial condition and results of operations of Pacific Ethanol issued after completion of the merger will reflect Aventine balances and results after completion of the merger, but will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of Aventine for periods prior to the merger. Following completion of the merger, the earnings of the combined company will reflect acquisition accounting adjustments.\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price will be allocated to Aventine\u2019s tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets based on their fair values as of the date of completion of the merger. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values will be recorded as goodwill. The merger may result in the creation of goodwill based upon the application of the acquisition method of accounting. To the extent the value of goodwill or intangibles becomes impaired, the combined company may incur material charges relating to such impairment. Such a potential impairment charge could have a material impact on the combined company\u2019s operating results.\nThe combined company\u2019s indebtedness following the merger will be greater than Pacific Ethanol\u2019s existing indebtedness. Therefore, it may be more difficult for the combined company to pay or refinance its debts and the combined company may need to divert its cash flow from operations to debt service payments. The additional indebtedness could limit the combined company\u2019s ability to pursue other strategic opportunities and increase its vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIn connection with the merger, the combined company will also be responsible for Aventine\u2019s outstanding debt. Our total indebtedness as of December 31, 2014 was approximately $34.5 million. Our pro forma total consolidated indebtedness as of December 31, 2014, after giving effect to the merger, would have been approximately $195.5 million (all of which would be non-current). The combined company\u2019s debt service obligations with respect to this increased indebtedness could have a material adverse impact on its earnings and cash flows, which after the merger would include the earnings and cash flows of Aventine, for as long as the indebtedness is outstanding.\nThe combined company\u2019s increased indebtedness could also have important consequences to holders of our common stock. For example, it could:\n\u00b7 make it more difficult for the combined company to pay or refinance its debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions because any decrease in revenues could cause the combined company to not have sufficient cash flows from operations to make its scheduled debt payments;\n\u00b7 limit the combined company\u2019s flexibility to pursue other strategic opportunities or react to changes in its business and the industry in which it operates and, consequently, place the combined company at a competitive disadvantage to its competitors with less debt; or\n\u00b7 require a substantial portion of the combined company\u2019s cash flows from operations to be used for debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and other general corporate purposes.\nBased upon current levels of operations, we expect the combined company to be able to generate sufficient cash on a consolidated basis to make all of the principal and interest payments when such payments are due under its existing credit facilities, indentures and other instruments governing their outstanding indebtedness, and the indebtedness of Aventine that may remain outstanding after the merger, but there can be no assurance that the combined company will be able to repay or refinance such borrowings and obligations.\nThe merger may not be accretive, and may be dilutive, to our earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nAlthough the merger is expected to be accretive to earnings per share, the merger may not be accretive, and may be dilutive, to our earnings per share. The expectation that the merger will be accretive is based on preliminary estimates that may materially change. All of the risk factors applicable to the ethanol industry and our business as a marketer and producer of ethanol are also be applicable to Aventine\u2019s business and will be applicable to the combined company after the merger. In addition, future events and conditions could decrease or delay any accretion, result in dilution or cause greater dilution than may be expected, including:\n\u00b7 adverse changes in market conditions;\n\u00b7 commodity prices for corn, ethanol, gasoline and crude oil;\n\u00b7 production levels;\n\u00b7 operating results;\n\u00b7 competitive conditions;\n\u00b7 laws and regulations affecting the ethanol business;\n\u00b7 capital expenditure obligations; and\n\u00b7 general economic conditions.\nAny dilution of, or decrease or delay of any accretion to, our earnings per share could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nBusiness issues currently faced by one company may be imputed to the operations of the other company or the combined company.\nTo the extent that either we or Aventine currently has or is perceived by customers to have operational challenges, those challenges may raise concerns by existing customers of the other company following the merger which may limit or impede our future ability to maintain relationships with those customers.\nResales of shares of our common stock to be issued upon closing of the merger, or a perception that a substantial number of such shares merger will be resold into the market, may cause the market price of our common stock and the value of your investment to decline significantly.\nWe currently estimate that we will issue up to an aggregate of approximately 17,755,300 shares of our common stock and non-voting common stock upon the closing of the merger, assuming no exercise or conversion of Aventine\u2019s outstanding options and warrants. A majority of the newly issued shares are subject to stockholders agreements entered into by us and certain stockholders of Aventine prohibiting the sale of our shares issued in connection with the merger for various periods of time. The issuance of these new shares of our common stock and non-voting common stock, and the sale of these new shares of common stock (including shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of shares of non-voting common stock issued in the merger) by current Aventine stockholders (i) after the merger, for those Aventine stockholders not subject to the stockholders agreements, or (ii) after applicable restrictive periods have passed for those Aventine stockholders subject to the stockholders agreements, or the perception that these sales could occur, could have the effect of depressing the market price for shares of our common stock. In addition, the issuance of shares of our common stock upon exercise of our outstanding options and warrants or upon conversion of our Series B Preferred Stock could also have the effect of depressing the market price for shares of our common stock.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe have incurred significant losses and negative operating cash flow in the past and we may incur losses and negative operating cash flow in the future, which may hamper our operations and impede us from expanding our business.\nWe have incurred significant losses and negative operating cash flow in the past. For 2013 and 2012, we incurred consolidated net losses of approximately $1.2 million and $43.4 million, respectively, and in 2012 incurred negative operating cash flow of $20.8 million. We may incur losses and negative operating cash flow in the future. We expect to rely on cash on hand and cash, if any, generated from our operations and from future financing activities to fund all of the cash requirements of our business. Continued losses and negative operating cash flow may hamper our operations and impede us from expanding our business.\nOur results of operations and our ability to operate at a profit is largely dependent on managing the costs of corn and natural gas and the prices of ethanol, WDG and other ethanol co-products, all of which are subject to significant volatility and uncertainty.\nOur results of operations are highly impacted by commodity prices, including the cost of corn and natural gas that we must purchase, and the prices of ethanol, WDG and other ethanol co-products that we sell. Prices and supplies are subject to and determined by market and other forces over which we have no control, such as weather, domestic and global demand, supply shortages, export prices and various governmental policies in the United States and around the world.\nAs a result of price volatility of corn, natural gas, ethanol, WDG and other ethanol co-products, our results of operations may fluctuate substantially. In addition, increases in corn or natural gas prices or decreases in ethanol, WDG or other ethanol co-product prices may make it unprofitable to operate. In fact, some of our marketing activities will likely be unprofitable in a market of generally declining ethanol prices due to the nature of our business. For example, to satisfy customer demands, we maintain certain quantities of ethanol inventory for subsequent resale. Moreover, we procure much of our inventory outside the context of a marketing arrangement and therefore must buy ethanol at a price established at the time of purchase and sell ethanol at an index price established later at the time of sale that is generally reflective of movements in the market price of ethanol. As a result, our margins for ethanol sold in these transactions generally decline and may turn negative as the market price of ethanol declines.\nNo assurance can be given that corn or natural gas can be purchased at, or near, current or any particular prices or that ethanol, WDG or other ethanol co-products will sell at, or near, current or any particular prices. Consequently, our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected by increases in the price of corn or natural gas or decreases in the price of ethanol, WDG or other ethanol co-products.\nOver the past several years, the spread between ethanol and corn prices has fluctuated significantly. Fluctuations are likely to continue to occur. A sustained narrow spread, whether as a result of sustained high or increased corn prices or sustained low or decreased ethanol prices, would adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Further, combined revenues from sales of ethanol, WDG and other ethanol co-products could decline below the marginal cost of production, which may force us to suspend production of ethanol, WDG and ethanol co-products at some or all of the Pacific Ethanol Plants.\nIncreased ethanol production may cause a decline in ethanol prices or prevent ethanol prices from rising, and may have other negative effects, adversely impacting our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe believe that the most significant factor influencing the price of ethanol has been the substantial increase in ethanol production in recent years. According to the RFA, domestic ethanol production capacity has increased from an annualized rate of 1.5 billion gallons per year in January 1999 to 14.5 billion gallons in 2014. In addition, due to significantly improved ethanol production margins, we anticipate that owners of idle ethanol production facilities, many of which were idled due to poor production margins, will restart operations, thereby resulting in more abundant ethanol supplies and inventories. Any increase in the demand for ethanol may not be commensurate with increases in the supply of ethanol, thus leading to lower ethanol prices. Also, demand for ethanol could be impaired due to a number of factors, including regulatory developments and reduced United States gasoline consumption. Reduced gasoline consumption has occurred in the past and could occur in the future as a result of increased gasoline or oil prices or other factors such as increased automobile fuel efficiency. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe market price of ethanol is volatile and subject to large fluctuations, which may cause our profitability or losses to fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of ethanol is volatile and subject to large fluctuations. The market price of ethanol is dependent upon many factors, including the supply of ethanol and the price of gasoline, which is in turn dependent upon the price of petroleum which is highly volatile and difficult to forecast. For example, ethanol prices, as reported by the CBOT, ranged from $1.50 to $3.52 per gallon during 2014 and corn prices, as reported by the CBOT, ranged from $3.21 to $5.16 per bushel during 2014. Fluctuations in the market price of ethanol may cause our profitability or losses to fluctuate significantly.\nSome of our marketing activities will likely be unprofitable in a market of generally declining ethanol prices due to the nature of our business.\nSome of our marketing activities will likely be unprofitable in a market of generally declining ethanol prices due to the nature of our business. For example, to satisfy customer demands, we maintain certain quantities of ethanol inventory for subsequent resale. Moreover, we procure much of our inventory outside the context of a marketing arrangement and therefore must buy ethanol at a price established at the time of purchase and sell ethanol at an index price established later at the time of sale that is generally reflective of movements in the market price of ethanol. As a result, our margins for ethanol sold in these transactions generally decline and may turn negative as the market price of ethanol declines.\nDisruptions in ethanol production infrastructure may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business depends on the continuing availability of rail, road, port, storage and distribution infrastructure. In particular, due to limited storage capacity at the Pacific Ethanol Plants and other considerations related to production efficiencies, the Pacific Ethanol Plants depend on just-in-time delivery of corn. The production of ethanol also requires a significant and uninterrupted supply of other raw materials and energy, primarily water, electricity and natural gas. The prices of electricity and natural gas have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future. Local water, electricity and gas utilities may not be able to reliably supply the water, electricity and natural gas that the Pacific Ethanol Plants will need or may not be able to supply those resources on acceptable terms. Any disruptions in the ethanol production infrastructure, whether caused by labor difficulties, earthquakes, storms, other natural disasters or human error or malfeasance or other reasons, could prevent timely deliveries of corn or other raw materials and energy and may require the Pacific Ethanol Plants to halt production which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe and the Pacific Ethanol Plants may engage in hedging transactions and other risk mitigation strategies that could harm our results of operations.\nIn an attempt to partially offset the effects of volatility of ethanol prices and corn and natural gas costs, the Pacific Ethanol Plants may enter into contracts to fix the price of a portion of their ethanol production or purchase a portion of their corn or natural gas requirements on a forward basis. In addition, we may engage in other hedging transactions involving exchange-traded futures contracts for corn, natural gas and unleaded gasoline from time to time. The financial statement impact of these activities is dependent upon, among other things, the prices involved and our ability to sell sufficient products to use all of the corn and natural gas for which forward commitments have been made. Hedging arrangements also expose us to the risk of financial loss in situations where the other party to the hedging contract defaults on its contract or, in the case of exchange-traded contracts, where there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and the actual prices paid or received by us. As a result, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the price of corn, natural gas, ethanol and unleaded gasoline.\nOperational difficulties at the Pacific Ethanol Plants could negatively impact sales volumes and could cause us to incur substantial losses.\nOperations at the Pacific Ethanol Plants are subject to labor disruptions, unscheduled downtimes and other operational hazards inherent in the ethanol production industry, including equipment failures, fires, explosions, abnormal pressures, blowouts, pipeline ruptures, transportation accidents and natural disasters. Some of these operational hazards may cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. Insurance obtained by the Pacific Ethanol Plants may not be adequate to fully cover the potential operational hazards described above or the Pacific Ethanol Plants may not be able to renew this insurance on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nMoreover, the production facilities at the Pacific Ethanol Plants may not operate as planned or expected. All of these facilities are designed to operate at or above a specified production capacity. The operation of these facilities is and will be, however, subject to various uncertainties. As a result, these facilities may not produce ethanol and its co-products at expected levels. In the event any of these facilities do not run at their expected capacity levels, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe United States ethanol industry is highly dependent upon certain federal and state legislation and regulation and any changes in legislation or regulation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe EPA has implemented the national RFS pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The national RFS program sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable fuels (such as ethanol) that must be blended into motor fuels consumed in the United States. The domestic market for ethanol is significantly impacted by federal mandates under the national RFS program for volumes of renewable fuels (such as ethanol) required to be blended with gasoline. Future demand for ethanol will be largely dependent upon incentives to blend ethanol into motor fuels, including the relative price of gasoline versus ethanol, the relative octane value of ethanol, constraints in the ability of vehicles to use higher ethanol blends, the national RFS, and other applicable environmental requirements. Any significant increase in production capacity above the national RFS minimum requirements may have an adverse impact on ethanol prices.\nLegislation aimed at reducing or eliminating the renewable fuel use required by the national RFS has been introduced in the United States Congress. On February 4, 2015, the RFS Elimination Act (H.R. 703) was introduced in the House of Representatives. The bill would fully repeal the national RFS. Also introduced on February 4, 2015, was the RFS Reform Act (H.R. 704), which prohibits corn-based ethanol from meeting the national RFS requirements, caps the amount of ethanol that can be blended into conventional gasoline at 10%, and requires the EPA to set requirements for cellulosic biofuels at actual production levels. On February 3, 2015, a bill (H.R. 21) was introduced in the House of Representatives to vacate the waiver issued by EPA allowing the use of 15% ethanol blends in certain light-duty vehicles. On February 26, 2015, the Corn Ethanol Mandate Elimination Act of 2015 was introduced in the Senate. The bill would eliminate corn ethanol as qualifying as a renewable fuel under the national RFS. All of these bills were assigned to a congressional committee, which will consider them before possibly sending any of them on to the House of Representatives or the Senate as a whole. Our operations could be adversely impacted if the RFS Elimination Act, the RFS Reform Act, the Corn Ethanol Mandate Elimination Act or other legislation is enacted that reduces or eliminates the national RFS volume requirements or that reduces or eliminates corn ethanol as qualifying as a renewable fuel under the national RFS.\nUnder the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the EPA has limited authority to waive or reduce the mandated national RFS requirements, which authority is subject to consultation with the Secretaries of Agriculture and Energy, and based on a determination that there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply or implementation of the applicable requirements would severely harm the economy or environment of a state, region or the United States. On November 15, 2013, the EPA released its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for the national RFS for 2014. The EPA proposed to reduce the RVO for 2014 for key categories of biofuel covered by the national RFS below the 2014 volumes specified in 2007 by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 and below the RVO for 2013. However, the EPA withdrew its proposal on December 9, 2014, and announced that it would not finalize the RVO for 2014 until 2015. The EPA has indicated that its previous 2014 draft proposal for a total of 15.2 billion gallons for all renewable fuels, including 13.0 billion gallons for conventional renewable fuels in 2014, will not be the final regulation and that it expects to issue the final RVO for 2014 in the second quarter of 2015. In addition, the EPA announced that it would propose the RVO for 2015 and 2016 simultaneously in 2015. Our operations could be adversely impacted if the EPA finalizes RVO levels that are below the levels specified in the national RFS.\nFuture demand for ethanol is uncertain and may be affected by changes to federal mandates, public perception, consumer acceptance and overall consumer demand for transportation fuel, any of which could negatively affect demand for ethanol and our results of operations.\nAlthough many trade groups, academics and governmental agencies have supported ethanol as a fuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment, others have criticized ethanol production as consuming considerably more energy and emitting more greenhouse gases than other biofuels and potentially depleting water resources. Some studies have suggested that corn-based ethanol is less efficient than ethanol produced from other feedstock and that it negatively impacts consumers by causing increased prices for dairy, meat and other food generated from livestock that consume corn. Additionally, ethanol critics contend that corn supplies are redirected from international food markets to domestic fuel markets. If negative views of corn-based ethanol production gain acceptance, support for existing measures promoting use and domestic production of corn-based ethanol could decline, leading to reduction or repeal of federal mandates, which would adversely affect the demand for ethanol. These views could also negatively impact public perception of the ethanol industry and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel.\nThere are limited markets for ethanol beyond those established by federal mandates. Discretionary blending and E85 blending are important secondary markets. Discretionary blending is often determined by the price of ethanol versus the price of gasoline. In periods when discretionary blending is financially unattractive, the demand for ethanol may be reduced. Also, the demand for ethanol is affected by the overall demand for transportation fuel, which peaked in 2007 and has declined steadily since then. Demand for transportation fuel is affected by the number of miles traveled by consumers and the fuel economy of vehicles. Market acceptance of E15 may partially offset the effects of decreases in transportation fuel demand. A reduction in the demand for ethanol and ethanol co-products may depress the value of our products, erode our margins and reduce our ability to generate revenue or to operate profitably. Consumer acceptance of E15 and E85 fuels is needed before ethanol can achieve any significant growth in market share relative to other transportation fuels.\nThe ethanol production and marketing industry is extremely competitive. Many of our significant competitors have greater production and financial resources and one or more of these competitors could use their greater resources to gain market share at our expense. In addition, a number of Kinergy\u2019s suppliers may circumvent the marketing services we provide, causing our sales and profitability to decline.\nThe ethanol production and marketing industry is extremely competitive. Many of our significant competitors in the ethanol production and marketing industry, including Archer Daniels Midland Company and Valero Energy Corporation, have substantially greater production and/or financial resources. As a result, our competitors may be able to compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time. Successful competition will require a continued high level of investment in marketing and customer service and support. Our limited resources relative to many significant competitors may cause us to fail to anticipate or respond adequately to new developments and other competitive pressures. This failure could reduce our competitiveness and cause a decline in market share, sales and profitability. Even if sufficient funds are available, we may not be able to make the modifications and improvements necessary to compete successfully.\nWe also face increasing competition from international suppliers. Currently, international suppliers produce ethanol primarily from sugar cane and have cost structures that are generally substantially lower than the cost structures of the Pacific Ethanol Plants. Any increase in domestic or foreign competition could cause the Pacific Ethanol Plants to reduce their prices and take other steps to compete effectively, which could adversely affect their and our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, some of our suppliers are potential competitors and, especially if the price of ethanol reaches historically high levels, they may seek to capture additional profits by circumventing our marketing services in favor of selling directly to our customers. If one or more of our major suppliers, or numerous smaller suppliers, circumvent our marketing services, our sales and profitability may decline.\nIf Kinergy fails to satisfy its financial covenants under its credit facility, it may experience a loss or reduction of that facility, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are substantially dependent on Kinergy\u2019s credit facility to help finance its operations. Kinergy must satisfy monthly financial covenants under its credit facility, including covenants regarding its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and fixed-charge coverage ratios. Kinergy will be in default under its credit facility if it fails to satisfy any financial covenant. A default may result in the loss or reduction of the credit facility. The loss of Kinergy\u2019s credit facility, or a significant reduction in Kinergy\u2019s borrowing capacity under the facility, would result in Kinergy\u2019s inability to finance a significant portion of its business and would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe high concentration of our sales within the ethanol production and marketing industry could result in a significant reduction in sales and negatively affect our profitability if demand for ethanol declines.\nWe expect to be completely focused on the production and marketing of ethanol and its co-products for the foreseeable future. We may be unable to shift our business focus away from the production and marketing of ethanol to other renewable fuels or competing products. Accordingly, an industry shift away from ethanol or the emergence of new competing products may reduce the demand for ethanol. A downturn in the demand for ethanol would likely materially and adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nIn addition to ethanol produced by the Pacific Ethanol Plants, we also depend on one third-party supplier for a significant portion of the ethanol we sell. If this supplier does not continue to supply us with ethanol in adequate amounts, we may be unable to satisfy the demands of our customers and our sales, profitability and relationships with our customers will be adversely affected.\nIn addition to the ethanol produced by the Pacific Ethanol Plants, we also depend, and expect to continue to depend for the foreseeable future, on one third-party supplier for a significant portion of the total amount of ethanol that we sell. During 2014, 2013 and 2012, one supplier provided in excess of 10% of the total volume of ethanol we sold, accounting for an aggregate of approximately $134.6 million, $145.2 million and $109.9 million in net sales, representing 12%, 16% and 13% of our net sales, respectively, for those periods. This third-party supplier is located in the Midwest. The delivery of ethanol from this supplier is therefore subject to delays resulting from inclement weather and other conditions. If this supplier is unable or declines for any reason to continue to supply us with ethanol in adequate amounts, we may be unable to replace that supplier and source other supplies of ethanol in a timely manner, or at all, to satisfy the demands of our customers. If this occurs, our sales, profitability and our relationships with our customers will be adversely affected.\nWe may be adversely affected by environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and liabilities.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the air, water and ground, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, and the health and safety of our employees. In addition, some of these laws and regulations require us to operate under permits that are subject to renewal or modification. These laws, regulations and permits can often require expensive pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment. A violation of these laws and regulations or permit conditions can result in substantial fines, natural resource damages, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or facility shutdowns. In addition, we have made, and expect to make, significant capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to comply with increasingly stringent environmental laws, regulations and permits.\nWe may be liable for the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination at each of the Pacific Ethanol Plants and at off-site locations where we arrange for the disposal of hazardous substances or wastes. If these substances or wastes have been or are disposed of or released at sites that undergo investigation and/or remediation by regulatory agencies, we may be responsible under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or other environmental laws for all or part of the costs of investigation and/or remediation, and for damages to natural resources. We may also be subject to related claims by private parties alleging property damage and personal injury due to exposure to hazardous or other materials at or from those properties. Some of these matters may require us to expend significant amounts for investigation, cleanup or other costs.\nIn addition, new laws, new interpretations of existing laws, increased governmental enforcement of environmental laws or other developments could require us to make significant additional expenditures. Continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues can be expected to result in increased future investments for environmental controls at the Pacific Ethanol Plants. Present and future environmental laws and regulations, and interpretations of those laws and regulations, applicable to our operations, more vigorous enforcement policies and discovery of currently unknown conditions may require substantial expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe hazards and risks associated with producing and transporting our products (including fires, natural disasters, explosions and abnormal pressures and blowouts) may also result in personal injury claims or damage to property and third parties. As protection against operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses. However, we could sustain losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks, or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. Events that result in significant personal injury or damage to our property or third parties or other losses that are not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our ability to operate effectively may be impaired.\nOur ability to operate our business and implement strategies depends, in part, on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. Our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to retain our current key personnel and attract and retain qualified future key personnel, particularly executive management. Failure to attract or retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe depend on a small number of customers for the majority of our sales. A reduction in business from any of these customers could cause a significant decline in our overall sales and profitability.\nThe majority of our sales are generated from a small number of customers. During 2014, 2013 and 2012, four customers accounted for an aggregate of approximately $659 million, $521 million and $410 million in net sales, representing 59%, 58% and 51% of our net sales, respectively, for those periods. We expect that we will continue to depend for the foreseeable future upon a small number of customers for a significant portion of our sales. Our agreements with these customers generally do not require them to purchase any specified amount of ethanol or dollar amount of sales or to make any purchases whatsoever. Therefore, in any future period, our sales generated from these customers, individually or in the aggregate, may not equal or exceed historical levels. If sales to any of these customers cease or decline, we may be unable to replace these sales with sales to either existing or new customers in a timely manner, or at all. A cessation or reduction of sales to one or more of these customers could cause a significant decline in our overall sales and profitability.\nOur lack of long-term ethanol orders and commitments by our customers could lead to a rapid decline in our sales and profitability.\nWe cannot rely on long-term ethanol orders or commitments by our customers for protection from the negative financial effects of a decline in the demand for ethanol or a decline in the demand for our marketing services. The limited certainty of ethanol orders can make it difficult for us to forecast our sales and allocate our resources in a manner consistent with our actual sales. Moreover, our expense levels are based in part on our expectations of future sales and, if our expectations regarding future sales are inaccurate, we may be unable to reduce costs in a timely manner to adjust for sales shortfalls. Furthermore, because we depend on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our sales, the magnitude of the ramifications of these risks is greater than if our sales were less concentrated. As a result of our lack of long-term ethanol orders and commitments, we may experience a rapid decline in our sales and profitability.\nThere are limitations on our ability to receive distributions from our subsidiaries.\nWe conduct most of our operations through subsidiaries and are dependent upon dividends or other intercompany transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to generate free cash flow. Moreover, some of our subsidiaries are limited in their ability to pay dividends or make distributions to us by the terms of their financing arrangements.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nOur stock price is highly volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors purchasing shares of our common stock and in litigation against us.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. The market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate in response to one or more of the following factors, many of which are beyond our control:\n\u00b7 fluctuations in the market prices of ethanol and its co-products, including WDG and corn oil;\n\u00b7 the cost of key inputs to the production of ethanol, including corn and natural gas;\n\u00b7 the volume and timing of the receipt of orders for ethanol from major customers;\n\u00b7 competitive pricing pressures;\n\u00b7 our ability to timely and cost-effectively produce, sell and deliver ethanol;\n\u00b7 the announcement, introduction and market acceptance of one or more alternatives to ethanol;\n\u00b7 losses resulting from adjustments to the fair values of our outstanding warrants to purchase our common stock;\n\u00b7 changes in market valuations of companies similar to us;\n\u00b7 stock market price and volume fluctuations generally;\n\u00b7 the possibility that the anticipated benefits from our pending acquisition of Aventine cannot be fully realized in a timely manner or at all, or that integrating future acquired operations will be more difficult, disruptive or costly than anticipated;\n\u00b7 regulatory developments or increased enforcement;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7 our inability to obtain any necessary financing;\n\u00b7 our financing activities and future sales of our common stock or other securities; and\n\u00b7 our ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations.\nFurthermore, we believe that the economic conditions in California and other Western states, as well as the United States as a whole, could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Demand for ethanol could also be adversely affected by a slow-down in the overall demand for oxygenate and gasoline additive products. The levels of our ethanol production and purchases for resale will be based upon forecasted demand. Accordingly, any inaccuracy in forecasting anticipated revenues and expenses could adversely affect our business. The failure to receive anticipated orders or to complete delivery in any quarterly period could adversely affect our results of operations for that period. Quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of future performance for any particular period, and we may not experience revenue growth or profitability on a quarterly or an annual basis.\nThe price at which you purchase shares of our common stock may not be indicative of the price that will prevail in the trading market. You may be unable to sell your shares of common stock at or above your purchase price, which may result in substantial losses to you and which may include the complete loss of your investment. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of high stock price volatility. We may be the target of similar litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and our resources away from our business.\nAny of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or the price of our common stock, or both.\nWe may incur significant non-cash expenses in future periods due to adjustments to the fair values of our outstanding warrants. These non-cash expenses may materially and adversely affect our reported net income or losses and cause our stock price to decline.\nFrom 2010 through 2013, we issued in various financing transactions warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. The warrants were initially recorded at their fair values, which are adjusted quarterly, generally resulting in non-cash expenses or income if the market price of our common stock increases or decreases, respectively, during the period. For example, due to the substantial increase in the market price of our common stock in the first quarter of 2014 and because the exercise prices of these warrants were, as of March 31, 2014, well below the market price of our common stock, the fair values of the warrants and the related non-cash expenses were significantly higher in the first quarter of 2014 than in prior quarterly periods, which resulted in an unusually large non-cash expense for the quarter. These fair value adjustments will continue in future periods until all of our warrants are exercised or expire. We may incur additional significant non-cash expenses in future periods due to adjustments to the fair values of our outstanding warrants resulting from increases in the market price of our common stock during those periods. These non-cash expenses may materially and adversely affect our reported net income or losses and cause our stock price to decline.\nThe conversion or exercise of our outstanding derivative securities or the issuance of shares of our common stock in lieu of accrued and unpaid dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock could substantially dilute your investment, reduce your voting power, and, if the resulting shares of common stock are resold into the market, or if a perception exists that a substantial number of shares may be issued and then resold into the market, the market price of our common stock and the value of your investment could decline significantly.\nOur Series B Preferred Stock, which is convertible into our common stock, and outstanding options to acquire our common stock issued to employees, directors and others, and warrants to purchase our common stock, allow the holders of these derivative securities an opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock. In addition, we may elect to issue shares of our common stock in lieu of accrued and unpaid cash dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock. We have issued common stock in respect of our derivative securities and accrued and unpaid dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock in the past and may do so in the future. If the prices at which our derivative securities are converted or exercised, or at which shares of common stock in lieu of accrued and unpaid dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock are issued, are lower than the price at which you made your investment, immediate dilution of the value of your investment will occur. Our issuance of shares of common stock under these circumstances will also reduce your voting power. In addition, sales of a substantial number of shares of common stock resulting from any of these issuances, or even the perception that these sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, you could experience a significant decline in the value of your investment as a result of both the actual and potential issuance of shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 86165, "SIC": 2860, "TIC": "PEIX"}
