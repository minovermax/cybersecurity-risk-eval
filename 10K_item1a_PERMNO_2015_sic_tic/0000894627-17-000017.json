{"cik": "894627", "company": "VAALCO ENERGY INC /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business faces many risks. You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report. If any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Any risks discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings could also have a material impact on our business, financial position or results of operations. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we consider immaterial based on information currently available to us may also materially adversely affect us.\nOil and natural gas prices are highly volatile, and a return to a very depressed price regime for a prolonged period of time will negatively affect our financial results.\nOur revenues, cash flow, profitability, oil and natural gas reserves value and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. Our ability to borrow funds and to obtain additional capital on reasonable terms is also substantially dependent on oil and natural gas prices. Historically, world-wide oil and natural gas prices and markets have been volatile, and may continue to be volatile in the future. In particular, the prices of oil and natural gas declined dramatically in the second half of 2014 and decreased further in 2015 and early 2016. During 2014, based on New York Mercantile Exchange (\u201cNYMEX\u201d) pricing, the spot price per Bbl of Brent crude oil ranged from a high of $115.19 to a low of $55.27, and the Henry Hub spot price per Mcf of natural gas ranged from a high of $6.00 to a low of $3.48. During 2015, the spot price per Bbl of Brent crude oil ranged from a high of $66.33 to a low of $35.26, and the Henry Hub spot price per Mcf of natural gas ranged from a high of $2.99 to a low of $1.93. During 2016, the spot price per Bbl of Brent crude oil ranged from a high of $54.96 to a low of $26.01, and the Henry Hub spot price per Mcf of natural gas ranged from a high of $3.80 to a low of $1.49.\nAs a result of the decline in oil and natural gas prices since 2014, our revenues, operating income, cash flows and borrowing capacity have been materially and adversely affected and have required reductions in the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and our planned level of capital expenditures. The average price at which we sold our crude oil in 2016 was $40.13 per Bbl compared to $47.85 per Bbl in 2015, and $93.66 per Bbl in 2014. Because the oil price we are required to use by the SEC to estimate our future net cash flows is the average price over the 12 months prior to the date of determination of future net cash flows, the full effect of increasing or falling prices may not be reflected in our estimated net cash flows for several quarters. We review the carrying value of our properties on a quarterly basis and once incurred, a write-down in the carrying value of our properties is not reversible at a later date, even if oil and natural gas prices increase.\nPrices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, increases in supplies from U.S. shale production, international political conditions, including uprisings and political unrest in the Middle East and Africa, the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas, actions by OPEC member countries and other state-controlled oil companies to agree upon and maintain oil price and production controls, the level of consumer demand due to slowing economic growth in China and continued weak economic growth in Europe, weather conditions, domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels, the health of international economic and credit markets, and general economic conditions. In addition, various factors, including the effect of federal, state and foreign regulation of production and transportation, general economic conditions, changes in supply due to drilling by other producers and changes in demand may adversely affect our ability to market our oil and natural gas production.\nUnless we are able to replace the proved reserve quantities that we have produced, our cash flows and production will decrease over time.\nAt December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no proved undeveloped reserves. We expect to make minimal capital expenditures for our development activities during 2017.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable. In general, production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics. Our ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our asset base of oil and gas reserves would be limited to the extent cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. We may not be successful in exploring for, developing or acquiring additional reserves. Except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our estimated net proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are produced.\nThere can be no assurance that our development and exploration projects and acquisition activities will result in significant additional reserves or that we will have continuing success drilling productive wells at economic finding costs. The drilling of oil and natural gas wells involves a high degree of risk, especially the risk of dry holes or of wells that are not sufficiently productive to provide an economic return on the capital expended to drill the wells. In addition, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including declines in oil or natural gas prices, title problems, weather conditions, political instability, availability of capital, economic/currency imbalances, compliance with governmental requirements, receipt of additional seismic data or the reprocessing of existing data, prolonged periods of historically low oil and natural gas prices, failure of wells drilled in similar formations, equipment failures (such as our experience with our electronic submersible pumps in 2016 - see Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Segment and Geographic Information - Gabon Segment - Development\u201d), delays in the delivery of equipment and availability of\ndrilling rigs. Our Equatorial Guinea property is operated by third parties and, as a result, we have limited control over the nature and timing of exploration and development of such properties or the manner in which operations are conducted on such properties.\nExploring for, developing, or acquiring reserves is capital intensive and uncertain.\nWe may not be able to economically find, develop, or acquire additional reserves, or may not be able to make the necessary capital investments to develop our reserves, if our cash flows from operations decline or external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. Offshore drilling and development operations require capital-intensive techniques. If we do not replace the reserves we produce, our reserves revenues and cash flow will decrease over time, which will have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur business requires significant capital expenditures and we may not be able to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all.\nOur exploration and development activities are capital intensive. To replace and grow our reserves, we must make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploitation, development, exploration and production of oil and natural gas reserves. Historically, we have financed these expenditures primarily with cash flow from operations, debt, asset sales, and private sales of equity. We are the operator of the Etame Marin block offshore Gabon, and are thus responsible for contracting on behalf of all the remaining parties participating in the project. We rely on the timely payment of cash calls by our partners to pay for 66.43% of the offshore Gabon budget. The continued economic health of our partners could be adversely affected by low oil prices, thereby adversely affecting their ability to make timely payment of cash calls.\nIf low oil and natural gas prices, operating difficulties or declines in reserves result in our revenues being less than expected or limit our ability to borrow funds, or our partners fail to pay their share of project costs, we may be unable to obtain or expend the capital necessary to undertake or complete future drilling programs. Our ability to secure additional or replacement financing is currently limited. We cannot assure you that additional debt or equity financing or cash generated by operations will be available to meet our capital requirements. The outstanding indebtedness under our term loan with the IFC matures in June 2019. Interest is due quarterly, and we must begin repaying the principal amounts of this outstanding indebtedness in March 2017. We may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. If cash generated by operations or cash available under any financing sources is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to the development of our properties. Such a curtailment in operations could lead to a possible expiration of our PSCs and a decline in our estimated net proved reserves, and would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur amended loan agreement imposes significant restrictions on our current and future operations. If we default under the amended loan agreement, the lender may act to accelerate our indebtedness, which would impact our ability to conduct our business and results of operations.\nThe current $15 million outstanding indebtedness under our amended term loan agreement matures in June 2019, and requires quarterly principal and interest payments on the amounts currently outstanding commencing on March 31, 2017 and continuing through June 30, 2019.\nThe amended agreement contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, which may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best interests. These covenants include restrictions on our ability to:\n\u00b7\nincur additional indebtedness, guarantee debt or enter into any arrangement to assume or become obligated for financial or other obligations of another (except pursuant to a joint operating agreement);\n\u00b7\npay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of, or purchase or redeem, shares of our capital stock;\n\u00b7\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u00b7\nmake loans, investments and other restricted payments;\n\u00b7\nsell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u00b7\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u00b7\nsell, transfer or lease all or a substantial part of our assets (other than inventory or depleted or obsolete assets in the ordinary course of business);\n\u00b7\nenter into non-arm\u2019s-length transactions;\n\u00b7\nincur or commit to make certain expenditures for fixed or other non-current assets;\n\u00b7\nenter into lease agreements or arrangements, other than the FPSO contract and leases necessary to carry on our business;\n\u00b7\nform any subsidiary;\n\u00b7\nterminate, amend or grant consents or waivers with respect to certain material contracts;\n\u00b7\nuse the proceeds of loans other than as permitted by the credit agreement;\n\u00b7\nreduce certain of our working interests;\n\u00b7\nmodify our organizational documents;\n\u00b7\nalter the business we conduct;\n\u00b7\nundertake or permit any merger, spin-off, consolidation or reorganization; and\n\u00b7\nenter into any derivative transaction without prior approval.\nIn addition, the amended loan agreement includes certain financial ratios, including;\n\u00b7\na debt service coverage ratio of (i) net cash flows (plus a balance in an operating account) to (ii) debt service obligations, of at least 1.2:1 at each quarter end; and\n\u00b7\na ratio of (i) net debt as of the end of a fiscal quarter to (ii) earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, and exploration expenses (EBITDAX) for the trailing 12 months ended on the most recent quarter end, at less than 3.0:1, except the quarter-end limitation has been raised to 5.0:1 for periods through December 31, 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants under our amended loan agreement. However, we can make no assurance that we will be able to continue to comply with these financial covenants in the future. Failure to maintain these covenants or otherwise negotiate amendments to the amended loan agreement could require us to immediately pay down any outstanding amounts.\nThese covenants have the effect of restricting our ability to engage in certain actions, including potentially limiting our ability to sell assets or incur other additional indebtedness. Our ability to meet our net debt to EBITDAX ratio and our different coverage ratio requirements can be affected by events beyond our control, including changes in commodity prices. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with these covenants in future periods. In addition, if we receive any additional waivers or amendments to our amended loan agreement, the lender may impose additional operating and financial restrictions on us.\nA breach of the covenants under our amended loan agreement could result in an event of default under the agreement. Such a default may allow the lender to accelerate payment of the indebtedness under the amended loan agreement. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the amended loan agreement, the lender could proceed against the collateral granted to it to secure that indebtedness.\nAll of the value of our production and proved reserves is concentrated in a single block offshore Gabon, and any production problems or reductions in reserve estimates related to this property would adversely impact our business.\nThe Etame Marin block consists of five fields with 11 producing wells. Production from these fields constituted approximately 99% of our total production for the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, at December 31, 2016, 100% of our total net proved reserves were attributable to these fields. If mechanical problems, storms or other events curtailed a substantial portion of this production, or if the actual reserves associated with this producing property are less than our estimated reserves, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nBecause the PSCs relating to these properties are concentrated in the same geographic area, many of our rights under the PSCs will be affected by the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than with respect to companies that have a more diversified portfolio of licenses and properties located across diverse geographic areas.\nIncreases in U.S. oil production from unconventional resources coupled with slower economic growth in economies around the world and prior actions taken by OPEC members have led to a dramatic reduction in oil prices. While lower oil prices may have the effect of escalating global economic growth rates, and thereby increase demand for oil supplies, a prolonged period of low oil prices will adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe increase in world oil supplies being produced, due to increased U.S. shale production and OPEC\u2019s past decisions not to reduce production to support higher oil prices occurred at the same time as reduced economic activity associated with slower economic growth in China, Europe and other global economies reduced demand for, and the prices we receive for, our oil and natural gas production. The U.S. federal government in December 2015 lifted its decades-old prohibition of exports of crude oil produced in the lower 48 states of the U.S.; it is uncertain what impact this regulatory change will have on our operations or our sales of crude oil. A reduction in the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the borrowing base under our credit facility.\n\ufeff\nOther governmental actions, including the recent accord by OPEC members to reduce production, may impact oil prices, although it is uncertain as to whether this accord will continue, or whether it will continue to be honored by OPEC member countries. In addition, it is uncertain what impact the recent election of President Trump will have on the exploration for and production of oil, natural gas and NGLs in the U.S. Increased domestic oil and natural gas production in a changing regulatory environment could impact the price of oil.\nIf oil and natural gas prices remain at low levels for extended periods of time, we may be required to take further write-downs in the value of our oil and natural gas properties.\nThe estimated future net revenues attributable to our net proved reserves are prepared in accordance with current SEC guidelines, and are not intended to reflect the fair market value of our reserves. In accordance with the rules of the SEC, our reserve estimates are prepared using the un-weighted average price received for oil and natural gas based on closing prices on the first day of each month during the twelve-month period prior to the end of the reporting period. As a result of declines in prices and increased development well costs, during 2015, we recorded additional impairments totaling $81.3 million related to the Etame Marin block and to various fields in the U.S. During 2016, no impairments were necessary related to the Etame Marin block. The sale of our interests in two wells in North Texas caused us to perform an impairment test, resulting in a $0.1 million impairment charge taken during the third quarter of\n2016. Sustained lower prices will cause the estimated quantities and present values of our reserves to be reduced, which may necessitate further write-downs.\nWe rely on a single purchaser of our Gabon production, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe currently sell our crude oil production from Gabon under a term contract with Glencore at pricing based upon an average of Dated Brent in the month of lifting, adjusted for location and market factors, that ends in January 2018.\nIn January 2016, we announced the formation of a strategic committee of our board of directors to oversee the consideration of various strategic alternatives potentially available to us in order to maximize our value.\nA strategic committee of our directors formed by our board of directors in January 2016 is authorized to explore strategic options for VAALCO, including, but not limited to, securing additional investment to support existing projects and growth opportunities, joint ventures, asset sales or farm-outs, our potential sale or merger, or continuing to pursue our existing operating plan. We will continue to pursue ways to increase our liquidity. However, we can give no assurances that any of these strategic alternatives can be completed, and if so, on reasonable terms that are acceptable to us.\nThe formation of the strategic committee was not in response to any proposal we received or any approach by a third party.\nNo decision has been made to engage in any particular transaction or transactions. There can be no assurance that the strategic committee or our board of directors will authorize the pursuit of any strategic alternative. Moreover, there can be no assurance with respect to the terms or the timing of any transaction, or whether any transaction will ultimately occur. Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends, the interest of third parties in our areas of operation and the availability of financing to potential buyers on reasonable terms.\nUntil the fourth quarter of 2016, prevailing market conditions, including commodity prices, were unfavorable for our business, and constrained our ability to move forward with any possible transactions. There can be no assurances that we will be able to identify or complete any strategic transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that any such transaction would be favorable to our stockholders or lenders, or our business.\nOur offshore operations involve special risks that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOffshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks specific to the marine environment. Our production facilities are subject to hazards such as capsizing, sinking, grounding, collision and damage from severe weather conditions. The relatively deep offshore drilling conducted by us involves increased drilling risks of high pressures and mechanical difficulties, including stuck pipe, collapsed casing and separated cable. The impact that any of these risks may have upon us is increased due to the low number of producing properties we own. We could incur substantial expenses that could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration, development or license acquisitions, or result in loss of equipment and license interests.\nExploration and development operations offshore Africa often lack the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in other regions. As a result, a significant amount of time may elapse between an offshore discovery and the marketing of the associated oil and natural gas, increasing both the financial and operational risks involved with these operations. Offshore drilling operations generally require more time and more advanced drilling technologies, involving a higher risk of equipment failure and usually higher drilling costs. In addition, there may be production risks of which we are currently unaware. For example, the production of hydrogen sulfide at our Etame 8-H well, which caused us to shut in the well in December 2014, created unexpected production losses and delays in our development plans; see Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Segment and Geographic Information - Hydrogen Sulfide Impact.\u201d The development of new subsea infrastructure and use of floating production systems to transport oil from producing wells, may require substantial time for installation or encounter mechanical difficulties and equipment failures that could result in loss of production, significant liabilities, cost overruns or delays.\nIn addition, in the event of a well control incident, containment and, potentially, cleanup activities for offshore drilling are costly. The resulting regulatory costs or penalties, and the results of third party lawsuits, as well as associated legal and support expenses, including costs to address negative publicity, could well exceed the actual costs of containment and cleanup. As a result, a well control incident could result in substantial liabilities for us, and have a significant negative impact on our earnings, cash flows, liquidity, financial position, and stock price.\nOur drilling activities require us to risk significant amounts of capital that may not be recovered.\nDrilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be encountered. There can be no assurance that new wells drilled by us will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment. Drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells, but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues to return a profit after drilling, operating and other costs. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain and cost overruns are common. Our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including title problems, weather conditions, equipment failures or accidents, elevated pressure or irregularities in geologic formations, compliance with governmental requirements and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment and services.\nWe have less control over our investments in foreign properties than we would have with respect to domestic investments, and added risk in foreign countries may affect our foreign investments.\nOur international assets and operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties, including, among other things, the risks of war, expropriation, nationalization, renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts, taxation policies, foreign exchange restrictions, changing political conditions, international monetary fluctuations, currency controls and foreign governmental regulations that favor or require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. For example, the Gabonese government has recently audited the accounts of a number of energy companies, including ours, that has led to disputes. The Gabonese government has formed a new oil company that may seek to participate in oil and natural gas projects in a manner that could be dilutive to the interest of current license holders and the Gabonese government is under pressure from the Gabonese labor union to require companies to hire a higher percentage of Gabonese citizens. In 2016, the government of Gabon conducted an audit of our operations in Gabon, covering the years 2013 through 2014. We received the findings from this audit and responded to the audit findings in January 2017. While we do not anticipate that we will be subject to assessments for 2013 through 2014 that will have significant, if any, negative impact on our reported earnings or cash flows, we can make no assurances that this will be the case. In addition, if a dispute arises with our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons, especially foreign oil ministries and national oil companies, to the jurisdiction of the U.S.\nPrivate ownership of oil and natural gas reserves under oil and natural gas leases in the U.S. differs distinctly from our rights in foreign reserves where the state generally retains ownership of the minerals, and in many cases participates in, the exploration and production of hydrocarbon reserves. Accordingly, operations outside the U.S. may be materially affected by host governments through royalty payments, export taxes and regulations, surcharges, value added taxes, production bonuses and other charges. Gabon has indicated an interest in taking their oil in kind rather than our continuing to market their share of production on their behalf, which could cause fluctuations in the timing of and realized prices for oil sales.\nAll of our proved reserves are related to the Etame Marin block located offshore Gabon. We have operated in Gabon since 1995 and believe we have good relations with the current Gabonese government. However, there can be no assurance that present or future administrations or governmental regulations in Gabon will not materially adversely affect our operations or cash flows.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by violent acts such as from civil disturbances, terrorist acts, regime changes, cross-border violence, war, piracy, or other conflicts that may occur in regions that encompass our operations.\nViolent acts resulting in loss of life, destruction of property, environmental damage and pollution occur around the world. Many incidents are driven by civil, ethnic, religious or economic strife. In addition, the number of incidents attributed to various terrorist organizations has increased significantly. We operate in regions of the world that have experienced such incidents or are in close proximity to areas where violence has occurred.\nWe monitor the economic and political environments of the countries in which we operate. However, we are unable to predict the occurrence of disturbances such as those noted above. In addition, we have limited ability to mitigate their impact.\nCivil disturbances, terrorist acts, regime changes, war, or conflicts, or the threats thereof, could have the following results, among others:\n\u00b7\nvolatility in global crude oil prices which could negatively impact the global economy, resulting in slower economic growth rates, which could reduce demand for our products;\n\u00b7\nnegative impact on the world crude oil supply if infrastructure or transportation are disrupted, leading to further commodity price volatility;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to work in areas with potential for conflict;\n\u00b7\ninability of our personnel or supplies to enter or exit the countries where we are conducting operations;\n\u00b7\ndisruption of our operations due to evacuation of personnel;\n\u00b7\ninability to deliver our production due to disruption or closing of transportation routes;\n\u00b7\nreduced ability to export our production due to efforts of countries to conserve domestic resources;\n\u00b7\ndamage to or destruction of our wells, production facilities, receiving terminals or other operating assets;\n\u00b7\ndamage to or destruction of property belonging to our commodity purchasers leading to interruption of deliveries, claims of force majeure, and/or termination of commodity sales contracts, resulting in a reduction in our revenues;\n\u00b7\ninability of our service and equipment providers to deliver items necessary for us to conduct our operations resulting in a halt or delay in our planned exploration activities, delayed development of major projects, or shut-in of producing fields;\n\u00b7\nlack of availability of drilling rig, oilfield equipment or services if third party providers decide to exit the region;\n\u00b7\nshutdown of a financial system, communications network, or power grid causing a disruption to our business activities; and\n\u00b7\ncapital market reassessment of risk and reduction of available capital making it more difficult for us and our partners to obtain financing for potential development projects.\nLoss of property and/or interruption of our business plans resulting from civil unrest could have a significant negative impact on our earnings and cash flow. In addition, we may not have enough insurance to cover any loss of property or other claims resulting from these risks.\nCyber-attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used by the oil and natural gas industry may adversely impact our operations.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, production and financial activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and natural gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, and communicate with our employees and third party partners. Unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruptions in our exploration or production operations. Also, computers control nearly all of the oil and natural gas distribution systems, which are necessary to transport our production to market. A cyber-attack directed at oil and natural gas distribution systems could damage critical distribution and storage assets or the environment, delay or prevent delivery of production to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. While we have not experienced significant cyber-attacks, there is no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks and resulting losses in the future. Further, as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber-attacks.\nCompetitive industry conditions may negatively affect our ability to conduct operations.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive. We compete with, and may be outbid by, competitors in our attempts to acquire exploration and production rights in oil and natural gas properties. These properties include exploration prospects as well as properties with proved reserves. There is also competition for contracting for drilling equipment and the hiring of experienced personnel. Factors that affect our ability to compete in the marketplace include:\n\u00b7\nour access to the capital necessary to drill wells and acquire properties;\n\u00b7\nour ability to acquire and analyze seismic, geological and other information relating to a property;\n\u00b7\nour ability to retain and hire the personnel necessary to properly evaluate seismic and other information relating to a property;\n\u00b7\nour ability to retain and hire experienced personnel, especially for our engineering, geoscience and accounting departments; and;\n\u00b7\nthe location of, and our ability to access, platforms, pipelines and other facilities used to produce and transport oil and natural gas production.\nOur competitors include major integrated oil companies and substantial independent energy companies, many of which possess greater financial, technological, personnel and other resources than we do. These companies may be able to pay more for oil and natural gas properties, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties than our financial or human resources permit, and may be better able than we are to continue drilling during periods of low oil and natural gas prices, to contract for drilling equipment and to secure trained personnel. Our competitors may also use superior technology which we may be unable to afford or which would require costly investment by us in order to compete.\nWeather, unexpected subsurface conditions and other unforeseen operating hazards may adversely impact our oil and natural gas activities.\nThe oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks, including fire, explosions, blow-outs, pipe failure, casing collapse, abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, ruptures and discharges of toxic gases, underground migration and surface spills or mishandling of fracture fluids including chemical additives, the occurrence of any of which could result in substantial losses to us due to injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution and other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations.\nWe maintain insurance against some, but not all, potential risks; however, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover any losses or exposure for liability. The occurrence of a significant unfavorable event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, we cannot predict whether insurance will continue to be available at a reasonable cost or at all.\nSignificant physical effects of climate change have the potential to damage our facilities, disrupt our production activities and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nIn interpretive guidance on climate change disclosure, the SEC indicates that climate change could have an effect on the severity of weather (including hurricanes and floods), sea levels, the arability of farmland, and water availability and quality. If such effects were to occur, our exploration and production operations have the potential to be adversely affected. Potential adverse effects could include damages to our facilities from powerful winds or rising waters in low-lying areas, disruption of our production activities because of climate-related damages to our facilities and our costs of operation potentially arising from such climatic effects, less efficient or non-routine operating practices necessitated by climate effects or increased costs for insurance coverages in the aftermath of such effects.\nSignificant physical effects of climate change could also have an indirect effect on our financing and operations by disrupting the transportation or process-related services provided by midstream companies, service companies or suppliers with whom we have a business relationship. We may not be able to recover through insurance some or any of the damages, losses or costs that may result from potential physical effects of climate change.\nWe may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks we face and operators of prospects in which we participate may not maintain or may fail to obtain adequate insurance.\nOur business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production, gathering, processing, and transportation of oil and natural gas, including blowouts, cratering and fire, any of which could result in damage to, or destruction of, oil and natural gas wells or formations, production facilities, and other property, as well as injury to persons. For protection against financial loss resulting from these operating hazards, we maintain insurance coverage, including insurance coverage for certain physical damage, blowout/control of a well, comprehensive general liability, and worker\u2019s compensation and employer\u2019s liability. However, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover us against 100% of potential losses arising as a result of the foregoing, and for certain risks, such as political risk, nationalization, business interruption, war, terrorism, and piracy, for which we have limited or no coverage. In addition, we are not insured against all risks in all aspects of our business, such as hurricanes. The occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur reserve information represents estimates that may turn out to be incorrect if the assumptions upon which these estimates are based are inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present values of our reserves.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves, including many factors beyond our control. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating the underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The estimates included in this document are based on various assumptions required by the SEC, including non-escalated prices and costs and capital expenditures subsequent to December 31, 2016, and, therefore, are inherently imprecise indications of future net revenues. Actual future production, revenues, taxes, operating expenses, development expenditures and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves.\nIn addition, our reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision based upon production history, results of future development, availability of funds to acquire additional reserves, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors. Moreover, the calculation of the estimated present value of the future net revenue using a 10% discount rate as required by the SEC is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with our reserves or the oil and natural gas industry in general. It is also possible that reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and future net revenues based on the same available data.\nThe estimated future net revenues attributable to our net proved reserves are prepared in accordance with current SEC guidelines, and are not intended to reflect the fair market value of our reserves. In accordance with the rules of the SEC, our reserve estimates are prepared using an average of beginning of month prices received for oil and natural gas for the preceding twelve months. Future reductions in prices below the average calculated for 2016 would result in the estimated quantities and present values of our reserves being reduced.\nOur proved reserves are in foreign countries and are or will be subject to service contracts, production sharing contracts and other arrangements. The quantity of oil and natural gas that we will ultimately receive under these arrangements will differ based on numerous factors, including the price of oil and natural gas, production rates, production costs, cost recovery provisions and local tax and royalty regimes. Changes in many of these factors could affect the estimates of proved reserves in foreign jurisdictions.\nOur results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and compliance with debt covenants could be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risk from our foreign operations. While oil sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, portions of our costs in Gabon are denominated in the local currency. A weakening U.S. dollar will have the effect of increasing costs while a strengthening U.S. dollar will have the effect of reducing operating costs. The Gabon local currency is tied to the Euro. The exchange rate between the Euro and the U.S. dollar has fluctuated widely in recent years in response to international political conditions, general economic conditions, the European sovereign debt crisis and other factors beyond our control. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and compliance with debt covenants could be adversely affected by such fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively impact our earnings, which are subject to financial covenants under our amended loan agreement. Failure to maintain these covenants could preclude us from borrowing under our amended loan agreement and require us to immediately pay down any outstanding amounts under the agreement, which could affect cash flows or restrict business. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our amended loan agreement.\nAcquisitions and divestitures of properties and businesses subject our company to additional risks and uncertainties. We may be unable to integrate successfully the operations of any acquisitions with our operations, and we may not realize all the anticipated\nbenefits of any future acquisitions. Any sales or divestments of properties we make may result in certain liabilities that we are required to retain under the terms of such sale or divestment.\nFailure to successfully exploit any acquisitions we engage in could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, unexpected costs and challenges may arise whenever businesses with different operations or management are combined, and we may experience unanticipated delays in realizing the benefits of an acquisition. If we consummate any future acquisition, our capitalization and results of operation may change significantly, and you may not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in evaluating future acquisitions.\nIn the case of sales or divestitures of our properties, we may become exposed to future liabilities that arise under the terms of those sales or divestitures. Under such terms, sellers typically are required to retain certain liabilities for matters with respect to their sold properties. The magnitude of any such retained liability or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction and ultimately may be material. Also, as is typical in divestiture transactions, third parties may be unwilling to release us from guarantees or other credit support provided prior to the sale of the divested assets. As a result, after a sale, we may remain secondarily liable for the obligations guaranteed or supported to the extent that the buyer of the assets fails to perform these obligations.\nProperties that we buy may not produce as projected, and we may be unable to determine reserve potential, identify liabilities associated with the properties or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities, which could result in material liabilities and adversely affect our financial condition.\nOne of our growth strategies is to capitalize on opportunistic acquisitions of oil and natural gas reserves. Any future acquisition will require an assessment of recoverable reserves, title, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential environmental hazards, potential tax and employer liabilities, and other liabilities and similar factors. Ordinarily, our review efforts are focused on the higher valued properties and are inherently incomplete because it generally is not feasible to review in depth every potential liability on each individual property involved in each acquisition. Even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and potential problems, such as ground water contamination and other environmental conditions and deficiencies in the mechanical integrity of equipment are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Any unidentified problems could result in material liabilities and costs that negatively impact our financial condition.\nAdditional potential risks related to acquisitions include, among other things:\n\u00b7\nincorrect assumptions regarding the reserves, future production and revenues, or future operating or development costs with respect to the acquired properties, as well as future prices of oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\ndecreased liquidity as a result of using a significant portion of our cash from operations or borrowing capacity to finance acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nsignificant increases in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nthe assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate;\n\u00b7\nan increase in our costs or a decrease in our revenues associated with any claims or disputes with governments or other interest owners;\n\u00b7\nthe risk that oil and natural gas reserves acquired may not be of the anticipated magnitude or may not be developed as anticipated;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in the assimilation of the assets and operations of the acquired business, especially if the assets acquired are in a new business segment or geographic area;\n\u00b7\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u00b7\nlosses of key employees at the acquired businesses;\n\u00b7\noperating a significantly larger combined organization and adding operations;\n\u00b7\nthe failure to realize expected profitability or growth;\n\u00b7\nthe failure to realize expected synergies and cost savings; and\n\u00b7\ncoordinating or consolidating corporate and administrative functions.\nIf we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly.\nWe have been, and in the future may become, involved in legal proceedings with governmental and private litigants, and, as a result, may incur substantial costs in connection with those proceedings.\nOur business subjects us to liability risks from litigation or government actions.\nFrom time to time we may be a defendant or plaintiff in various lawsuits. The nature of our operations exposes us to further possible litigation claims in the future. There is risk that any matter in litigation could be decided unfavorably against us regardless of our\nbelief, opinion, and position, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow. Litigation can be very costly, and the costs associated with defending litigation could also have a material adverse effect on our net income, net cash flows and financial condition. Adverse litigation decisions or rulings may also damage our business reputation.\nOften, our operations are conducted through joint ventures over which we may have limited influence and control. Private litigation or government proceedings brought against us could also result in significant delays in our operations.\nCompliance with environmental and other government regulations could be costly and could negatively impact production.\nThe laws and regulations of the U.S., Gabon, and Equatorial Guinea regulate our current business. These laws and regulations may require that we obtain permits for our development, limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain protected or sensitive areas, or restrict the substances that can be released in connection with our operations. Our operations could result in liability for personal injuries, property damage, natural resource damages, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up costs and other environmental damages. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties and the issuance of orders enjoining operations. In addition, we could be liable for environmental damages caused by, among others, previous property owners or operators of properties that we purchase or lease. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liabilities for remediation of releases of hazardous substances, rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. As a result, we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities and may be required to incur substantial remediation costs. We could also be affected by more stringent laws and regulations adopted in the future, including any related to climate change and greenhouse gases and use of hydraulic fracturing fluids, resulting in increased operating costs. As a result, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the payment of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Additionally, more stringent GHG regulation could impact demand for oil and natural gas.\nThese laws and governmental regulations, which cover matters including drilling operations, taxation and environmental protection, may be changed from time to time in response to economic or political conditions and could have a significant impact on our operating costs, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general. While we believe that we are currently in compliance with environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations, no assurances can be given that we will be able to continue to comply with such environmental laws and regulations without incurring substantial costs.\nIf our assumptions underlying accruals for abandonment costs are too low, we could be required to expend greater amounts than expected.\nAlmost all of our producing properties are located offshore. The costs to abandon offshore wells may be substantial. For financial accounting purposes, we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and capitalize the related costs as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. The estimated liability is reflected as Asset retirement obligation in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAs part of the Etame field production license, we are subject to an agreed upon cash funding arrangement for the eventual abandonment of all offshore wells, platforms and facilities on the Etame Marin block. Based upon the abandonment study completed in January 2016, the abandonment cost estimate used for this purpose is approximately $61.1 million ($19.0 million net to our company) on an undiscounted basis. On an annual basis over the remaining life of the production license, we must fund a portion of these estimated abandonment costs. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Segment and Geographic Information -Gabon Segment-Etame Marin Block-Abandonment,\u201d for further information. Future changes to the anticipated abandonment cost estimates could change our asset retirement obligations and increase the amount of future abandonment funding payments we are obligated to make.\nWe operate in international jurisdictions and we could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government and other officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. Despite our training and compliance programs, we cannot be assured that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from acts of corruption committed by our employees or agents. Any additional expansion outside the U.S., including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations in the future. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDuring 2016, we were not in compliance with the New York Stock Exchange's average minimum market capitalization and minimum share price requirements, and have been at risk of the NYSE delisting our common stock, which could materially impair the liquidity and value of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NYSE. On August 9, 2016, we were notified by the NYSE that the average closing price of our common stock had fallen below $1.00 per share over a period of 30 consecutive trading days, which is the minimum average share price required by the NYSE. In addition, we received a notification from the NYSE on November 30, 2016 that our market capitalization had fallen below the NYSE\u2019s continued listing standard because our average market capitalization had fallen below $50 million over a trailing 30 trading-day period and our last reported stockholders\u2019 equity was less than $50 million.\nOn February 1, 2017, we announced that the NYSE had accepted our plan for compliance for continued listing, which extends 18 months through May 2018. As a result, our common stock will continue to be listed on the NYSE, subject to quarterly reviews by the NYSE\u2019s Listing and Compliance Committee to ensure our progress toward our plan to restore compliance with the continued listing standards.\nOur stock price has remained above $1.00 per share since December 14, 2016 and we regained compliance with the $1.00 requirement as of January 31, 2017. While our market capitalization has exceeded $50 million since December 5, 2016, we understand that we must maintain a market capitalization in excess of this requirement for at least two consecutive quarters prior to being deemed eligible for the NYSE to consider the company for an accelerated return to compliance.\nIf we are ultimately unable to regain compliance, the NYSE will commence suspension and delisting procedures. In the event that our common stock price falls below the $1.00 per share threshold and falls to a point where the NYSE considers the stock price to be \"abnormally low,\" the NYSE has the discretion to begin delisting procedures immediately. There is no formal definition of \"abnormally low\" in the NYSE rules.\nA delisting of our common stock could negatively impact us by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock, reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, and limiting our ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nCommodity derivatives transactions we enter into may fail to protect us from declines in commodity prices.\nIn order to reduce the impact of commodity price uncertainty and increase cash flow predictability relating to the marketing of our crude oil and natural gas, we may enter into derivatives arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. Our derivatives contracts consist of a series of put derivative instruments and are limited in duration. Our derivatives program may be inadequate to protect us from significant and prolonged declines in the price of crude oil.\nThe distressed financial conditions of one or more hedge providers could have an adverse impact on us in the event these hedge providers are unable to pay us amounts owed to us under one or more financial hedge transactions by which we have hedged our exposure to commodity price volatility.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into financial hedge transactions to hedge or mitigate our exposure to the risks of commodity price volatility with respect to the crude oil or natural gas we produce and sell. Similarly, some credit agreement facilities will require that we enter into financial hedges with creditworthy hedge providers for a percentage of our anticipated oil and natural gas production in order to ensure that we are able to make debt service payments under such credit facilities if oil and natural gas prices fall. In such instances, the hedge provider will be obligated to make payments to us under such financial hedge transactions to the extent that the floating (market) price is below an agreed fixed (strike) price. Hedging agreements expose us to risk of financial loss if the counterparty to a hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations. This risk of counterparty performance is of particular concern given the disruptions that have occurred in the financial markets that led to sudden changes in counterparty\u2019s liquidity and hence their ability to perform under their hedging contracts with us. We are unable to predict sudden changes in counterparty\u2019s creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if we do accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions. If the creditworthiness of our counterparties deteriorates and results in their nonperformance, we could incur a significant loss.\nThe enactment of derivatives legislation and the adoption of regulations thereunder could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce (hedge, manage or mitigate) the effect of commodity price, interest rate, and other risks associated with its business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), enacted in 2010, requires the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market, including swap clearing and trade execution requirements. While many rules and regulations have been promulgated and are already in effect, other rules and regulations, including the proposed position limits rule, remain to be finalized or effectuated, and therefore, the impact of those rules and regulations on us is uncertain at this time.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder, could (i) significantly increase the cost, or decrease the liquidity, of energy-related derivatives we use to hedge against commodity-price fluctuations (including through requirements to post collateral), (ii) materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, and (iii) reduce the availability and use of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and applicable rules and regulations, our cash flow may become more volatile and less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. In addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions, those transactions may become subject to such regulations. At this time, the impact of such regulations is not clear. Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes federal oversight and regulation of over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives and requires the CFTC and the SEC to enact further regulations affecting derivative contracts, including the derivative contracts we use to hedge our exposure to price volatility through the OTC market. Although the CFTC and the SEC have issued final regulations in certain areas, final rules in other areas and the scope of relevant definitions and/or exemptions still remain to be finalized.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax preferences currently available with respect to oil and natural gas production may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nIn recent years, the U.S. government\u2019s budget proposals and other proposed legislation have included the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production. If enacted into law, these proposals would eliminate certain tax preferences applicable to taxpayers engaged in the exploration or production of natural resources. These changes include, but are not limited to (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for U.S. production activities and (iv) the increase in the amortization period from two years to seven years for geophysical costs paid or incurred in connection with the exploration for or development of, oil and natural gas within the U.S. It is unclear whether any such changes will be enacted or how soon any such changes would become effective. While the passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could negatively impact our future taxable income in the U.S., we are currently not paying taxes in the U.S. as a result of tax benefits from foreign tax credits and net operating losses.\nWe may incur a significant penalty for failing to drill all the commitment wells under our production sharing contract in Angola.\nIn November 2006, we signed a production sharing contract for Block 5 offshore Angola. Under a production sharing agreement, we and our working interest partner, Sonangol P&P, the Angolan national oil company, were obligated to perform exploration activities in Angola that would result in drilling or commencing four wells by November 30, 2017; one well was drilled in 2015. Under the contract, we are required to pay a $5.0 million penalty for each of the three wells not completed. However, the penalty amounts may be reduced by exploration expenses incurred, and we believe that a substantial portion of the penalty amount may be reduced due to prior exploration expenditures. Support for our determination has been presented to Angola government authorities, and we anticipate further discussions on this matter.\nDue to the uncertainties as to the ultimate outcome, we have accrued a $15.0 million liability for the penalty, which represents what we believe to be the maximum potential amount due under the agreement. However, an unfavorable result on the resolution of the ultimate amount of the penalty could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThere are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud that could seriously harm our business may occur and not be detected.\nAs described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, our management concluded that control deficiencies in aggregate constituted a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. We determined that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting due to the failure to maintain a sufficient complement of corporate accounting and finance personnel necessary to consistently operate management review controls. We did not identify that the change in the complement of corporate accounting and finance personnel resulted in elevated risk that impacted our system of internal control, which in aggregate resulted in a material weakness. Controls were not operating effectively over the review and preparation of the financial statements. This material weakness resulted in adjustments prior to the issuance of the financial statements that, if not corrected, would have resulted in a material misstatement of the financial statements.\nIn 2016 management undertook a number of steps to remediate the material weakness. Implementation of these steps was adversely impacted by cost cutting and cost containment measures undertaken in the first half of 2016 in response to liquidity constraints resulting from an extended period of low oil prices. As disclosed in Note 2 to the Financial Statements, management determined that there was substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in the 2015 Form 10-K filed on March 16, 2016. Events and conditions improved during the year to such an extent that management concluded, as of March 13, 2017, that current events and conditions do not raise a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern through March 31, 2018. As a result of our focus on controlling costs and minimizing cash outlays, most of the actions taken in 2016 to remediate the material weakness (as described in \u201cRemediation of Material Weakness\u201d below), did not occur until the third and fourth quarters of 2016. These actions included replacement of accounting personnel in key positions and augmentation of the staff with additional professional resources. At December 31, 2016, management determined that the effectiveness and timeliness of the performance of controls related to the review of financial reports, the review of account reconciliations and the evaluation and reporting of significant and unusual transactions was not adequate to ensure that the material weakness in internal control identified in 2015 had been fully remediated. Management also determined that as of December 31, 2016 there is a material weakness related to the execution of the control for the physical observation of equipment which is performed annually to validate its existence.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, do not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, an evaluation of controls can only provide reasonable assurance that all material control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Further, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons or by collusion of two or more persons. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control\nsystem, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. A failure of our controls and procedures to detect error or fraud could seriously harm our business and results of operations.\nOur business could suffer if we lose the services of, or fail to attract, key personnel.\nWe are highly dependent upon the efforts of our senior management and other key employees. Our former chief executive officer, and former chief financial officer, resigned effective September 1, 2016 and June 2, 2016, respectively. On December 29, 2016, our Board of Directors appointed Cary Bounds, our Chief Operating Officer and Interim Chief Executive Officer, as our permanent Chief Executive Officer. Also on August 1, 2016, the Board designated Elizabeth Prochnow, our Controller and Chief Accounting Officer, as the Company\u2019s Principal Financial Officer. In addition, we have engaged a third-party consultant to serve as an interim Chief Financial Officer. The loss of the services of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as well as any loss of the services of one or more other members of our senior management, could delay or prevent the achievement of our objectives. We do not maintain any \"key-man\" insurance policies on any of our senior management, and do not intend to obtain such insurance. In addition, due to the specialized nature of our business, we are highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel with extensive experience and expertise in evaluating and analyzing drilling prospects and producing oil and natural gas from proved properties and maximizing production from oil and natural gas properties. There is competition for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities, and we may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining these personnel.", "PERMNO": 78841, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "EGY"}
