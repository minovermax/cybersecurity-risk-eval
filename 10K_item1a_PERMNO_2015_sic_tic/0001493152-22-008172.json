{"cik": "1534708", "company": "Eastside Distilling, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as our other disclosures in this Annual Report. We may have other risks that we have not yet identified or that we currently believe are immaterial but may become material.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nFailure to retain and recruit executive management and to build morale and improve performance could negatively impact our business.\nEastside Distilling\u2019s success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our executive management team, key senior management, and a high-quality employee base, as well as our ability to attract, motivate, reward, and retain them. If one of our executive officers or critical senior management terminates his or her employment, we may not be able to replace their expertise, fully integrate new personnel or replicate the prior working relationships. The loss of critical employees might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives. Qualified individuals with the breadth of skills and experience in our industry that we require are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. Difficulties in hiring or retaining key executive or employee talent, or the unexpected loss of experienced employees could have an adverse impact on our business performance. In addition, we could experience business disruption and/or increased costs related to organizational changes, reductions in workforce, or other cost-cutting measures. We recently experienced a significant change to our executive leadership team as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer resigned in February 2022.\nNegative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could reduce operational efficiency and reduce sales.\nOur business continues to be susceptible to disruption from any number of current and ongoing challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of consumer business and government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the operations and financial condition of many businesses. Those include employees being required to work remotely, not travel and otherwise alter their normal working conditions. Businesses have been closed and supply chains and manufacturing have been disrupted. Consumer buying habits have shifted and may continue to shift, which may result in fewer sales of our products. These and other impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and any other similar crisis could have a material impact on our operations and financial results.\nIn addition, our results and financial condition may be adversely affected by federal or state legislation (or other similar laws, regulations, orders or other governmental or regulatory actions) that would impose new or more severe restrictions on our ability to operate our business or impact the economy or our customers and suppliers, a severe downturn in the economy or financial and lending markets.\nThe degree to which COVID-19 may impact our results of operations and financial condition is unknown at this time and will depend on future developments, including the ultimate severity and the duration of the pandemic, and further actions that may be taken by governmental authorities or businesses or individuals on their own initiatives in response to the pandemic.\nWe expect to continue to produce net operating losses in 2022.\nWe believe that we will continue to incur net losses in 2022. We expect to continue to invest in product development, sales and marketing, and incur administrative expenses as we seek to grow our brands. We also anticipate that our operating and investing cash needs may exceed our income from sales in 2022. Some of our products may not achieve widespread market acceptance and may not generate sales and profits. Results of operations will depend upon numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including but not limited to new entrants, competitive activity, government regulations and increase in tax. We also incur substantial operating expenses at the corporate level, including costs directly related to being a reporting company with the SEC.\nWe may fail to secure additional capital and achieve adequate liquidity to grow and compete.\nWe will require additional capital to achieve the objectives our three-year strategic plan, which we outlined in 2021. This plan incorporates a strategy to rapidly expand our business activities, grow and compete in new markets. This plan requires substantial growth capital, of which we have only raised a portion. Failure to obtain additional capital could limit our operations and our growth and result in not meeting the objectives of the three-year plan. Historically, we have not generated sufficient cash from operations to finance additional capital needs, and thus we have used external sources of capital to fund operations. The source of these funds has included both private and public equity and/or debt financing. We cannot assure that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If additional capital is either unavailable or cost prohibitive, our operations and growth may be limited, and we may need to change our business strategy to slow the rate of, or eliminate, our expansion or to reduce or curtail our operations. Also, any additional financing we undertake could impose covenants upon us that restrict our operating flexibility. If we issue equity securities to raise capital, our existing shareholders may experience dilution and the new securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to effectively service and refinance debt.\nWe have incurred significant debt under promissory notes and inventory financing lines. Much of our debt is secured by our bulk spirits inventory and other assets, including assets in Craft C+B. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations depends upon our operating and financial performance, which is subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business, and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to service our debt, we may need to sell inventory and other material assets, restructure or refinance our debt, or seek additional equity capital. Prevailing economic conditions and global credit markets could adversely impact our ability to do so.\nOur debt agreements contain limits on our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, grant liens, undergo certain fundamental changes, make investments, and dispose of inventory. We are also required to maintain compliance with a total leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio, and for our secured inventory to have a market value relative to our outstanding debt balance.\nThe amount and terms of our debt, could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u25cf We may need to prematurely pay down our outstanding debt balance if the market value of our bulk spirits falls and we need to remain within our borrowing base covenants;\n\u25cf We may be more limited in our ability to execute on our strategy and have flexibility to operate or restructure our business;\n\u25cf Our cash flow from operations may be allocated to the payment of outstanding debt and not to developing and growing our brands;\n\u25cf We might not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or other sources to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the facility and to fund other liquidity needs;\n\u25cf We may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, less able to withstand competitive pressures, and less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions; or\n\u25cf We may be unable an inability to incur additional debt, including for working capital, acquisitions, or other needs.\nIf we breach a loan covenant or miss a payment, the lenders could accelerate the repayment of debt and foreclose on our inventory and other assets. We might not have sufficient assets to repay our debt upon acceleration. If we are unable to repay or refinance the debt upon acceleration or at maturity, the lenders could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding against us or collection proceedings with respect to our assets securing the facility, which could materially decrease the value of our common stock.\nFailure of our brands to achieve anticipated consumer acceptance would impact sales and profitability.\nMost of our brands are relatively new and have not achieved national brand recognition. We have not yet had success growing a brand to a sufficient level to realize corporate wide profitability. Also, brands we may develop and/or acquire in the future may not establish widespread brand recognition. Accordingly, if consumers do not accept our brands at scale, our sales will be limited, and we will not be able to penetrate our markets. Our profitability depends in part on achieving scale. We will need to achieve wider market acceptance of our brands and materially increase sales to achieve profitability.\nWe must obtain improved terms from our supply partner Agaveros Unidos de Amatitan, SA. de CV, which if not done, will likely result in deteriorating performance of our Azu\u00f1ia brand.\nWe have long-term exclusive agreement with Agaveros Unidos de Amatitan, SA. de CV (\u201cAgaveros Unidos\u201d) for the Azu\u00f1ia Tequila brand. The termination of our relationship or an adverse change in the terms of our arrangement with Agaveros Unidos could have a negative impact on our business. If Agaveros Unidos increases its prices, we may not be able to secure alternative suppliers, and may not be able to raise the prices of our products to cover all or even a portion of the increased costs. Also, its failure to perform satisfactorily or handle increased orders, or delays in shipping could cause us to fail to meet orders for our products, lose sales, incur additional costs and/or expose us to product quality issues. In turn, this could cause us to lose credibility in the marketplace and damage our relationships with distributors, ultimately leading to a decline in our business and results of operations. If we are not able to renegotiate these contracts on acceptable terms or find suitable alternatives, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nFailure of our distributors to distribute our products adequately within their territories or \u201cunder-invest\u201d in our brands could result in deteriorating operating performance.\nWe are required by law to use state-licensed distributors or, in 17 states known as \u201ccontrol states,\u201d state-owned agencies performing this function, to sell our products to retail outlets, including liquor stores, bars, restaurants and national chains in the United States. We have established relationships for our brands with a limited number of wholesale distributors; however, failure to maintain those relationships could significantly and adversely affect our business, sales and growth. We currently distribute our spirits in 34 states.\nOver the past decade there has been increasing consolidation in production, distribution, and retail (the three tiers of the current system) that challenges the growth of small businesses in the marketplace. Our distributors also distribute competitive brands for much larger companies with significant pricing power. The ultimate success of our products depends in large part on our distributors\u2019 ability and desire to distribute our products, as we rely significantly on them for product placement and retail store penetration. In many key states, we have signed contracts that greatly limit our ability to replace and pursue recourse with distributor partners that fail to meet their obligations. We cannot assure you that our U.S. distributors will commit sufficient time and resources to promote and market our brands and product lines. If they do not, our sales will be harmed, resulting in a decline in our results of operations.\nFailure of our products to secure and maintain listings in the control states would result in a decline in revenue.\nIn the control states, the state liquor commissions act in place of distributors and decide which products are to be purchased and offered for sale in their respective states. Products selected for listing in control states must generally reach certain sales volumes and/or profit levels to maintain their listings. Products in control states are selected for purchase and sale through listing procedures, which are generally made available to new products only at periodically scheduled listing interviews. Products not selected for listings can only be purchased by consumers in the applicable control state through special orders, if at all. If, in the future, we are unable to maintain our current listings in the control states, or secure and maintain listings in those states for any additional products we may develop or acquire, sales of our products could decrease significantly, which would have a material adverse financial effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to maintain adequate inventory levels would negatively impact operational profitability.\nWe maintain inventories of our product aging in barrels, as well as, to meet customer delivery requirements. We have used our barreled spirits inventory at market value as collateral in our financing. If we do not make timely payments on our financing obligations, or we breach our covenants in any financing document, including maintaining loan-to-value ratios, the lenders may foreclose and take possession of our inventory. In addition, this inventory is always at risk of loss due to theft, fire, evaporation, spoilage, or other damage, and any such loss, whether insured against or not, could cause us to fail to meet our orders and harm our sales and operating results. Also, our inventory may become obsolete as we introduce new products, cease to produce old products or modify the design of our products\u2019 packaging, which would increase our operating losses and negatively impact our results of operations.\nFailure to integrate acquired operating assets, brands, or products that are complementary to our existing portfolio would result in deteriorating efficiency.\nA component of our growth strategy will be the acquisition of additional brands that are complementary to our existing portfolio through the acquisition of such brands or their corporate owners, directly as brand acquisitions or through mergers, joint ventures, long-term exclusive distribution arrangements and/or other strategic relationships. If we are unable to identify or have the financial ability to acquire suitable brand candidates and successfully execute our acquisition strategy, our growth will be limited. In addition, our entry into and expansion of our contract bottling, canning, and packaging services may not be successful, and we may not realize the benefits of these co-packing operations and may face certain risks, including safety concerns, product contamination, and equipment malfunctions or breakdowns, among other things associated with our manufacturing operations.\nIf we are successful in acquiring additional brands or related service businesses, we may still fail to achieve our target margins or maintain profitability levels that would justify our investment in those additional brands or services or fail to realize operating and economic efficiencies or other planned benefits with respect to those additional brands or services.\nThe addition of new products or businesses entails numerous risks with respect to integration and other operating issues, any of which could have a detrimental effect on our results of operations and/or the value of our equity. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf difficulties in assimilating acquired operations or products, including failure to realize synergies;\n\u25cf failure to realize or anticipate benefits or to execute on our planned strategy for the acquired brand or business;\n\u25cf unanticipated costs that could materially adversely affect our results of operations;\n\u25cf negative effects on reported results of operations from acquisition-related charges and amortization of acquired intangibles;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u25cf adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers, distributors and retail customers;\n\u25cf risks of entering new markets or markets in which we have limited prior experience; and\n\u25cf the potential inability to retain and motivate key employees of acquired businesses.\nOur ability to grow through the acquisition of additional brands is also dependent upon identifying acceptable acquisition targets and opportunities, our ability to consummate prospective transactions on favorable terms, or at all, and the availability of capital to complete the necessary acquisition arrangements. We intend to finance our brand acquisitions through a combination of our available cash resources, third-party financing and, in appropriate circumstances, the further issuance of equity and/or debt securities. Acquiring additional brands could have a significant effect on our financial position and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly operating results. Also, acquisitions could result in the recording of significant goodwill and intangible assets on our financial statements, the amortization or impairment of which would reduce reported earnings in subsequent years.\nFailure to protect our customer relationships, trademarks and trade secrets from competitors would result in increased competition.\nOur business and prospects depend in part on our ability to develop and retain customers as well as cultivate favorable consumer recognition of our brands and trademarks. Although we apply for registration of our brands and trademarks, they could be imitated in ways that we cannot prevent. Also, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how, concepts and formulas. Our methods of protecting this information may not be adequate. Moreover, we may face claims of misappropriation or infringement of third parties\u2019 rights that could interfere with our use of this information. Defending these claims may be costly and, if unsuccessful, may prevent us from continuing to use this proprietary information in the future and result in a judgment or monetary damages being levied against us. We do not maintain non-competition agreements with all of our key personnel or with some of our key suppliers. If competitors independently develop or otherwise obtain access to our trade secrets, proprietary know-how or recipes, the appeal, and thus the value, of our brand portfolio could be reduced, negatively impacting our sales and growth potential.\nWe are susceptible to cyber-security breaches and cyber-related fraud.\nWe rely on information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems, networks, and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools, hardware (including laptops and mobile devices), and software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors, to assist us in the management of our business.\nIncreased IT security threats and more sophisticated cyber-crime pose a potential risk to the security of our IT systems, networks, and services, as well as to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. If the IT systems, networks, or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or if we suffer a loss or disclosure of business or other sensitive information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations and reputational, competitive and/or business harm, which may adversely affect our business operations and/or financial condition. In addition, such events could result in unauthorized disclosure of material confidential information, and we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, our employees, customers, suppliers, or consumers. In any of these events, we could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and IT systems.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY\nDemand for our products may be adversely affected by consumer taste changes affecting category trends.\nConsumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including changes in demographic and social trends, public health initiatives, product innovations, changes in vacation or leisure, dining and beverage consumption patterns and a downturn in economic conditions, any or all of which may reduce consumers\u2019 willingness to purchase distilled spirits or cause a shift in consumer preferences toward beer, wine or non-alcoholic beverages or other products. Our success depends in part on fulfilling available opportunities to meet consumer needs and anticipating changes in consumer preferences with successful new products and product innovations.\nIn addition, the legalization of marijuana in any of the jurisdictions in which we sell our products may result in a reduction in sales. Studies have shown that sales of alcohol may decrease in jurisdictions where marijuana has been legalized. As a result, marijuana sales may adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nWe face substantial competition in our industry and have limited financial resources compared to other competitors.\nWe compete on the basis of product taste and quality, brand image, price, service and ability to innovate in response to consumer preferences. The global spirits industry is highly competitive and is dominated by several large, well-funded international companies. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories and have substantially greater financial, sales, marketing and other resources than we do, as well as larger installed customer bases, greater name recognition and broader product offerings. Some of these competitors can devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products. As a result, it is possible that our competitors may either respond to industry conditions or consumer trends more rapidly or effectively or resort to price competition to sustain market share, which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nWe face unique risks relating to class actions or other litigation relating to alcohol abuse or the misuse of alcohol.\nOur industry faces the possibility of class action or similar litigation alleging that the continued excessive use or abuse of beverage alcohol has caused death or serious health problems or that we failed to adequately warn consumers of the risks of alcohol consumption. It is also possible that governments could assert that the use of alcohol has significantly increased government-funded healthcare costs. Litigation or assertions of this type have adversely affected companies in the tobacco industry, and it is possible that we, as well as our suppliers, could be named in litigation of this type.\nLawsuits have been brought in a number of states alleging that beverage alcohol manufacturers and marketers have improperly targeted underage consumers in their advertising. Plaintiffs in these cases allege that the defendants\u2019 advertisements, marketing and promotions violate the consumer protection or deceptive trade practices statutes in each of these states and seek repayment of the family funds expended by the underage consumers. While we have not been named in these lawsuits, we could be named in similar lawsuits in the future. Any class action or other litigation asserted against us could be expensive and time-consuming to defend against, depleting our cash and diverting our personnel resources and, if the plaintiffs in such actions were to prevail, our business could be harmed significantly.\nWe face substantial regulatory risks including compliance with local and national laws, legal, regulatory and tax changes.\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation. This includes regulations regarding production, distribution, marketing, advertising and labeling of beverage alcohol products. We are required to comply with these regulations and to maintain various permits and licenses. We are also required to conduct business only with holders of licenses to import, warehouse, transport, distribute and sell beverage alcohol products. We cannot assure you that these and other governmental regulations applicable to our industry will not change or become more stringent. Moreover, because these laws and regulations are subject to interpretation, we may not be able to predict when and to what extent liability may arise. Additionally, due to increasing public concern over alcohol-related societal problems, including driving while intoxicated, underage drinking, alcoholism and health consequences from the abuse of alcohol, various levels of government may seek to impose additional restrictions or limits on advertising or other marketing activities promoting beverage alcohol products. Failure to comply with any of the current or future regulations and requirements relating to our industry and products could result in monetary penalties, suspension or even revocation of our licenses and permits. Costs of compliance with changes in regulations could be significant and could harm our business, as we could find it necessary to raise our prices in order to maintain profit margins, which could lower the demand for our products and reduce our sales and profit potential.\nAlso, the distribution of beverage alcohol products is subject to extensive taxation (at both the federal and state government levels), and beverage alcohol products themselves are the subject of national import and excise duties in most countries around the world. An increase in taxation or in import or excise duties could also significantly harm our sales revenue and margins, both through the reduction of overall consumption and by encouraging consumers to switch to lower-taxed categories of beverage alcohol.\nWe are exposed to product liability or other related liabilities which could have significant negative financial repercussions on the Company\u2019s solvency.\nAlthough we maintain liability insurance and will attempt to limit contractually our liability for damages arising from consumer, stakeholder and other lawsuits, these measures may not be sufficient for us to successfully avoid or limit product liability or other related liabilities. Our product liability insurance coverage is limited to $1 million per occurrence and $3 million in the aggregate and $2 million products/completed operations aggregate, and our general liability umbrella policy is limited to $5 million per occurrence and $5 million in the aggregate and $5 million products/completed operations aggregate. We do not have insurance covering employee lawsuits. Further, any contractual indemnification and insurance coverage we have from parties supplying our products is limited, as a practical matter, to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by these suppliers. In any event, extensive product liability claims could be costly to defend and/or costly to resolve and could harm our reputation or business.\nWe could face issues including the risk of contamination of our products and/or counterfeit or confusingly similar products.\nThe success of our brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of them. Contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for our brands, could affect the demand for our products. Contaminants in raw materials purchased from third parties and used in the production of our products or defects in the distillation and fermentation processes could lead to low beverage quality, as well as illness among, or injury to, consumers of our products and could result in reduced sales of the affected brand or all of our brands and potentially serious damage to our reputation for product quality, as well as product liability claims. Also, to the extent that third parties sell products that are either counterfeit versions of our brands or brands that look like our brands, consumers of our brands could confuse our products with products that they consider inferior. This could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our sales and operations.\nIn addition, we also provide contract bottling, canning, and packaging services for existing and emerging beer, wine and spirits producers. Beer and wine products produced by third parties may be more susceptible to contamination than the distilled products that we produce, due to the lower alcohol content.\nWe have incurred substantial turnover in employees over the past few years, which has negatively affected operating performance.\nOver the past two years, we have embarked on a restructuring of operations to improve our financial performance. As a result, management has experienced a significant amount of employee turnover. In addition, we have reduced the total number of employees of the firm. This reduced headcount had negatively impacted performance in a number of ways. If this level of turnover continues, we could face operational challenges that would negatively impact financial performance.\nWe operate with an Interim CEO and CFO, which could have a negative impact on financial performance.\nIn February 2022, the CEO resigned and was replaced by the CFO. Operating with a single person as both Interim CEO and CFO adds risk to the operating performance given the complexity of our business. If we are unsuccessful retaining and/or recruiting executives, we may face negative operating performance.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nSales of our stock or use of our common stock to satisfy obligations may impact the market price and cause substantial dilution to existing shareholders.\nWe will need to raise additional capital, which might be in the form of an equity offering. Future sales of substantial amounts of our common or preferred stock, including shares that we may issue upon exercise of warrants or conversion of preferred stock, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Further, if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and cause substantial dilution to current stockholders.\nWe pay certain of our directors, consultants and business partners in our common stock or other securities linked to our common stock, and sometimes settle debts with common stock. Continued use of our stock in this manner, especially if our stock price is trading at a low price, may cause dilution to our shareholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nA decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise working capital and finance our operations.\nA further decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. A decline in the price of our common stock could be especially detrimental to our liquidity and our operations. Such reductions may force us to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may have a significant negative effect on our business plans and operations, including our ability to develop new services and continue our current operations. If our common stock price further declines, we can offer no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital or generate funds from operations sufficient to meet our obligations. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital in the future, we may not be able to have the resources to continue our normal operations.\nIf we are unable to continue as a going concern, our securities will have little or no value.\nWe have incurred operating losses since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm included in its audit report for the year ended December 31, 2021 an explanatory paragraph referring to our net loss from operations and accumulated deficit and expressing substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern without additional capital becoming available. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or obtain additional financing in the future, we might not be able to continue as a going concern. There are no assurances that such financing, if necessary, will be available to us at all or will be available in sufficient amounts or on reasonable terms. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If we are unable to generate additional funds in the future through financings, sales of our products or from other sources or transactions, we will exhaust our resources and will be unable to continue operations. If we cannot continue as a going concern, our stockholders would likely lose most or all of their investment in us.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting which would result in the loss of shareholder\u2019s capital.\nIn August 2017, our shares of common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, such as the minimum closing bid price requirement, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we would expect to take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements.\nWhile our derivatives are outstanding, it may be more difficult to raise additional equity capital to fund operations.\nWe currently have non-trading, privately issued common stock warrants to purchase shares of common stock, certain debt and preferred shares that are convertible into common stock. During the terms that our derivatives are outstanding, the holders will be given the opportunity to profit if there is a rise in the market price of our common stock. We may find it more difficult to raise additional equity capital while we have these derivatives outstanding. We might issue additional derivatives along with a future financing.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nFor the foreseeable future, it is anticipated that earnings, if any, that may be generated from our operations will be used to finance our operations and that cash dividends will not be paid to holders of common stock.\nBy issuing preferred stock, we may adversely affect the market price and voting rights of common shareholders.\nOur Articles of Incorporation permit us to issue, without approval from our stockholders, a total of 100 million shares of preferred stock. Our Board may determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to, or imposed upon, the shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series. It is possible that our Board, in determining the rights, preferences and privileges to be granted when the preferred stock is issued, may include provisions that have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price, or that adversely affect the market price of and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 16887, "SIC": 2085, "TIC": "EAST"}
