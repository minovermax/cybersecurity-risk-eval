{"cik": "47111", "company": "HERSHEY CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully read the following discussion of significant factors, events and uncertainties when evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, these risk factors do not identify all the risks we face, and there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be significant that may have a material adverse effect on our business, performance or financial condition in the future.\nRisk Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\nOur business and financial results may be negatively impacted by the failure to successfully manage a disruption in consumer and trade patterns, as well as operational challenges associated with the actual or perceived effects of a disease outbreak, including epidemics, pandemics or similar widespread public health concerns, such as, the current coronavirus disease 2019 (\"COVID-19\") global pandemic.\nOur operations are impacted by consumer spending levels, impulse purchases, the availability of our products at retail and our ability to manufacture, store and distribute products to our customers and consumers in an effective and efficient manner. The fear of exposure to or actual effects of a disease outbreak, epidemic, pandemic or similar widespread public health concern, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could negatively impact our overall business and financial results. Specific factors that may impact our operations, some of which have had an unfavorable impact on our operations as a result of COVID-19, include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022Significant reductions or volatility in demand for one or more of our products, which may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, or financial hardship, shifts in demand away from one or more of our products, or pantry-loading activity; if prolonged, such impacts may further increase the difficulty of planning for operations and may negatively impact our results;\n\u2022Significant reductions in the availability of one or more of our products as a result of retailers, common carriers or other shippers modifying restocking, fulfillment and shipping practices;\n\u2022The inability to meet our customers\u2019 needs and achieve cost targets due to disruptions in our manufacturing operations or supply arrangements caused by the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or finished product components, transportation resources, workforce availability, or other manufacturing and distribution capability;\n\u2022The inability to effectively manage evolving health and welfare strategies, including but not limited to ongoing or not yet fully known costs related to operational adjustments to ensure continued employee and consumer safety and adherence to health guidelines as they are modified and supplemented;\n\u2022An inability to effectively modify our trade promotion and advertising activities to reflect changing consumer viewing and shopping habits due to the cancellation or postponement of major sporting and entertainment events, reduced in-store visits, travel restrictions and a shift in customer advertising priorities, among other things;\n\u2022The failure of third parties on which we rely, including those third parties who supply our ingredients, packaging, capital equipment and other necessary operating materials, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors, commercial banks and external business partners, to meet their obligations to the Company, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties and may negatively impact our operations; or\n\u2022Significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products, including quarantines, governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our employees\u2019 ability to travel or perform necessary business functions, or otherwise prevent our third-party partners, suppliers, or customers from sufficiently\nThe Hershey Company | 2020 Form 10-K | Page 8\nstaffing operations, including operations necessary for the production, distribution, sale, and support of our products, which could negatively impact our results.\nWith respect to COVID-19, the situation remains dynamic and subject to rapid and possibly material change. The Company's efforts to manage and mitigate these factors may be unsuccessful, and the effectiveness of these efforts depends on factors beyond our control, including the duration and severity of any disease outbreak, as well as third-party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate public health effects.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nOur Company\u2019s reputation or brand image might be impacted as a result of issues or concerns relating to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging, human and workplace rights, and other environmental, social or governance matters, which in turn could result in litigation or otherwise negatively impact our operating results.\nIn order to sell our iconic, branded products, we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers, consumers, suppliers, vendors and employees, among others. Issues related to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our Company\u2019s image and reputation. We have in the past and may in the future need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption. Negative publicity related to these types of concerns, or related to product contamination or product tampering, whether valid or not, could decrease demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. In addition, negative publicity related to our environmental, social or governance practices could also impact our reputation with customers, consumers, suppliers and vendors.\nWe have in the past and in the future could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions as a result of issues or concerns relating to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging, human and workplace rights, and other environmental, social or governance matters, which could result in payments of fines or damages. Costs associated with these potential actions, as well as the potential impact on our reputation or ability to sell our products, could negatively affect our operating results.\nDisruption to our manufacturing operations or supply chain could impair our ability to produce or deliver finished products, resulting in a negative impact on our operating results.\nApproximately 72% of our manufacturing capacity is located in the United States. Disruption to our global manufacturing operations or our supply chain could result from, among other factors, the following:\n\u2022Natural disaster;\n\u2022Pandemic outbreak of disease;\n\u2022Climate change and severity of extreme weather;\n\u2022Fire or explosion;\n\u2022Terrorism or other acts of violence;\n\u2022Labor strikes or other labor activities;\n\u2022Unavailability of raw or packaging materials;\n\u2022Operational and/or financial instability of key suppliers, and other vendors or service providers; and\n\u2022Suboptimal production planning which could impact our ability to cost-effectively meet product demand.\nWe believe that we take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions. We have strategies and plans in place to manage disruptive events if they were to occur, including our global supply chain strategies and our principle-based global labor relations strategy. If we are unable, or find that it is not financially feasible, to effectively plan for, mitigate or manage operational stability and business resiliency, particularly within our international markets and snacks portfolio, due to the potential impacts of such disruptive events on our manufacturing operations or supply chain, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if such events were to occur.\nThe Hershey Company | 2020 Form 10-K | Page 9\nWe might not be able to hire, engage and retain the talented global workforce we need to drive our growth strategies.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to identify, hire, develop, engage and retain talented personnel across the globe. Competition for global talent is intense, and we might not be able to identify and hire the personnel we need to continue to evolve and grow our business. In particular, if we are unable to hire the right individuals to fill new or existing senior management positions as vacancies arise, our business performance may be impacted.\nActivities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring and integrating qualified individuals require significant time and attention. We may also need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract talented new employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments.\nIn addition to hiring new employees, we must continue to focus on retaining and engaging the talented individuals we need to sustain our core business and lead our developing businesses into new markets, channels and categories. This may require significant investments in training, coaching and other career development and retention activities. If we are not able to effectively retain and grow our talent, our ability to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely affected, which may impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Industry in Which We Operate\nIncreases in raw material and energy costs along with the availability of adequate supplies of raw materials could affect future financial results.\nWe use many different commodities for our business, including cocoa products, sugar, corn products, dairy products, peanuts, almonds, natural gas and diesel fuel.\nCommodities are subject to price volatility and changes in supply caused by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022Commodity market fluctuations;\n\u2022Currency exchanges rates;\n\u2022Imbalances between supply and demand;\n\u2022The effects of climate change and extreme weather on crop yield and quality;\n\u2022Speculative influences;\n\u2022Trade agreements among producing and consuming nations;\n\u2022Supplier compliance with commitments;\n\u2022Import/export requirements for raw materials and finished goods;\n\u2022Political unrest in producing countries;\n\u2022Introduction of living income premiums or similar requirements; and\n\u2022Changes in governmental agricultural programs and energy policies.\nAlthough we use forward contracts and commodity futures and options contracts where possible to hedge commodity prices, commodity price increases ultimately result in corresponding increases in our raw material and energy costs. If we are unable to offset cost increases for major raw materials and energy, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nPrice increases may not be sufficient to offset cost increases and maintain profitability or may result in sales volume declines associated with pricing elasticity.\nWe may be able to pass some or all raw material, energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products; however, higher product prices or decreased product sizes may also result in a reduction in sales volume and/or consumption. If we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes sufficiently, or in a timely manner, to offset increased raw material, energy or other input costs, including packaging, freight, direct labor, overhead and employee benefits, or if our sales volume decreases significantly, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Hershey Company | 2020 Form 10-K | Page 10\nMarket demand for new and existing products could decline.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products. To generate revenues and profits, we must sell products that appeal to our customers and to consumers. Our continued success is impacted by many factors, including the following:\n\u2022Effective retail execution;\n\u2022Appropriate advertising campaigns and marketing programs;\n\u2022Our ability to secure adequate shelf space at retail locations;\n\u2022Our ability to drive sustainable innovation and maintain a strong pipeline of new products in the confectionery and broader snacking categories;\n\u2022Changes in product category consumption;\n\u2022Our response to consumer demographics and trends, including but not limited to, trends relating to store trips and the impact of the growing digital commerce channel; and\n\u2022Consumer health concerns, including obesity and the consumption of certain ingredients.\nThere continues to be competitive product and pricing pressures in the markets where we operate, as well as challenges in maintaining profit margins. We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including retailers and distributors, to compete effectively. Our largest customer, McLane Company, Inc., accounted for approximately 31% of our total net sales in 2020. McLane Company, Inc. is one of the largest wholesale distributors in the United States to convenience stores, drug stores, wholesale clubs and mass merchandisers, including Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.\nIncreased marketplace competition could hurt our business.\nThe global confectionery packaged goods industry is intensely competitive and consolidation in this industry continues. Some of our competitors are large companies that have significant resources and substantial international operations. We continue to experience increased levels of in-store activity for other snack items, which has pressured confectionery category growth. In order to protect our existing market share or capture increased market share in this highly competitive retail environment, we may be required to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising, and must continue to introduce and establish new products. Due to inherent risks in the marketplace associated with advertising and new product introductions, including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance, increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits. In addition, we may incur increased credit and other business risks because we operate in a highly competitive retail environment.\nRisks Related to Strategic Initiatives\nOur financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures.\nFrom time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives. The success of such activity depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable buyers, sellers or business partners; perform effective assessments prior to contract execution; negotiate contract terms; and, if applicable, obtain government approval. These activities may present certain financial, managerial, staffing and talent, and operational risks, including diversion of management\u2019s attention from existing core businesses; difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations; and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made. If the acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Hershey Company | 2020 Form 10-K | Page 11\nIn 2020, we successfully completed the divestitures of Krave and the Scharffen Berger and Dagoba brands as we better prioritize resources against assets and brands that fit our business model and scale capabilities. Additionally, over the last several years, we have continued to invest in our snacks portfolio, specifically with the acquisitions of ONE Brands, LLC in September 2019, Pirate Brands in October 2018 and Amplify Snack Brands, Inc. in January 2018, respectively. While we believe significant operating synergies can be obtained in connection with these acquisitions, achievement of these synergies will be driven by our ability to successfully leverage Hershey's resources, expertise, capability-building, distribution locations and customer base. In addition, these acquisitions are important steps in our journey to expand our breadth in snacking, as they should enable us to bring scale and category management capabilities to a key sub-segment of the warehouse snack aisle. If we are unable to successfully couple Hershey\u2019s scale and expertise in brand building with ONE Brands, Pirate Brands and Amplify's existing operations, it may impact our ability to expand our snacking footprint at our desired pace.\nOur international operations may not achieve projected growth objectives, which could adversely impact our overall business and results of operations.\nIn 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, we derived approximately 13.6%, 15.8% and 16.1% of our net sales from customers located outside of the United States. Additionally, approximately 20% of our total long-lived assets were located outside of the United States as of December 31, 2020. As part of our strategy, we have made investments outside of the United States, particularly in Canada, Malaysia, Mexico, Brazil and India. As a result, we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations, including:\n\u2022The inability to manage operational stability and business resiliency within our international markets due to unforeseen global economic and environmental changes resulting in business interruption, supply constraints, inflation, deflation or decreased demand;\n\u2022The inability to establish, develop and achieve market acceptance of our global brands in international markets;\n\u2022Difficulties and costs associated with compliance and enforcement of remedies under a wide variety of complex laws, treaties and regulations;\n\u2022Unexpected changes in regulatory environments;\n\u2022Political and economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, terrorism, mass violence or armed conflict;\n\u2022Nationalization of our properties by foreign governments;\n\u2022Tax rates that may exceed those in the United States and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements and incremental taxes upon repatriation;\n\u2022Potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;\n\u2022The imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022Increased costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation;\n\u2022The impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies;\n\u2022Failure to gain sufficient profitable scale in certain international markets resulting in an inability to cover manufacturing fixed costs or resulting in losses from impairment or sale of assets; and\n\u2022Failure to recruit, retain and build a talented and engaged global workforce.\nIf we are not able to achieve our projected international growth objectives and mitigate the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our international operations, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Hershey Company | 2020 Form 10-K | Page 12\nWe may not fully realize the expected costs savings and/or operating efficiencies associated with our strategic initiatives or restructuring programs, which may have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe depend on our ability to evolve and grow, and as changes in our business environment occur, we may adjust our business plans by introducing new strategic initiatives or restructuring programs to meet these changes. Recently introduced strategic initiatives include our efforts to continue to expand our presence in digital commerce, to transform our manufacturing, commercial and corporate operations through digital technologies and to enhance our data analytics capabilities to develop new commercial insights. If we are not able to capture our share of the expanding digital commerce market, if we do not adequately leverage technology to improve operating efficiencies or if we are unable to develop the data analytics capabilities needed to generate actionable commercial insights, our business performance may be impacted, which may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, from time to time we implement business realignment activities to support key strategic initiatives designed to maintain long-term sustainable growth, such as the International Optimization Program, which we commenced in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the Margin for Growth Program we commenced in the first quarter of 2017 and subsequently completed in mid-2020. These programs are intended to increase our operating effectiveness and efficiency, to reduce our costs and/or to generate savings that can be reinvested in other areas of our business. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully implement these strategic initiatives and restructuring programs, that we will achieve or sustain the intended benefits under these programs, or that the benefits, even if achieved, will be adequate to meet our long-term growth and profitability expectations, which could in turn adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Governmental and Regulatory Changes\nChanges in governmental laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities or impact demand for our products.\nChanges in laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied may alter our business environment. These negative impacts could result from changes in food and drug laws, laws related to advertising and marketing practices, accounting standards, taxation requirements, competition laws, employment laws, import/export requirements and environmental laws, among others. It is possible that we could become subject to additional liabilities in the future resulting from changes in laws and regulations that could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nPolitical, economic and/or financial market conditions could negatively impact our financial results.\nOur operations are impacted by consumer spending levels and impulse purchases, which are affected by general macroeconomic conditions, consumer confidence, employment levels, the availability of consumer credit and interest rates on that credit, consumer debt levels, energy costs and other factors. Volatility in food and energy costs, sustained global recessions, broad political instability, rising unemployment, pandemic outbreak of disease, climate change, weather, natural and other disasters and declines in personal spending could adversely impact our revenues, profitability and financial condition.\nChanges in financial market conditions may make it difficult to access credit markets on commercially acceptable terms, which may reduce liquidity or increase borrowing costs for our Company, our customers and our suppliers. A significant reduction in liquidity could increase counterparty risk associated with certain suppliers and service providers, resulting in disruption to our supply chain and/or higher costs, and could impact our customers, resulting in a reduction in our revenue, or a possible increase in bad debt expense.\nThe Hershey Company | 2020 Form 10-K | Page 13\nRisks Related to Digital Transformation, Cybersecurity and Data Privacy\nDisruptions, failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a negative impact on our operations.\nInformation technology is critically important to our business operations. We use information technology to manage all business processes including manufacturing, financial, logistics, sales, marketing and administrative functions. These processes collect, interpret and distribute business data and communicate internally and externally with employees, suppliers, customers and others.\nWe are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats. Therefore, we continuously monitor and update our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact. We invest in industry standard security technology to protect the Company\u2019s data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber attack. Our data security management program includes identity, trust, vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies. We measure our data security effectiveness through industry-accepted methods and remediate significant findings. Additionally, we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification standards. We maintain and routinely test backup systems and disaster recovery, along with external network security penetration testing by an independent third party as part of our business resiliency preparedness. We also have processes in place to prevent disruptions resulting from our implementation of new software and systems.\nWhile we have been subject to cyber attacks and other security breaches, these incidents did not have a significant impact on our business operations. We believe our security technology tools and processes provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and in reducing cybersecurity risks. Nevertheless, despite continued vigilance in these areas, disruptions in or failures of information technology systems are possible and could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation. Failure of our systems, including failures due to cyber attacks that would prevent the ability of systems to function as intended, could cause transaction errors, loss of customers and sales, and could have negative consequences to our Company, our employees and those with whom we do business. This in turn could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results or operations. In addition, the cost to remediate any damages to our information technology systems suffered as a result of a cyber attack could be significant.\nComplications with the design or implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system could adversely impact our business and operations.\nWe rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results. We are in the process of a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system. This ERP system will replace our existing operating and financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain the Company\u2019s financial records, enhance operational functionality and provide timely information to the Company\u2019s management team related to the operation of the business. The ERP system implementation process has required, and will continue to require, the investment of significant personnel and financial resources. We may not be able to successfully implement the ERP system without experiencing further delays, increased costs and other difficulties. We selectively paused certain aspects of the ERP system implementation due to resource constraints and challenges associated with the critical design phase during these uncertain times. We expect this to delay our overall ERP implementation by approximately one year. If we are unable to successfully design and implement the new ERP system as planned, our financial positions, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if we do not effectively implement the ERP system as planned or the ERP system does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess those controls adequately could be further delayed.", "PERMNO": 16600, "SIC": 2060, "TIC": "HSY"}
