Risk Factors\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s common shares involves certain risks. The following is a discussion of material risks that may affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and future results.\nRisks Related to COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant global economic downturn which has, and is expected to, continue to adversely affect our business and results of operations, and the future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition remain uncertain.\nCOVID-19, which has been identified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization, continues to cause economic disruption both worldwide and in the markets in which we operate. The ultimate impacts of COVID-19 are uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. The extent of these impacts will depend on future developments, including among others, governmental, regulatory, and private sector actions and responses, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, and actions taken to contain or prevent further spread, each of which and cannot be predicted.\nOur business is dependent upon the ability and willingness of our clients to conduct banking and other financial transactions, including the payment of loan obligations. COVID-19 has and continues to disrupt the business, activities, and operations of our clients, which may result in a decline in demand for our products and services, which may, in turn, result in a significant decrease in our business, negatively impacting our liquidity position and financial results and cause increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures, declining collateral values, and other losses. Moreover, current and future governmental action may temporarily require us to conduct business differently with respect to collection actions, deferrals, and other client-related transactions.\nOur workforce has been, is, and may continue to be, impacted by COVID-19. We are taking precautions to protect the safety and well-being of our employees and clients, including the use of personal protective equipment and aligning our operations with state and local guidelines for businesses, but no assurance can be given that our actions will be adequate or appropriate. The spread of COVID-19 could also negatively impact availability of key personnel and employee productivity, as well as the business and operations of third-party service providers who perform critical services for us, which could adversely impact our ability to deliver products and services to our clients.\nRisks Relating to the Industry and Geography in Which We Operate\nAs a business operating in the financial services industry, our business and operations may be adversely affected by weak economic conditions.\nOur business operations, which primarily consist of lending money to clients in the form of loans, borrowing money from clients in the form of deposits and investing in securities, are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. If the U.S. economy weakens, our growth and profitability from our lending, deposit and investment operations could be constrained. Uncertainty about the\nfederal fiscal policymaking process, the short-term and long-term fiscal outlook of the federal economy, the extent and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and future tax rates is a concern for businesses, consumers, and investors in the United States. In addition, economic conditions in foreign countries could affect the stability of global financial markets, which could hinder U.S. economic growth. Our business is also significantly affected by monetary and related policies of the U.S. federal government and its agencies. Changes in any of these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond our control. Adverse economic conditions and government policy responses to such conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nOur loans and operations are primarily in Utah, Salt Lake, Davis, Cache, Box Elder and Washington Counties; therefore, our business is particularly vulnerable to a downturn in the local economies of those counties.\nUnlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, our business is concentrated primarily in the state of Utah. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 84% of our loans were secured by real estate, the majority of which are located in Utah, Salt Lake, Davis, Cache, Box Elder, and Washington counties. If the local economy, and particularly the real estate market, declines, the rates of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures, bankruptcies and losses in our loan portfolio would likely increase. This risk increases for our variable rate loans, which represent 70% of our loans. A downturn in the local economy generally and real estate market specifically could significantly reduce our profitability and growth and adversely affect our financial condition and operations.\nA large portion of our loan portfolio is tied to the real estate market and we may be negatively impacted by downturns in that market.\nThe majority of loans in our portfolio are real estate related, consisting of loans for construction and land development projects, and for the purchase, improvement or refinancing of residential and commercial real estate. A downturn in the real estate market could increase loan delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures, and significantly impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the client and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. If real estate values decline, it is also more likely that we would be required to increase our allowance for credit losses. If during a period of reduced real estate values we are required to liquidate the property collateralizing a loan to satisfy the debt or to increase our allowance for credit losses, it could materially reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 13.4% of our loan portfolio consisted of real estate construction, and acquisition and land development loans, which generally have a higher degree of risk than long-term financing of existing properties because repayment depends on the completion of the project and usually on the sale or long term financing of the property. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, an impact on the ability of our clients to complete these projects on time and within budget, particularly with respect to access to materials and labor and the fluctuating costs of the same. In addition, these loans are often \u201cinterest-only loans,\u201d which normally require only the payment of interest accrued prior to maturity. Interest-only loans carry greater risk than principal and interest loans because no principal is paid prior to maturity. This risk is particularly apparent during periods of rising interest rates and declining real estate values. If there is a significant decline in the real estate market due to a material increase in interest rates or for other reasons, many of these loans could default and result in foreclosure. Moreover, most of these loans are for projects located in our primary market area. If we are forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion, we may not be able to recover the entire unpaid portion of the loan or we may be required to fund additional money to complete the project or hold the property for an indeterminate period. In addition, real estate exposes us to incurring costs and liabilities for environmental contamination and remediation. Any of these outcomes may result in losses and reduce our earnings.\nThe FDIC has given guidance recommending that if the sum of (i) certain categories of CRE loans and (ii) ADC loans exceeds 300% of total risk-based capital, or if ADC loans exceed 100% of total risk- based capital, heightened risk management practices should be employed to mitigate risk. As of December 31, 2020, our ratio for the sum of CRE and ADC loans was 192% and our ratio for ADC loans was 64%. Our concentration in ADC loans is cyclical and tends to increase in the second and third\nquarters of each year as demand for ADC loans increases. An increase in ADC loan concentration could cause our ratio for ADC loans to increase and even exceed the FDIC\u2019s guideline. We have exceeded these guidance ratios at times in the past and may do so in the future. We actively monitor and believe that we effectively manage our CRE and ADC loan concentrations. If we exceed the FDIC\u2019s guidelines and do not effectively manage the risk of our CRE and ADC loans, we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny, including a requirement to raise additional capital, reduce our loan concentrations, or undertake other remedial actions.\nWe could suffer material credit losses if we do not appropriately manage our credit risk.\nThere are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks in dealing with individual clients, risks of non-payment, risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral and risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions. Changes in the economy may cause the assumptions that we made at origination to change and may cause clients to be unable to make payments on their loans. Significant changes in collateral values may cause us to be unable to collect the full value of loans we make. There is no assurance that our credit risk monitoring and loan approval procedures are or will be adequate or will reduce the inherent risks associated with lending. Our credit personnel, and policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting clients and the quality of our loan portfolio. Any failure to manage such credit risks may materially adversely affect our financial condition and operations.\nThe small- to medium-sized businesses that we lend to may have fewer resources to weather adverse business developments, which may impair their ability to repay a loan, and such impairment could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nWe focus our business development and marketing strategy primarily on small- to medium-sized businesses, which frequently have smaller market shares than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete, and may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which may impair a client\u2019s ability to repay a loan. Small- to medium-sized businesses have been, and likely will continue to be, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which may, in turn, affect the risk rating and collectability of our loans with them. Due to \u201cstay at home\u201d orders and other pandemic management measures, many small- to medium-sized businesses were shut down for portions of 2020. While many received SBA PPP loans or deferrals from the Bank to weather the short-term, the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on such businesses is not yet known. In addition, the success of a small- to medium-sized business often depends on the management skills, talents and efforts of one or two people or a small group of people, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay its loan. If general economic conditions negatively affect Utah and small- to medium-sized businesses are adversely affected or our clients are otherwise affected by adverse business conditions or developments, our business, financial condition and operations could be adversely affected.\nOur profitability depends on interest rates generally, and we may be adversely affected by changes in market interest rates.\nOur profitability depends in substantial part on our net interest income. Our net interest income depends on many factors that are partly or completely outside of our control, including competition, federal economic, monetary and fiscal policies, and economic conditions generally. Our net interest income will be adversely affected if market interest rates change so that the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest we earn on loans and investments. In addition, an increase in interest rates could adversely affect clients\u2019 ability to pay the principal or interest on existing loans or reduce their desire to borrow more money. This may lead to an increase in our non-performing assets, a decrease in loan originations, or a reduction in the value of and income from our loans, any of which could have a material and negative effect on our operations. Fluctuations in market rates and other market disruptions are neither predictable nor controllable and may adversely affect our financial condition and earnings. In response to market concerns arising from the spread of COVID-19, among other domestic and global events, interest rates in the U.S. have recently declined. Interest rates may remain at such rates or decrease further, which could adversely affect our financial condition and earnings.\nWe face strong competition from banks, credit unions and other financial services providers that offer banking services, which may limit our ability to attract and retain banking clients.\nCompetition in the banking industry generally, and in our geographic market specifically, is strong. Competitors include banks, as well as other financial services providers, such as savings and loan institutions, consumer finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries. In particular, our competitors include several larger national and regional financial institutions whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage inasmuch as they may offer a wider array of banking services at better rates and be able to target a broader client base through more extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Moreover, larger competitors may not be as vulnerable as we are to downturns in the local economy and real estate market since they have a broader geographic area and their loan portfolio is more diversified. While our deposit base has increased, several banks have grown their deposit market share in our markets faster than we have resulting in a declining relative deposit market share for us in our existing markets. We believe our declining relative market share in deposits has resulted primarily from aggressive marketing and advertising, in-migration of more competitors, expanded delivery channels and more attractive rates offered by larger bank competitors. We also compete against community banks, credit unions and non-bank financial services companies that have strong local ties. These smaller institutions are likely to cater to the same small to medium-sized businesses that we target. Additionally, financial technology companies (\u201cFintech\u201d) have developed technology that allows clients to obtain loans via the Internet in an expeditious manner and have become competitors to us. If we are unable to attract and retain banking clients, we may be unable to continue to grow our loan and deposit portfolios and our operations and financial condition may otherwise be adversely affected. Ultimately, we may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nRisks Related to Our Growth\nIf we are not able to maintain our past levels of growth, our future prospects and competitive position could be diminished and our profitability could be reduced.\nWe may not be able to sustain our deposit, loan, and asset growth at the rate we have enjoyed during the past several years, including the significant deposit growth experienced since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our growth over the past several years has been driven primarily by residential housing and commercial real estate growth in our market areas, as well as a strong and stable economy in the State of Utah. Although the local economic market conditions do not presently exhibit signs of slowing, a downturn in local economic market conditions, particularly in the real estate market, a failure to attract and retain high performing employees, heightened competition from other financial services providers, and an inability to attract additional core deposits and lending clients, among other factors, could limit our ability to grow as rapidly as we have in the past and as such could have a negative effect on our financial condition and operations.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may incur higher than anticipated costs, and our ability to execute our growth strategy could be impaired.\nWe expect to continue to grow our assets and deposits by increasing our product and service offerings and expanding our operations organically and possibly through acquisitions. Our ability to manage growth successfully will depend on our ability to (i) identify suitable markets for expansion; (ii) attract and retain qualified management; (iii) attract funding to support additional growth; (iv) maintain asset quality and cost controls; (v) maintain adequate regulatory capital and profitability to support our lending activities; and (vi) find attractive acquisition targets and successfully acquire and integrate the acquisitions in an efficient manner. If we do not manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to realize the benefit from the investments in technology, infrastructure, and personnel that we have made to support our expansion. In addition, we may incur higher costs and realize less revenue growth than we expect, which would reduce our earnings and diminish our future prospects, and we may not be able to continue to implement our business strategy and successfully conduct our operations. Failing to maintain effective financial and operational controls as we grow, such as appropriate loan underwriting procedures, adequate allowances for credit losses and compliance with regulatory accounting requirements, could have a negative effect on our financial condition and operations, such as increased credit losses, reduced earnings and potential regulatory penalties and restrictions on growth.\nWe may grow through mergers or acquisitions, which strategy may not be successful or, if successful, may produce risks in successfully integrating and managing the merged companies or acquisition and may dilute our shareholders.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may pursue mergers and acquisitions of banks and nonbank financial services companies within and outside of our principal market area. Although we regularly identify and explore specific acquisition opportunities as part of our ongoing business practices, we may not find a suitable merger or acquisition opportunity. Mergers and acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, existing contracts, accounting processes and personnel of the target and realizing the anticipated synergies of the combined businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in supporting and transitioning clients of the target company;\n\u2022\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;\n\u2022\nthe price we pay or other resources that we devote may exceed the value we realize, or the value we could have realized, if we had allocated the purchase price or other resources to another opportunity;\n\u2022\nentering new markets or areas in which we have limited or no experience;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees and clients from either our business or the target\u2019s business;\n\u2022\nassumption of unanticipated problems or latent liabilities of the target; and\n\u2022\ninability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs.\nMergers and acquisitions frequently result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, which are subject to potential impairments in the future and could harm our financial results. In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities, our existing shareholders may be diluted, which could affect the market price of our common shares. As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate mergers, acquisitions or investments, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such merger or acquisition, and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate. The failure to successfully evaluate and execute mergers, acquisitions or investments or otherwise adequately address these risks could materially harm our financial condition and operations.\nRisks Related to Our Personnel\nWe may have difficulty attracting additional necessary personnel, which may divert resources and limit our ability to successfully expand our operations.\nOur business plan includes, and is dependent upon, our hiring and retaining highly qualified and motivated associates at every level. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, substantial competition in identifying, hiring and retaining top-quality associates due to Utah\u2019s low unemployment rate and new financial institutions entering our markets. If we are unable to hire and retain qualified associates, we may be unable to successfully execute our business strategy and manage our growth.\nThe unexpected loss of key officers would materially and adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategy, and diminish our future prospects.\nOur success to date and our prospects for success in the future depend substantially on our senior management team. The loss of key members of our senior management team could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business plan and, as a result, our future prospects. The loss of senior management without qualified successors who can execute our strategy would also have an adverse impact on us.\nAs a community bank, our ability to maintain our positive reputation is critical to the success of our business. The failure to maintain that reputation may materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our clients and caring about our clients and employees. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Practices\nOur allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nA significant source of risk arises from the possibility that we could sustain losses due to loan defaults and non-performance on loans. We maintain an allowance for credit losses in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States to provide for such defaults and other non-performance. As of December 31, 2020, our allowance for credit losses (\u201cACL\u201d) as a percentage of loans held for investment was 2.43%. The determination of the appropriate level of credit loss allowance is an inherently difficult process and is based on numerous assumptions. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, which may be beyond our control. In addition, our underwriting policies, adherence to credit monitoring processes, and risk management systems and controls may not prevent unexpected losses. Our allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover actual credit losses. Moreover, any increase in our allowance for credit losses will adversely affect our earnings.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\u201cASU 2016-13\u201d). ASU 2016-13 became effective January 1, 2020, and substantially changed the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets held by banks, financial institutions and other organizations. The standard replaced existing incurred loss impairment guidance and established a single allowance framework for financial assets carried at amortized cost. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13, companies must recognize credit losses on these assets equal to management\u2019s estimate of credit losses over the full remaining expected life. Companies must consider all relevant information when estimating expected credit losses, including details about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. In December 2018, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC released a final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to address this accounting change to the treatment of credit expense and allowances. The final rule provided an optional three-year phase-in period for the day-one adverse regulatory capital effects upon adopting the standard. We adopted and implemented the accounting standard fully effective January 1, 2020, the immediate effect of which was an increase to the level of our allowance for credit loss (ACL) and the accompanying result of which was a negative impact on reported earnings and lending activities in periods following adoption. We believe that the levels of ACL as of December 31, 2020 were adequate to absorb current expect credit levels, and we will continue to evaluate and actively manage our ACL; however, we cannot guarantee that such levels will be sufficient to cover actual or future losses.\nOur financial and accounting estimates and risk management framework rely on analytical forecasting and models.\nThe processes we use to estimate our inherent credit losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and operations, depend upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. Some of our tools and metrics for managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior. We rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values. Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting losses, assessing capital adequacy and calculating regulatory capital levels, as well as estimating the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. Poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating such models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information. Moreover, our models may fail to predict future risk exposures if the information used in the model is incorrect, obsolete or not sufficiently comparable to actual events as they occur. We seek to incorporate appropriate historical data in our models, but the range of market values and\nbehaviors reflected in any period of historical data is not at all times predictive of future developments in any particular period and the period of data we incorporate into our models may turn out to be inappropriate for the future period being modeled. In such case, our ability to manage risk would be limited and our risk exposure and losses could be significantly greater than our models indicated. In addition, if existing or potential clients believe our risk management is inadequate, they could take their business elsewhere. This could harm our reputation as well as our revenues and profits. Finally, information we provide to our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could also be inaccurate or misleading. Some of the decisions that our regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to our stockholders, could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.\nImpairment of investment securities could require charges to earnings, which would negatively impact our operations.\nWe maintain a significant amount of our assets in investment securities, and must periodically evaluate investment securities for current expected credit losses. Credit losses for available for sale debt securities are evaluated as of each reporting date when the fair value is less than amortized cost. FASB ASC Subtopic 326-30 requires credit losses to be calculated individually, rather than collectively, using a discounted cash flow method, through which our management compares the present value of expected cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the security. An ACL is established, with a charge to the provision for credit losses (\u201cPCL\u201d), to reflect the credit loss component of the decline in fair value below amortized cost. If the fair value of the security increases over time, any ACL that has not been written off may be reversed through a credit to the PCL. The ACL for an available for sale debt security is limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost, which is referred to as the fair value. The impact of these impairment matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations. At December 31, 2020, we had no allowance for credit losses related to investment securities available for sale.\nRisks Related to Our Access to Capital\nIf we need additional capital in the future to continue our growth, we may not be able to obtain it on terms that are favorable.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future to support our continued growth and to maintain our capital levels. Our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional securities will depend primarily upon our financial condition and the condition of financial markets at that time. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain additional capital in the amounts or on terms satisfactory to us. Our growth may be constrained if we are unable to raise additional capital as needed.\nOur funding sources may prove insufficient to provide liquidity, replace deposits and support our future growth.\nWe rely on client deposits, advances from the FHLB, lines of credit at other financial institutions and the Federal Reserve System to fund our operations. Although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances if desired, we may not be able to replace such funds in the future if our financial condition, the financial condition of the FHLB or market conditions were to change. Our financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates. Finally, if we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In this case, our profitability would be adversely affected.\nFHLB borrowings and other current sources of liquidity may not be available or, if available, not sufficient to provide adequate funding for operations. Furthermore, our own actions could result in a loss of adequate funding. For example, our availability at the FHLB could be reduced if we are deemed to have poor documentation or processes. Accordingly, we may be required to seek additional higher-cost debt in the future to achieve our long-term business objectives. Additional borrowings, if sought, may not be available to us or, if available, may not be available on favorable terms. If additional financing sources are unavailable or are not available on reasonable terms, our growth and future prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe may be adversely affected by the lack of soundness of other financial institutions or financial market utilities.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial institutions are interrelated because of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial institutions or financial market utilities, or the financial services industry generally, may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses of client, creditor and counterparty confidence and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other financial institutions.\nRisks Related to Cyber-security and Information Technology\nCyber-attacks or other security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn the normal course of business, we collect, process, and retain sensitive and confidential information regarding our clients. We also have arrangements in place with other third parties through which we share and receive information about their clients who are or may become our clients. Although we devote significant resources and management focus to ensuring the integrity of our systems through information security and business continuity programs, our facilities and systems, and those of third party service providers, are vulnerable to external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors or other similar events.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions like us have increased recently in part because of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions, particularly during the pendency of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others. In addition to cyber-attacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers recently have engaged in attacks against large financial institutions, particularly denial of service attacks that are designed to disrupt key business services, such as client-facing websites. We are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all potential security breaches, because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. We employ detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents, but early detection may be thwarted by sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection.\nWe also face risks related to cyber-attacks and other security breaches in connection with credit and debit card transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding our clients through various third parties, including merchant acquiring banks, payment processors, payment card networks and our core processors. Some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyber-attacks, and because the transactions involve third parties and environments such as the point of sale that we do not control or secure, future security breaches or cyber-attacks affecting any of these third parties could impact us through no fault of our own, and in some cases we may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks relating to them. We also rely on numerous other third party service providers to conduct other aspects of our business operations and face similar risks relating to them. While we regularly conduct security assessments on these third parties, we cannot be sure that their information security protocols are sufficient at all times to withstand a cyber-attack or other security breach.\nThe access by unauthorized persons to, or the improper disclosure by us of, confidential information regarding our clients or our own proprietary information, software, methodologies, and business secrets could result in significant legal and financial exposure, supervisory liability, damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems, products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations. Recently, there have been a number of well-publicized attacks or breaches affecting others in our industry that have heightened concern by consumers and have resulted in increased regulatory focus. Furthermore, cyber-attacks or other breaches in the future, whether affecting others or us, could intensify consumer concern and regulatory focus and result in reduced use of our cards and increased costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent we are involved in any future cyber-attacks or other breaches, our brand and reputation could be affected, and this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations. If we experience a cyber-attack, our insurance coverage may not cover all losses, and furthermore, we may experience a loss of reputation.\nWe rely on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third party servicers, and the failure of these systems could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third party servicers. In October 2020, we shifted operation of our primary banking and accounting third party software systems from in-house to managed services. We also outsource certain of our information technology systems including our electronic funds transfer, or EFT, ATM and debit card processing, credit and debit card and transaction processing, and our online Internet bill payment and banking services. We rely on these systems to process new and renewal loans, provide client service, facilitate collections and share data across our organization. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to process new and renewal loans and provide client service or compromise our ability to collect loan payments in a timely manner. Our ability to adopt new information technology and technological products needed to meet our clients\u2019 banking needs may be limited if our third party servicers are slow to adopt or choose not to adopt such new technology and products. Such a failure to provide this technology and products to our clients could result in a loss of clients, which would negatively affect our financial condition and operations.\nOther Operational Risks\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks and losses to us.\nOur risk management framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, interest rate and compliance. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. Our risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances and may not adequately mitigate any risk of loss to us. If our framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our financial condition, operations or business prospects could be materially and adversely affected. We may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences.\nWe are subject to certain operating risks, related to client or employee fraud, which could harm our reputation and business.\nEmployee error, or employee or client misconduct, could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our clients or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee error and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee error could also subject us to financial claims for negligence. If our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured, excess insurance coverage is denied or not available, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. In deciding whether to extend credit, we may rely upon our clients\u2019 representations that their financial statements conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, operations and cash flows of the client. We also may rely on client representations and certifications, or other auditors\u2019 reports, with respect to the business and financial condition of our clients. Our financial condition, operations, financial reporting and reputation could be negatively affected if we rely on materially misleading, false, inaccurate or fraudulent information provided by or about clients and counterparties.\nCatastrophic events including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, floods, prolonged drought, and pandemics may adversely affect the general economy, financial and capital markets, specific industries, and the Bank.\nThe Bank has significant operations and a significant customer base in regions where natural and other disasters may occur. These regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, fires, floods, and prolonged drought. These types of natural catastrophic events at times have disrupted the local economy, the Bank\u2019s business and clients, and could pose physical risks to the Bank\u2019s property. In addition, catastrophic events, such as natural disasters or global pandemics, occurring in other regions of the world may have an impact on the Bank\u2019s clients and in turn on the Bank. Although we have business continuity and disaster recovery programs in place, a significant catastrophic event could materially adversely affect the Bank\u2019s operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Regulatory Environment\nWe are subject to regulation, which increases the cost and expense of regulatory compliance, and may restrict our growth and our ability to acquire other financial institutions.\nSupervision, regulation, and examination of the Company and the Bank by the bank regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of consumers, bank clients and the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC, rather than holders of our common shares.\nAs a bank holding company under federal law, we are subject to regulation under the BHCA, and the examination and reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve. In addition to supervising and examining us, the Federal Reserve, through its adoption of regulations implementing the BHCA, places certain restrictions on the permissible activities for bank holding companies. Changes in the number or scope of permissible activities could have an adverse effect on our ability to realize our strategic goals.\nAs a Utah state-chartered bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank is separately subject to regulation by both the FDIC and the UDFI. The FDIC and UDFI regulate numerous aspects of the Bank\u2019s operations, including adequate capital and financial condition, permissible types and amounts of extensions of credit and investments, permissible non-banking activities and restrictions on dividend payments. The Bank undergoes periodic examinations by the FDIC and UDFI. Following such examinations, the Bank may be required, among other things, to change its respective asset valuations or the amounts of required credit loss allowances or to restrict its respective operations, as well as increase its respective capital levels, which could adversely affect our operations.\nWe may be required to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with applicable laws and regulations. This allocation of resources, as well as any failure to comply with applicable requirements, may negatively affect our operations and financial condition.\nBanking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any regulatory actions to which we become subject because such examinations could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe UDFI, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations. Accommodating such examinations may require management to reallocate resources that would otherwise be used in the day-to-day operation of other aspects of our business. If, as a result of an examination, the UDFI or a federal banking agency were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we or our management were in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions could include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against us, our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to clients, to terminate our deposit insurance. FDIC deposit insurance is critical to the continued operation of the Bank. If we become subject to such regulatory actions, our business operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges in laws, government regulation and monetary policy may have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nFinancial institutions have been the subject of significant legislative and regulatory changes (including the continuing enactment and potential amendment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010) and may be the subject of further significant legislation or regulation in the future, none of which is within our control. This may result in repeals of or amendments to, existing laws, treaties, regulations, guidance, reporting, recordkeeping requirements, and other government policies. Significant new laws or regulations or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws or regulations, including those with respect to federal and state taxation, may cause our results of operations to differ materially. In addition, the costs and burden of compliance could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. Further, federal monetary policy significantly affects the Bank\u2019s credit conditions, as well as the Bank\u2019s clients, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve, primarily through open market operations in U.S. government securities, the discount rate for bank borrowings and reserve requirements. A material change in any of these conditions could have a material impact on us, the Bank and the Bank\u2019s clients, and therefore on our operations.\nNew and future rulemaking by the CFPB and other regulators, as well as enforcement of existing consumer protection laws, may have a material effect on our operations and operating costs.\nThe CFPB has the authority to implement and enforce a variety of existing federal consumer protection statutes and to issue new regulations. However, with respect to institutions of our size, it does not have primary examination and enforcement authority. The authority to examine depository institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, such as the Bank, for compliance with federal consumer laws remains largely with our primary federal regulator, the FDIC. However, the CFPB may participate in examinations of smaller institutions on a \u201csampling basis\u201d and may refer potential enforcement actions against such institutions to their primary regulators. In some cases, regulators such as the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and the Department of Justice also retain certain rulemaking or enforcement authority, and we remain subject to certain state consumer protection laws. As an independent bureau within the Federal Reserve, the CFPB may impose requirements more severe than the previous bank regulatory agencies. The CFPB has placed significant emphasis on consumer complaint management and has established a public consumer complaint database to encourage consumers to file complaints they may have against financial institutions. We are expected to monitor and respond to these complaints, including those that we deem frivolous, and doing so may require management to reallocate resources away from more profitable endeavors.\nThe CFPB has a number of significant rules that affect nearly every aspect of the lifecycle of a residential mortgage. These rules implement the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. The rules require banks to, among other things: (i) develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with a new \u201creasonable ability to repay\u201d test and identify whether a loan meets a new definition for a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d; (ii) implement new or revised disclosures, policies and procedures for servicing mortgages including, but not limited to, early intervention with delinquent clients and specific loss mitigation procedures for loans secured by a client\u2019s principal residence; (iii) comply with additional restrictions on mortgage loan originator compensation; and (iv) comply with new disclosure requirements and standards for appraisals and escrow accounts maintained for \u201chigher priced mortgage loans.\u201d These rules create operational and strategic challenges for us, as we are both a mortgage originator and a servicer. For example, business models for cost, pricing, delivery, compensation, and risk management will need to be re-evaluated and potentially revised, perhaps substantially.\nWe are subject to stringent capital requirements.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal banking agencies adopted final rules, or the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules, to update their general risk-based capital and leverage capital requirements to incorporate agreements reflected in the Third Basel Accord adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, or Basel III Capital Standards, as well as the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. The U.S. Basel III Capital Rules are described in more detail in \u201cSupervision and Regulation - Basel III.\u201d In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the\nBasel III post-crisis regulatory reforms, which standards are commonly referred to as Basel IV. Among other things, these standards revise the Basel Committee\u2019s standardized approach for credit risk (including the recalibration of the risk weights and the introduction of new capital requirements for certain \u201cunconditionally cancellable commitments,\u201d such as unused credit card lines of credit) and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. Under the Basel framework, and following a one-year deferral due to the pendency of the COVID-19 pandemic, these standards will generally be effective on January 1, 2023, with an aggregate output floor phasing in through January 1, 2028. Under the current U.S. capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches banking organizations, and not to the Bank. The impact of Basel IV on us will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by federal bank regulators.\nThe failure to meet the established capital requirements could result in one or more of our regulators placing limitations or conditions on our activities or restricting the commencement of new activities. Such failure could subject us to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities, including limiting our ability to pay dividends, issuing a directive to increase our capital and terminating our FDIC deposit insurance. FDIC deposit insurance is critical to the continued operation of the Bank.\nOur failure to meet applicable regulatory capital requirements, or to maintain appropriate capital levels in general, could affect client and investor confidence, our ability to grow, our costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, our ability to pay dividends on common shares, our ability to make acquisitions, and our operations and financial condition, generally.\nWe may be required to contribute capital or assets to the Bank that could otherwise be invested or deployed more profitably elsewhere.\nFederal law and regulatory policy impose a number of obligations on bank holding companies designed to reduce potential loss exposure to the clients of insured depository subsidiaries and to the FDIC\u2019s deposit insurance fund. For example, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its FDIC-insured depository subsidiaries and to commit financial resources to support such institutions where it might not do so otherwise. These situations include guaranteeing the compliance of an \u201cundercapitalized\u201d bank with its obligations under a capital restoration plan.\nA capital injection into the Bank may be required at times when we do not have the resources to provide it at the holding company level; therefore, we may be required to issue common shares or debt to obtain the required capital. Issuing additional common shares would dilute our current shareholders\u2019 percentage of ownership and could cause the price of our common shares to decline. Any debt would be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the Company\u2019s general unsecured creditors or equity holdings. Thus, any Company borrowing to make the required capital injection may be expensive and adversely affect our cash flows, financial condition, operations, and business prospects.\nWe face a risk of non-compliance and enforcement actions with respect to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nLike all U.S. financial institutions, we are subject to monitoring requirements under federal law, including anti-money laundering, or AML, and BSA matters. Since September 11, 2001, banking regulators have intensified their focus on AML and BSA compliance requirements, particularly the AML provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s OFAC, which involve sanctions for dealing with certain persons or countries. While the Bank has adopted policies, procedures and controls to comply with the BSA, other AML statutes and regulations and OFAC regulations, this aggressive supervision and examination and increased likelihood of enforcement actions may increase our operating costs, which could negatively affect our operations and reputation.\nWe are subject to federal and state fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nFederal and state fair lending laws and regulations, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, impose non-discriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The FDIC, the Department of Justice, the CFPB and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. A successful challenge to our performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact our rating under the CRA, and result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact our reputation, financial condition and operations.\nRegulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities.\nWe are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, including requirements concerning security breach notification, and these laws could negatively affect us. GLBA imposes requirements for the safeguarding of certain client information. Various state and federal banking regulators and states have also enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Moreover, legislators and regulators in the United States are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer or employee information, and some of our current or planned business activities. This could also increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives. This includes increased privacy-related enforcement activity at the federal level, by the FTC, as well as at the state level, such as with regard to mobile applications.\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws (including those regarding security breach notification) affecting client or employee data to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions or operations. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory or governmental investigations or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations.\nRisks Related to Dividends and Our Common Shares\nWe may be unable to, or choose not to, pay dividends on our common shares.\nWe have consistently declared an annual cash dividend for over 50 years. Our ability to continue to pay dividends depends on various factors. ALTA is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and does not conduct stand-alone operations, which means that the Bank must first pay dividend(s) to the Company. The FDIC, the UDFI and Utah state law may, under certain circumstances, prohibit the Bank\u2019s payment of dividends to ALTA. Federal Reserve policy requires bank holding companies to pay cash dividends on common shares only out of net income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization\u2019s expected future needs and financial condition. ALTA\u2019s Board of Directors may determine that, even though funds are available for dividend payments, retaining the funds for other internal uses, such as expansion of our operations, is necessary or appropriate in light of our business plan and objectives. A failure to pay dividends may negatively affect your investment.\nThe Company\u2019s business or the value of its common shares could be negatively affected as a result of actions by activist shareholders.\nThe Company values constructive input from shareholders. ALTA\u2019s Board of Directors and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all of the Company\u2019s shareholders. Activist shareholders who disagree with the composition of the Board of Directors, ALTA\u2019s strategic direction, or the way the Company is managed may seek to effect change through various strategies that range from private engagement to public filings, proxy contests, efforts to force transactions not supported by the Board of Directors, and litigation. Responding to some of these actions can be costly and time-consuming, may disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and divert the attention of the Board of Directors and management. Such activities could interfere with the Company\u2019s ability to execute its strategic plan and to attract and retain qualified executive leadership. The perceived uncertainty as to the Company\u2019s future direction resulting from activist strategies could also affect the market price and volatility of ALTA\u2019s common shares.\nThe price of our common shares may fluctuate significantly and our stock may have low trading volumes, which may make it difficult for you to resell common shares owned by you at times or prices you find attractive.\nThe stock market and, in particular, the market for financial institution stocks, has experienced significant volatility. The markets may produce downward pressure on stock prices for certain issuers without regard to those issuers\u2019 underlying financial strength. As a result, the trading volume in our common shares may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. This may make it difficult for you to resell common shares owned by you at times or at prices you find attractive. The low trading volume in our common shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market means that our shares may have less liquidity than other publicly traded companies. We cannot ensure that the volume of trading in our common shares or the price of our common shares will be maintained or will increase in the future.", "PERMNO": 15435, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "ALTA"}
