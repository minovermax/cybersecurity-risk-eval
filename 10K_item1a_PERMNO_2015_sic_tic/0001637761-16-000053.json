RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Form 10-K, in evaluating the Company and our common stock. If any of the risks described below actually occurs, our business, financial results, financial condition and stock price could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nWe expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient sales to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we dedicate significant resources to our marketing and product development strategy, as well as incur increased general and administrative expenses due to operating as an independent public company following the spin-off. We intend to increase our operating expenses substantially relative to prior periods as we: (i) develop new and next generation products and product line extensions (all of which we refer to as \u201cnew products\u201d); (ii) develop new medical techniques designed to enhance the utility of our products; (iii) collect clinical data and conduct clinical studies to differentiate our products from those of our competitors and to demonstrate the value of our products to current and prospective customers and payors; (iv) add independent sales agents and stocking distributors to increase our geographic sales coverage and penetration; (v) increase product inventory to raise the likelihood of success of new product launches; and (vi) expand our marketing campaigns and surgeon education and training programs. We cannot assure you that we will ever generate sufficient revenues from our operations to achieve profitability and, even if we achieve profitability, we cannot assure you that we will remain profitable over time. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively affect the value of our securities and our ability to attract and retain personnel, raise capital, execute our business strategy or continue operations.\nThe industry and market segments in which we operate are highly competitive and, unless we successfully demonstrate to our neurosurgeon and orthopedic spine surgeon customers the merits of our products compared to those of our competitors, we may be unable to compete successfully.\nThere is intense competition among medical device companies that serve the spinal surgery market. We compete with established medical technology companies, as well as earlier-stage companies that often have differentiated technology and potentially superior solutions for the challenges facing our neurosurgeon and orthopedic spine surgeon customers and their patients. Many of our competitors may have access to greater financial, technical, research and development, marketing, manufacturing, sales, distribution, administrative, consulting and other resources than we do. Our competitors may be more effective at developing products, at differentiating their products from our and other competitor products and at designing, executing, analyzing the results of and publishing data from clinical studies, and they may have more established distribution networks, entrenched relationships with surgeons or greater experience in launching, marketing and selling products than we do. Our primary competitors include Alphatec, Bacterin, Baxter, Biomet, DePuy Synthes Spine (a Johnson & Johnson company), Globus Medical, Medtronic, NuVasive, K2M, LDR, Orthofix, RTI Surgical, Stryker and Zimmer, as well as several smaller, biologically-focused companies.\nOur competitive position depends on our ability to achieve market acceptance for our current and future products. Market acceptance for any of our products requires, among other things, that we timely secure regulatory approval; demonstrate the value of our products, both to our surgeon customers and payors, which may require that we collect clinical data and/or conduct clinical studies; effectively educate and train surgeons and their staff on the proper use of our products; obtain and maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement for our products, both within and outside the U.S., including under Medicare and Medicaid and from private payors; attract and retain a network of independent sales agents and stocking distributors focused on neurosurgeons and orthopedic spine surgeons; develop and execute an effective marketing strategy; protect the proprietary positions of our products, including through patent protection; and consistently produce quality products in sufficient quantities to meet demand. There are significant risks associated with each of these activities and other activities required to achieve market acceptance of both our current and future products, some of which are more fully described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nNeurosurgeons and orthopedic spine surgeons play a significant role in determining the course of treatment and, ultimately, the product used to treat a patient. As a result, our success depends, in large part, on demonstrating to these surgeons the value of our products in the treatment of their patients. To do so requires that we, along with our independent sales agents and stocking distributors, demonstrate the merits of our products and underlying technology compared to those of our competitors. Surgeons who do not use our products may be hesitant to do so for the following or other reasons:\n\u2022\nlack of experience with our products, techniques or technologies;\n\u2022\nexisting relationships with those who sell competitive products;\n\u2022\nthe time required for surgeon and medical staff education and training on new products, techniques and equipment;\n\u2022\nlack or perceived lack of clinical evidence supporting patient benefit relative to competing products;\n\u2022\nour products not being included on hospital formularies or integrated delivery network or group purchasing organization preferred vendor lists;\n\u2022\nless attractive coverage and/or reimbursement within healthcare payment systems for our products and procedures compared to other products and procedures;\n\u2022\nother costs associated with the introduction of new products and the equipment necessary to use new products; and\n\u2022\nperceived risk of liability that could be associated with the use of new products and techniques.\nIf we are not successful in convincing surgeons of the merits of our products, or educating and training them and their staff on the proper use of our products, they may not use our products and, as a result, we may be unable to maintain or grow our sales or achieve or sustain profitability.\nChanges in third-party payment systems and in the healthcare industry may require us to decrease the selling price for our products, may reduce the size of the market for our products, or may eliminate a market, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial performance.\nOur operations may be substantially affected by fundamental changes in the political, economic and regulatory landscape of the healthcare industry. Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs are continuing in the U.S., and in many other countries where we do business, causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective treatments. These initiatives include price regulation, competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements.\nMaintaining and growing sales of our products depends on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, both within and outside the U.S., including government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care organizations. Hospitals and other healthcare providers that purchase our products generally rely on third-party payors to cover all or part of the costs associated with the procedures performed with our products, including the cost to purchase our product. Both the patients\u2019 and our customers\u2019 access to adequate coverage and reimbursement for the procedures performed with our products by government and private insurance plans is central to the acceptance of our current and future products. We may be unable to sell our products on a profitable basis, or at all, if third-party payors deny coverage or reduce their levels of payment. In addition, if our cost of production increases at a greater rate than increases in reimbursement levels for our products, our profitability may be adversely affected.\nThe healthcare industry, both within and outside the U.S., has experienced a trend toward cost containment as government and private insurers seek to control rising healthcare costs by imposing lower payment and negotiating reduced contract rates with service providers. Third-party payors continually review their coverage and reimbursement policies for procedures involving the use of our products and can, without notice, eliminate or reduce coverage or reimbursement for our products. For example, a major national third-party insurer in the U.S. recently reduced coverage (from all or most cases to limited indications) for biomechanical devices (e.g., spine cages) used in cervical fusion procedures, stating that the devices had not been shown to be more effective than bone graft. In addition, certain insurers have limited coverage for vertebral fusions in the lumbar spine and other insurers may adopt similar coverage decisions in the future. Patients covered by these insurers may be unwilling or unable to afford lumbar fusion surgeries to treat their conditions, which could materially harm or limit our ability to sell our products designed for such surgeries. Further, third-party payors of hospital services and hospital outpatient services annually revise their payment methodologies, which could result in stricter standards for or the elimination of reimbursement of hospital charges for certain medical procedures.\nTo the extent we sell our products internationally, market acceptance may depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement within prevailing healthcare payment systems. Reimbursement and healthcare payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country. As in the U.S., our products may not obtain coverage and reimbursement approvals in a timely manner, if at all, in a particular foreign market. In addition, even if we are able to obtain country-specific coverage and reimbursement approvals, we could incur considerable expense to do so. Our failure to obtain such coverage and approvals would negatively affect market acceptance of our products in the international markets in which such failure occurs and the expenses incurred in connection with obtaining such coverage and approvals could outweigh the benefits of obtaining them.\nIf the trend by governmental agencies and other third-party payors to reduce coverage of and/or reimbursement for procedures using our products continues, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Further, we cannot be certain that, under current and future payment systems, the cost of our products will be adequately incorporated into the overall cost of the procedure and, accordingly, we cannot be certain that the procedures performed with our products will be reimbursed at a cost-effective level, or at all.\nIndustry trends have resulted in increased downward pricing pressure on medical services and products, which may affect our ability to sell our products at prices necessary to support our current business strategy.\nThe trend toward healthcare cost containment and the growth of managed care organizations is placing increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical therapies. For example:\n\u2022\nThere has been consolidation among healthcare facilities and purchasers of medical devices, particularly in the U.S. One of the results of such consolidation is that group purchasing organizations, integrated delivery networks and large single accounts use their market power to consolidate purchasing decisions, which in turn intensifies competition to provide products and services to healthcare providers and other industry participants, resulting in greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments. For example, some group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing for its member hospitals and require us to discount, or limit our ability to raise, prices for certain of our products.\n\u2022\nSurgeons increasingly have moved from independent, out-patient practice settings toward employment by hospitals and other healthcare entities, which align surgeons\u2019 product choices with their employers\u2019 price sensitivities and adds to pricing pressures. Hospitals have introduced and may continue to introduce new pricing structures into their contracts to contain healthcare costs, including fixed price formulas and capitated and construct pricing.\n\u2022\nCertain hospitals provide financial incentives to doctors for reducing hospital costs (known as gainsharing), rewarding physician efficiency (known as physician profiling) and encouraging partnerships with healthcare service and goods providers to reduce prices.\n\u2022\nExisting and proposed laws, regulations and industry policies, in both domestic and international markets, regulate or seek to increase regulation of sales and marketing practices and the pricing and profitability of companies in the healthcare industry.\nMore broadly, other provisions of the Affordable Care Act could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered in the U.S., and may adversely affect our business and results of operations. For example, the Affordable Care Act encourages hospitals and physicians to work collaboratively through shared savings programs, such as accountable care organizations, as well as other bundled payment initiatives, which may ultimately result in the reduction of medical device purchases and the consolidation of medical device suppliers used by hospitals. There are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not fully understood, and it is unclear what the full impact of the legislation will be. We cannot predict accurately what healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the U.S. federal or state level, or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the U.S. or elsewhere. However, any changes that lower reimbursements for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, the proliferation of medical device distributors that are owned, directly or indirectly, by physicians (commonly referred to as physician-owned distributorships, or PODs) could result in increased pricing pressure on our products or harm our ability to sell our products to physicians who own or are affiliated with these distributors. These physicians derive a proportion of their revenue from selling or arranging for the sale of medical devices for use in procedures they perform on their own patients at hospitals that agree to purchase from or through the POD, or that otherwise furnish ordering physicians with income that is based, directly or indirectly, on those orders of medical devices. The number of PODs in the spine industry may continue to grow as economic pressures increase throughout the industry and as hospitals, insurers and physicians search for ways to reduce costs and, in the case of the physicians, search for ways to increase their incomes. PODs and the physicians who own, or partially own, them have significant market knowledge and access to the surgeons who use our products and the hospitals that purchase our products. Growth in the number of PODs may reduce our ability to compete effectively for business from surgeons who own them, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the largest device companies with multiple product franchises have increased their effort to leverage and contract broadly with customers across franchises by providing volume discounts and multi-year arrangements that could prevent our access to these customers or make it difficult (or impossible) to compete on price.\nWe may be unable to develop new products in a timely and consistent manner, and failure to do so may adversely affect the attractiveness of our overall product portfolio to our surgeon customers and negatively impact our sales and market share.\nTo be and remain competitive, we need to develop new products on a regular basis and respond to technological advances. Doing so is technologically challenging and involves significant risks and uncertainty. Despite substantial investments of time and resources, our research and development efforts may not result in technically feasible new products. Even if technically feasible, the anticipated time and cost of obtaining regulatory approval and/or commercializing a new product may be too great to justify continued development. Even if we determine to continue development, competitors could develop similar products that are more effective, are less expensive to manufacture, are priced more competitively or are ready for commercial introduction before our products. If we are unable to develop technically and commercially viable products on a consistent basis and before our competitors, our future prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to maintain and expand our network of independent sales agents and stocking distributors, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue.\nOur ability to generate revenue depends on the sales and marketing efforts of independent sales agents and stocking distributors. Some of our independent sales agents account for a significant portion of our sales volume. If our independent sales agents and stocking distributors fail to adequately promote, market and sell our products, our sales could significantly decrease.\nFurther, we face significant challenges and risks in managing our geographically dispersed distribution network and retaining the independent sales agents and stocking distributors who make up that network, and as we launch new products and increase our marketing efforts with respect to existing products, we plan to expand the reach of our marketing and sales networks and may need to hire new independent sales agents and stocking distributors. Independent sales agents and stocking distributors require significant technical expertise in various areas-such as spinal care practices, spine injuries and disease and spinal health-and they require training and time to achieve full productivity. Because of the intense competition for their services, we may be unable to attract or retain additional qualified independent sales agents or stocking distributors or be able to enter into agreements with them on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our success will depend largely on our ability to continue to hire, train, retain and motivate qualified independent sales agents and stocking distributors. If we are unable to expand our sales and marketing capabilities domestically and internationally, if we fail to train new independent sales agents and stocking distributors adequately, or if we experience high turnover in our sales network, we may not be able to commercialize our products adequately, or at all, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMoreover, our independent sales agents and stocking distributors are not our employees, we have limited control over their activities and, generally, we do not enter into exclusive relationships with them. If one or more of them were to be retained by a competitor, whether or an exclusive or non-exclusive basis, they may divert business from us to our competitor, which could materially and adversely affect our sales.\nSales of, or the price at which we sell, our products may be adversely affected unless the safety and efficacy of our products, alone and relative to competitive products, is demonstrated in clinical studies.\nGenerally, we have obtained 510(k) clearance to manufacture, market and sell the products we market in the U.S. and the right to affix the CE mark to the products we market in the European Economic Area, or EEA. However, to date, we have not been required to generate new clinical data to support our current 510(k) clearances, CE marks, or product registrations in other countries and, accordingly, we do not have our own clinical data regarding our currently marketed products. Certain of our competitors have clinical data supporting the safety and efficacy of their products, which may place our products at a competitive disadvantage and materially and adversely impact our revenues.\nIn part due to the increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective treatments, purchasing decisions of our customers increasingly will be based on clinical data that demonstrates the value of our products or the effectiveness of our products relative to others. Conducting clinical studies is expensive and time-consuming and outcomes are uncertain. See \u201cRisks Relating to Our Regulatory Environment-Clinical studies are expensive and subject to extensive regulation and their results may not support our product candidate claims or may result in the discovery of adverse effects,\u201d below. We may elect not to, or may be unable to, fund the clinical studies necessary to generate the data required for all of our products to compete effectively, in part due to the breadth our product portfolio. Currently, we do not expect to undertake such clinical studies for all of our products and will only do so where we anticipate the benefits will outweigh the costs on a risk-adjusted basis. However, even when we elect and are able to fund such clinical studies on one or more of our products, they may not be successful. Data we generate may not be consistent with our existing data and may demonstrate less favorable safety or efficacy, which could reduce demand for our products and negatively impact future sales. Neurosurgeons and orthopedic spine surgeons may be less likely to use our products if more robust, or any, clinical data supporting the safety and efficacy of competing products is available. If we are unable to or unwilling to generate clinical data supporting the safety and efficacy of our products, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf any of our manufacturing, development or research facilities are damaged and/or our manufacturing processes are interrupted, we could experience supply disruptions, lost revenues and our business could be seriously harmed.\nDamage to our manufacturing, development or research facilities or disruption to our business operations for any reason, including natural disaster (such as earthquake, wildfires and other fires or extreme weather), power loss, communications failure, unauthorized entry or other events, such as a flu or other health epidemic, could cause us to discontinue development and/or manufacturing of some or all of our products for an undetermined period of time. In addition, our facilities would be difficult to replace and would require substantial lead time to repair or replace. The property damage and business interruption insurance coverage on these facilities that we maintain might not cover all losses under such circumstances, and we may not be able to renew\nor obtain such insurance in the future on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or at reasonable costs. In particular, we manufacture our orthobiologics products in one facility located in Irvine, California and any damage to that facility could adversely affect our ability to timely satisfy demand for those products. Any significant disruption to our manufacturing operations and to our ability to meet market demand likely would have an adverse impact on our sales and revenues as key stakeholders, including our independent sales agents and stocking distributors and surgeon customers, transition to what they perceive as more reliable sources of products.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of third-party suppliers for components and raw materials and the loss of any of these suppliers, or their inability to provide us with an adequate supply of materials that meet our quality and other requirements, could harm our business.\nOutside suppliers, some of whom are sole-source suppliers, provide us with spine hardware products and raw materials and components used in the manufacture of our orthobiologics and hardware products. We strive to maintain sufficient inventory of spine hardware products, raw materials and components so that our production will not be significantly disrupted if a particular product, raw material or component is not available to us for a period of time. Although we believe there are alternative supply sources, replacing our current suppliers may be impractical or difficult in many instances. For example, we could have difficulty obtaining similar products from other suppliers that are acceptable to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, or other foreign regulatory authorities. If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of spine hardware products, raw materials or components that meet our quality and other requirements on a timely basis for any reason, we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of our products to meet market demand until a new or alternative supply source is identified and qualified and, as a result, we could lose customers, our reputation could be harmed and our business could suffer. In 2013, we experienced supply shortages in collagen ceramic matrix bone void fillers, which adversely affected sales of our orthobiologics products, even after the supply shortage was resolved.\nFurther, the FDA Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, or the FDASIA, which includes the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2012, as well as other medical device provisions, went into effect October 1, 2012. Under FDASIA, all U.S. and foreign manufacturers must have a FDA Establishment Registration and complete Medical Device listings for sales in the U.S. While our facilities materially comply with these requirements, we also source products from foreign contract manufacturers. It is possible that some of our foreign contract manufacturers will not comply with applicable requirements and choose not to register with the FDA. In such an event, we will need to determine if there are alternative foreign contract manufacturers who comply with the FDA Establishment Registration requirements. If such a foreign contract manufacturer is a sole supplier of one of our products, there is a risk that we may not be able to source another supplier.\nFurthermore, an uncorrected defect or supplier\u2019s variation in a component or raw material that is incompatible with our manufacturing, unknown to us, could harm our ability to manufacture products.\nIn addition, we rely on a small number of tissue banks accredited by the American Association of Tissue Banks for the supply of human tissue, a crucial component of our orthobiologics products that serve as bone graft substitutes. We cannot be certain that these tissue banks will be able to fulfill our requirements or that we will be able to successfully negotiate with other accredited tissue facilities on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe are dependent on information technology and if our information technology fails to operate adequately or fails to properly maintain the integrity of our data, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend significantly on sophisticated information technology, or IT, for our infrastructure and to support business decisions. As a result of technology initiatives and changes in our system platforms due, in part, to our relatively recently becoming an independent public company, we are in the process of consolidating and integrating our systems. Our IT needs require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with new technology, evolving regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information and changing customer patterns. Currently, we do not have an IT disaster recovery plan. Any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption, corruption or destruction of these systems could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, although our computer and information systems are protected through physical and software safeguards, they are still vulnerable to system malfunction, computer viruses, and cyber-attacks. These events could lead to the unauthorized access and result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers. The techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world. As a result, we may not be able to address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures. If our IT systems are compromised, due to a data breach or\notherwise, we could be subject to fines, damages, litigation and enforcement actions and we could lose trade secrets or other confidential information, the occurrence of which could harm our business and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expend substantial resources to comply with laws and regulations relating to public companies, and any failure to maintain compliance could subject us to regulatory scrutiny and cause investors to lose confidence in our company, which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nLaws and regulations affecting public companies, including provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX, and the related rules and regulations adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and by the NASDAQ Global Market have resulted in, and will continue to result in, significant costs to us as we evaluate the implications of these rules and respond to their requirements. For example, compliance with Section 404 of SOX, including performing the system and process documentation and evaluation necessary to issue our annual report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and, if applicable, obtain the required attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm, requires us to incur substantial expense and expend significant management time. Further, we (through our former parent company) have in the past discovered, and in the future may discover, areas of internal controls that need improvement. If we identify deficiencies in our internal controls that are deemed to be material weaknesses, we could become subject to scrutiny by regulatory authorities and lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely basis, or at all. Also, previously effective controls may become inadequate over time as a result of changes in our business or operating structure, and we may fail to take measures to evaluate the adequacy of and update these controls, as necessary, which could lead to a material misstatement.\nIn addition, new laws and regulations could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the coverage that is the same or similar to our current coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or board committees, and as our executive officers. We cannot predict or estimate with any reasonable accuracy the total amount or timing of the costs we may incur to comply with these laws and regulations.\nOur business could suffer if we lose the services of key members of our senior management or fail to hire and retain other personnel on whom our business relies.\nOur ability to execute our business strategy and compete in the highly competitive medical device industry depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Companies in the medical device industry in general have experienced a high rate of personnel turnover. Loss of key employees, including any of our scientific, technical and managerial personnel, could adversely affect our ability to successfully execute our current business strategy, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, replacing key employees may be a difficult, costly and protracted process, and we may not have other personnel with the capacity to assume all of the responsibilities of a departing employee. Competition for qualified personnel, particularly for key positions, is intense among companies in our industry, particularly in the San Diego, California area, and many of the organizations against which we compete for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources and different risk profiles than our company, which may make them more attractive employers. All of our employees, including our management personnel, may terminate their employment with us at any time without notice. If we cannot attract and retain skilled personnel, as needed, we may not achieve our financial and other goals.\nMoreover, future internal growth could impose significant added responsibilities on our management, and we will need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees to manage growth effectively. If we are unable to effectively manage such growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, we may not be able to achieve our goals, and our ability to generate and/or grow revenue could be diminished.\nWe may have significant product liability exposure and our insurance may not cover all potential claims.\nWe are exposed to product liability and other claims if our products are alleged to have caused harm. For example, the development of allograft implants and technologies for human tissue repair and treatment may entail particular risk of transmitting diseases to human recipients, and any such transmission could result in the assertion of product liability claims against us. Further, successful product liability claims made against one or more of our competitors could cause claims to be made against us or expose us to a perception that we are vulnerable to similar claims. Product liability claims are expensive to defend, divert our management\u2019s\nattention and, if we are not successful in defending the claim, can result in substantial damages awarded against us.\nIn addition, we may not be able to obtain or renew insurance on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or at reasonable cost. Even if we obtain insurance, a claim could exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or it may be excluded from coverage under the terms of the policy. If we do not have adequate insurance coverage, products liability claims could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to successfully market our products and on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if a product liability claim is not successful or is not fully pursued, the adverse publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused harm could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation with existing and potential customers and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur strategy could involve growth through acquisitions, which would require us to incur substantial costs and potential liabilities for which we may never realize the anticipated benefits.\nWe may grow our business through acquisitions, a strategy which ultimately could prove unsuccessful. Any new acquisition could result in material transaction expenses, increased interest and amortization expense, increased depreciation expense, increased operating expense and possible in-process research and development charges for acquisitions that do not meet the definition of a \u201cbusiness,\u201d any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results.\nIn addition, businesses that we acquire may not have adequate financial, disclosure, regulatory, quality or other compliance controls in place at the time we acquire them, which may create uncertainty regarding the actual condition and financial results of the acquired business and our assumptions regarding synergies and future results. Following any acquisition, we must integrate the new business, which includes incorporating it into our financial, compliance, regulatory and quality systems. Failure to timely and successfully integrate acquired businesses may result in non-compliance with regulatory or other requirements and may result in unexpected costs, including as a result of inadequate cost containment and unrealized economies of scale. In addition, acquisitions involve other risks, including diversion of management resources, risks associated with entering markets in which our marketing and sales personnel may have limited experience and disruption to existing relationships with employees, suppliers, customers and sales agents, both with respect to us and the acquired company. As a result of any of the foregoing, we may not realize the expected benefit from any acquisition. If we cannot integrate acquired businesses, products or technologies, our business, financial conditions and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nFurthermore, as a result of acquisitions of other healthcare businesses, we may be subject to the risk of unanticipated business uncertainties, regulatory and other compliance matters or legal liabilities relating to those acquired businesses for which the sellers of the acquired businesses may not indemnify us, for which we may not be able to obtain insurance (or adequate insurance) or for which the indemnification may not be sufficient to cover the ultimate liabilities.\nWe are exposed to a variety of risks relating to our international sales and operations, including fluctuations in exchange rates, delays in collection of accounts receivable and local economic conditions.\nAs a result of our international sales and operations, we generate revenues in various foreign currencies including euros, British pounds, Swiss francs and New Zealand dollars, and in U.S. dollar-denominated transactions conducted with customers who generate revenue in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We also incur operating expenses in euros. We cannot predict accurately the consolidated effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the variability of currency exposure in our revenues and operating expenses and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates. Although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities, those actions may not prove to be fully effective.\nIn addition, for those foreign customers who purchase our products in U.S. dollars, currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which those customers do business may have a negative effect on the demand for our products in foreign countries where the U.S. dollar has increased in value compared to the local currency.\nConverting our earnings from international operations to U.S. dollars for use in the U.S. can also raise challenges, including problems moving funds out of the countries in which the funds were earned and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable in foreign countries where the usual accounts receivable payment cycle is longer.\nLocal economic conditions, legal, regulatory or political considerations, disruptions from strikes, the effectiveness of our independent stocking distributors, local competition, in-country reimbursement methodologies and changes in local medical practice could also affect our sales in foreign markets.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we, our employees, or our independent sales agents or stocking distributors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our competitors or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at other medical device companies, including our competitors or potential competitors, in some cases immediately prior to joining us. In addition, many of our independent sales agents and stocking distributors sell, or in the past have sold, products of our competitors. See \u201cIf we are unable to maintain and expand our network of independent sales agents and stocking distributors, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue,\u201d and \u201cOur business could suffer if we lose the services of key members of our senior management or fail to hire and retain other personnel on whom our business relies,\u201d above. We may be subject to claims that we, our employees or our independent sales agents or stocking distributors have intentionally, inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of former employers or competitors. In addition, we have been and may in the future be subject to claims that we caused an employee to breach the terms of his or her non-competition or non-solicitation agreement. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Litigation is expensive, time-consuming and could divert management attention and resources away from our business. Even if we prevail, the cost of litigation could affect our profitability. If we do not prevail, in addition to any damages we might have to pay, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or employees, independent sales agents or stocking distributors. There can be no assurance that this type of litigation or the threat thereof will not adversely affect our ability to engage and retain key employees, sales agents or stocking distributors.\nWe might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances because of certain restrictions relating to requirements for tax-free distributions.\nOur ability to engage in significant equity transactions could be limited or restricted in order to preserve, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax-free nature of the distribution and related activities associated with our separation from Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation, or Integra, our former parent. Even if the distribution and related activities otherwise qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, they may result in corporate-level taxable gain to Integra under Section 355(e) of the Code if there is a 50% or greater change in ownership, by vote or value, of shares of our stock or Integra\u2019s stock occurring as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution. Any acquisitions or issuances of our stock or Integra\u2019s stock within two years after the distribution are generally presumed to be part of such a plan, although we or Integra may be able to rebut that presumption.\nUnder the Tax Matters Agreement we entered into with Integra, we are prohibited from taking or failing to take any action that prevents distribution activities from being tax-free. Further, during the two-year period following the distribution, without obtaining the consent of Integra, a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or an unqualified opinion of a nationally recognized law firm, we are prohibited from taking certain specified actions that could affect the treatment of the distribution.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business. Moreover, the Tax Matters Agreement also provides that we are responsible for any taxes imposed on Integra or any of its affiliates as a result of the failure of the distribution to qualify for favorable treatment under the Code if such failure is attributable to certain actions taken after the distribution by or in respect of us, any of our affiliates or our stockholders.\nWe are subject to continuing contingent liabilities of Integra.\nEven after our separation from Integra, there are several significant areas where Integra\u2019s liabilities may become our obligations. For example, under the Code and the related rules and regulations, each corporation that was a member of the Integra consolidated U.S. federal income tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the distribution is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the entire Integra consolidated tax reporting group for that taxable period. In addition, the Tax Matters Agreement allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the Integra consolidated tax reporting group between us and Integra. Pursuant to this allocation, we may be responsible for taxes that we would not have otherwise incurred, or that we would have incurred but in different amounts and/or at different times, on a standalone basis outside of the Integra consolidated group, and the amount of such taxes could be significant. If Integra is unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible, we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes.\nWe have overlapping board membership with Integra, which may lead to conflicting interests, and one of our directors continues to own a substantial amount of Integra common stock and equity awards covering Integra stock.\nSeveral of our board members also serve as board members of Integra. Our directors who are members of Integra\u2019s board\nof directors have fiduciary duties to Integra\u2019s stockholders, as well as fiduciary duties to our stockholders. In addition, several of our directors own or have rights to acquire Integra common stock (in at least one case, a substantial amount).\nAs a result of the foregoing, there may be the appearance of a conflict of interest and there is the potential for a conflict of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting both companies, such as when we or Integra consider acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for each company. In addition, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between Integra and us regarding the terms of the agreements governing our separation from Integra, the Tax Matters Agreement or under other agreements between Integra and us, including with respect to indemnification matters. From time to time, we may enter into transactions with Integra and/or its subsidiaries or other affiliates. There can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to us, Integra or any of our or their subsidiaries or affiliates as would be the case were there no overlapping board membership or ownership interest.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Results and Need for Financing\nOur sales volumes and our operating results may fluctuate.\nOur sales volumes and our operating results, including components of operating results, such as gross margin and cost of goods sold, may fluctuate from time to time, including over the course of a fiscal year, and such fluctuations could affect our stock price. Our operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to fluctuate from time to time in the future. Some of the factors that may cause these fluctuations include:\n\u2022\neconomic conditions worldwide, which could affect the ability of hospitals and other customers to purchase our products and could result in a reduction in elective and non-reimbursed operative procedures;\n\u2022\nincreased competition;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our existing products, as well as products in development, and the demand for, and pricing of, our products and the products of our competitors;\n\u2022\ncosts, benefits and timing of new product introductions;\n\u2022\nthe timing of or failure to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for new products;\n\u2022\nlost sales and other expenses resulting from stoppages in our or third parties\u2019 production, including as a result of product recalls or field corrective actions;\n\u2022\nthe availability and cost of components and materials, including raw materials such as human tissue;\n\u2022\nour ability to purchase or manufacture and ship our products efficiently and in sufficient quantities to meet sales demands;\n\u2022\nthe timing of our research and development expenditures;\n\u2022\nexpenditures for major initiatives;\n\u2022\nreimbursement, changes in reimbursement or denials in coverage for our products by third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid, private and public health insurers and foreign governmental health systems;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our independent sales agents and stocking distributors to achieve expected sales targets and for new agents and distributors to become familiar with our products in a timely manner;\n\u2022\npeer-reviewed publications discussing the clinical effectiveness of our products;\n\u2022\ninspections of our manufacturing facilities for compliance with Quality System Regulations (Good Manufacturing Practices), which could result in Form 483 observations, warning letters, injunctions or other adverse findings from the FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory bodies, and corrective actions, procedural changes and other actions, including product recalls, that we determine are necessary or appropriate to address the results of those inspections, any of which may affect production and our ability to supply our customers with our products;\n\u2022\nthe costs to comply with new regulations from the FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory bodies, such as the requirements to establish a unique device identification system to adequately identify medical devices through their distribution and use;\n\u2022\nthe increased regulatory scrutiny of certain of our products, including products we manufacture for others, which could result in their being removed from the market;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of acquisitions, including the impact of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, if future operating results of the acquired businesses are significantly less than the results anticipated at the time of the acquisitions.\nIn addition, we may experience meaningful variability in our sales and gross profit among quarters, as well as within each quarter, as a result of a number of factors, including but not limited to (and in addition to those listed above):\n\u2022\nthe number of products sold in the quarter;\n\u2022\nthe unpredictability of sales of full sets of spinal implants and instruments to our international stocking distributors; and\n\u2022\nthe number of selling days in the quarter.\nOur future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future, and such funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe believe that our cash and the borrowing capacity that we have under the credit facility that we entered into in December 2015 will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements over the next 12 months. That said, continued expansion of our business will be expensive, and we may seek additional capital. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe revenue generated by sales of our products;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with expanding our sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nthe expenses we incur in procuring, manufacturing and selling our products;\n\u2022\nthe scope, rate of progress and cost of our clinical studies;\n\u2022\nthe cost of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval or clearance of our products and products in development;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with complying with state, federal and international laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nthe cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications and defending and enforcing our patent and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe cost of defending, in litigation or otherwise, any claims that we infringe third-party patent or other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe cost of enforcing or defending against non-competition claims;\n\u2022\nthe number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with increased capital expenditures, including fixed asset purchases of instrument sets which we consign to hospitals and independent sales agents to support surgeries; and\n\u2022\nanticipated and unanticipated general and administrative expenses, including insurance expenses.\nAs a result of these factors, we may seek to raise additional capital to:\n\u2022\nmaintain, and, where necessary, increase appropriate product inventory levels;\n\u2022\nfund our operations and clinical studies;\n\u2022\ncontinue, and, where appropriate, increase our research and development activities;\n\u2022\nfile, prosecute and defend our intellectual property rights, and defend, in litigation or otherwise, any claims that we infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\naddress the FDA or other governmental, legal or enforcement actions and remediate underlying problems and address investigations or inquiries into sales and marketing practices from governmental agencies worldwide;\n\u2022\ncommercialize our new products, if any such products receive regulatory clearance or approval for sale; and\n\u2022\nacquire companies new products, technology or intellectual property.\nSuch capital, which we may seek to raise through public or private equity offerings, issuing debt or existing, expanded or new credit facilities, or other sources, may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, our December 2015 credit agreement prohibits us from incurring indebtedness without the lender\u2019s consent. If we issue equity securities to raise additional capital, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. See \u201cRisks Relating to Owning Our Common Stock-Your percentage of ownership in us may be diluted in the future and issuances of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that such issuances may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly, even if our business is performing well.,\u201d and \u201cRisks Relating to Owning Our Common Stock-We may issue preferred stock with terms that could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock,\u201d below. If we raise additional capital through collaboration, licensing or other similar arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our products, potential products or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we cannot raise capital on acceptable terms, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products, execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, changes in our supplier relationships or unanticipated customer requirements. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve our business and financial goals or to achieve or maintain profitability, and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur future financial results could be adversely affected by impairments or other charges, including as a result of the high levels of inventory we maintain, which could consume a significant amount of our resources and reduce our cash flows.\nBecause we maintain substantial inventory levels to meet the needs of our customers, we are subject to the risk of inventory excess, obsolescence and shelf-life expiration. Many of our spine hardware products come in sets. Each set includes a significant number of components in various sizes so that the surgeon may select the appropriate spinal implant based on the patient\u2019s needs. In a typical surgery, not all of the implants in the set are used, and therefore certain sizes of implants placed in the set or that we purchase for replenishment inventory may become obsolete before they can be used. In addition, in order to market our products effectively, we often must provide hospitals and independent sales agents with consigned sets that typically consist of spinal implants and instruments, including products to ensure redundancy and products of different sizes. Further, the use of our orthobiologics products is limited by the sterilization expiration date, which ranges from one to five years. Therefore, these products may expire before they can be used. If a substantial portion of our inventory is deemed excess, becomes obsolete or expires, we may be required to incur impairment charges that could have a material and adverse effect on our financial results.\nFurther, we assess periodically impairment of our long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. As of December 31, 2015, we had $39.6 million of net finite-lived intangible assets, consisting of technology and customer relationships. In addition, we continually assess the profitability of our product lines and, after such assessment, may discontinue certain products or product lines in the future. As a result, we may record impairment charges or accelerate amortization on certain technology-related intangible assets in the future. Impairment charges as a result of any of the foregoing could be significant and could have a material and adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken, which could have a material and adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nCertain of our historical financial information may not be representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent public company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nFor periods prior to our separation from Integra, financial information included in this Form 10-K may not necessarily reflect what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows would have been had we been an independent entity during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future. The costs and expenses reflected in these prior periods include an allocation for certain corporate functions historically provided by Integra, including shared services and infrastructure provided by Integra to us, such as costs for IT, including the costs of a multi-year global implementation of a enterprise resource planning system, accounting and legal services, real estate and facilities, corporate advertising, insurance services and related treasury, and other corporate and infrastructure services that may be different from the comparable expenses that we would have incurred had we operated as an independent public company. Financial data presented as of and for these periods does not reflect changes in our cost structure and operations as a result of operating as an independent public company, including changes in our employee base, increased costs associated with reduced economies of scale and increased costs associated with SEC reporting and requirements. Accordingly, financial data as of and for these periods should not be assumed to be indicative of what our financial condition or results of operations actually would have been as an independent public company or to be a reliable indicator of what our financial condition or results of operations actually could be in the future.\nContinuing economic instability, including challenges faced by European countries, may adversely affect the ability of hospitals and other customers to access funds or otherwise have available liquidity, which could reduce orders for our products or impede our ability to obtain new customers, particularly in European markets.\nContinuing economic instability, including challenges faced by European countries, may adversely affect the ability of hospitals and other customers to access funds to enable them to fund their operating budgets. As a result, hospitals and other customers may reduce budgets or put all or part of their budgets on hold or close their operations, which could have a negative effect on our sales and could impede our ability to obtain new customers, particularly in European markets. Governmental austerity policies in Europe and other markets have reduced and could continue to reduce the amount of money available to purchase medical products, including our products. If such conditions persist, they could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Regulatory Environment\nWe are subject to stringent domestic and foreign medical device regulation and any adverse regulatory action may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.\nOur products, development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by numerous federal and state government agencies, including the FDA and comparable foreign agencies. To varying degrees, each\nof these agencies monitors and enforces our compliance with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our products. For example, we are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, which mandates that manufacturers of medical devices adhere to certain quality assurance standards pertaining to, among other things, validation of manufacturing processes, controls for purchasing product components and documentation practices.\nIn addition, we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting. For example, the Federal Medical Device Reporting regulation requires us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or that a malfunction occurred that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury upon recurrence.\nCompliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and we must make our manufacturing facilities and records available for periodic unscheduled inspections by governmental agencies, including the FDA, state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries. If we fail to pass an FDA Quality System Regulation inspection or to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may receive a notice of a violation in the form of inspectional observations on Form FDA 483, a warning letter, or could otherwise be required to take corrective action and, in severe cases, we could suffer a disruption of our operations and manufacturing delays. If we fail to take adequate corrective actions, we could be subject to enforcement actions, including significant fines, suspension of approvals, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions.\nThe FDA has been increasing its scrutiny of the medical device industry and the government is expected to continue to scrutinize the industry closely. Moreover, allegations may be made against us or against our suppliers, including donor recovery groups or tissue banks, claiming that the acquisition or processing of biomaterials products does not comply with applicable FDA regulations or other relevant statutes and regulations. Allegations like these could cause regulators or other authorities to investigate or take other action against us or our suppliers, or could cause negative publicity for us or our industry generally. If the FDA were to investigate us, because of an allegation or otherwise, and if the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could ban such medical devices, detain or seize such medical devices, order a recall, repair, replacement or refund of such devices, require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health, restrict manufacturing and impose other operating restrictions, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees or us. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any notice or communication from the FDA regarding a failure to comply with applicable requirements, or negative publicity or product liability claims resulting from any adverse regulatory action, could materially and adversely affect our product sales and overall business.\nFurther, our suppliers also are subject to a wide array of regulatory and other requirements, including quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Our suppliers may be unable to comply with these requirements and with other FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements. We have little control over their ongoing compliance with these regulations. Their failure to comply may expose us to regulatory action and other liability, including fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in new product approval or clearance, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval or clearance.\nForeign governmental regulations have become increasingly stringent and more common, and we may become subject to even more rigorous regulation by foreign governmental authorities in the future. Penalties for a company\u2019s noncompliance with foreign governmental regulation could be severe, including revocation or suspension of a company\u2019s business license and criminal sanctions. Any domestic or foreign governmental medical device law or regulation imposed in the future may have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and business operations.\nThere is no guarantee that the FDA will grant 510(k) clearance or premarket approval, or that equivalent foreign regulatory authorities will grant the foreign equivalent, of our future products, and failure to obtain necessary clearances or approvals for our future products would adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nIn general, unless an exemption applies, a medical device and modifications to the device or its indications must receive either premarket approval or premarket clearance from the FDA before it can be marketed in the U.S. While in the past we have received such clearances, we may not be successful in the future in receiving approvals and clearances in a timely manner, or at all. The process of obtaining approval or clearance from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies for new products, or for enhancements or modifications to existing products, could:\n\u2022\ntake a significant amount of time;\n\u2022\nrequire the expenditure of substantial resources;\n\u2022\ninvolve rigorous and expensive pre-clinical and clinical testing, as well as post-market surveillance;\n\u2022\ninvolve modifications, repairs or replacements of our products; and\n\u2022\nresult in limitations on the indicated uses of our products.\nSome of our new products will require FDA 510(k) clearance or approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA, prior to being marketed. Any modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, including significant design and manufacturing changes, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, design or manufacture, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, possibly, approval of a PMA. Similarly, modifications to PMA-approved products may require submission and approval of a supplement PMA. The FDA requires every manufacturer to determine whether a new 510(k) or supplement PMA is needed in the first instance, and the FDA has issued guidance on assessing modifications to 510(k)-cleared and PMA-approved devices to assist manufacturers with making these determinations. However, the FDA may review any such determination and the FDA may not agree with our determinations regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary. We have modified some of our 510(k)-cleared products and have determined, based on our understanding of FDA guidance, that certain changes did not require new 510(k) clearances. If the FDA disagrees with our determination and requires us to seek new 510(k) clearances, or PMA approval, for modifications to our previously cleared products, we may be required to stop marketing or distributing our products, we may need to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. Significant delays in receiving clearance or approval, or the failure to receive clearance or approval for our new products would have a material and adverse effect on our ability to expand our business.\nOutside the U.S., clearance or approval procedures can vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain clearance or approval in other countries might differ from that required to obtain FDA clearance or approval. The regulatory process in other countries may include all of the risks to which we are exposed in the U.S., as well as other risks. Favorable regulatory action in one country does not ensure favorable regulatory action in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory clearance or approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. Failure to obtain clearance or approval in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such clearance or approval have a material and adverse effect on our business, including that our products may not be cleared or approved for all indications requested, which could limit the uses of our products and have an adverse effect on product sales.\nIn the EEA, we must inform the Notified Body that carried out the conformity assessment of the medical devices we market or sell in the EEA of any planned substantial change to our quality system or any change to our devices that could affect compliance with the Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Directive or the devices\u2019 intended purpose. The Notified Body will then assess the change and verify whether it affects the products\u2019 conformity with the Essential Requirements or the conditions for the use of the device. If the assessment is favorable, the Notified Body will issue a new CE Certificate of Conformity or an addendum to the existing CE Certificate of Conformity attesting compliance with the Essential Requirements. If it is not, we may not be able to continue to market and sell the applicable product in the EEA, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe cannot be certain that we will receive required approval or clearance from the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies for new products, including modifications to existing products, on a timely basis, or at all. The failure to receive approval or clearance for new on a timely basis would have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our products are derived from human tissue and are or could be subject to additional regulations and requirements.\nSome of our orthobiologics products are derived from human bone tissue, and as a result are also subject to FDA and certain state regulations regarding human cells, tissues and cellular or tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps. An HCT/P is a product containing or consisting of human cells or tissue intended for transplantation into a human patient. Examples include bone, ligament, skin and cornea.\nSome HCT/Ps also meet the definition of a biological product, medical device or drug regulated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act authorizes the FDA to issue regulations to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable disease. HCT/Ps regulated as \u201c361 HCT/Ps\u201d are subject to requirements relating to registering facilities and listing products with the FDA, screening and testing for tissue donor eligibility, Good Tissue Practice when processing, storing, labeling and distributing HCT/Ps, including required labeling information, stringent record keeping and adverse event reporting. These biologic, device or drug HCT/Ps must comply both with the requirements exclusively applicable to 361 HCT/Ps and, in addition, with requirements applicable to biologics, devices or drugs, including premarket clearance or approval. We have received required approvals for our products that are regulated as 361 HCT/Ps. However, there\nhave been occasions in the past, and there could be occasions in the future, when the FDA requires us to obtain a 510(k) clearance for our products that are regulated as 361 HCT/Ps. The process of obtaining a 510(k) clearance could take time and consume resources, and the failure to receive such a clearance would render us unable to market and sell such products, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nThe American Association of Tissue Banks has issued operating standards for tissue banking. Accreditation is voluntary, but compliance with these standards is a requirement in order to become a licensed tissue bank. In addition, some states have their own tissue banking regulations. In addition, procurement of certain human organs and tissue for transplantation is subject to the National Organ Transplant Act, or NOTA, which prohibits the transfer of certain human organs, including skin and related tissue, for valuable consideration, but permits the reasonable payment associated with the removal, transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control and storage of human tissue and skin. We reimburse tissue banks for their expenses associated with the recovery, storage and transportation of donated human tissue that they provide to us for processing. We include in our pricing structure amounts paid to tissue banks to reimburse them for their expenses associated with the recovery and transportation of the tissue, in addition to certain costs associated with processing, preservation, quality control and storage of the tissue, marketing and medical education expenses and costs associated with development of tissue processing technologies. NOTA payment allowances may be interpreted to limit the amount of costs and expenses that we can recover in our pricing for our products, thereby reducing our future revenue and profitability. If we were to be found to have violated NOTA\u2019s prohibition on the sale or transfer of human tissue for valuable consideration, we would potentially be subject to criminal enforcement sanctions, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nBecause of the absence of a harmonized regulatory framework and the proposed regulation for advanced therapy medicinal products in the European Union, or EU, as well as for other countries, the approval process in the EU for human-derived cell or tissue-based medical products could be extensive, lengthy, expensive and unpredictable. Among others, some of our orthobiologics products are subject to EU member states\u2019 regulations that govern the donation, procurement, testing, coding, traceability, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of HCT/Ps. These EU member states\u2019 regulations include requirements for registration, listing, labeling, adverse-event reporting and inspection and enforcement. Some EU member states have their own tissue banking regulations. Non-compliance with various regulations governing our products in any EU member state could result in the banning of our products in such member state or enforcement actions being brought against us, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of our products contain materials derived from animal sources and may become subject to additional regulation.\nCertain of our products contain material derived from bovine tissue. Products that contain materials derived from animal sources, including food, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, are subject to scrutiny in the media and by regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities are concerned about the potential for the transmission of disease from animals to humans via those materials. This public scrutiny has been particularly acute in Japan and Western Europe with respect to products derived from animal sources, largely due to concern that materials infected with the agent that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, otherwise known as mad cow disease, may, if ingested or implanted, cause a variant of the human Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, an ultimately fatal disease with no known cure. Cases of BSE in cattle discovered in Canada and the U.S. have increased awareness of the issue in North America.\nWe take steps designed to minimize the risk that our products contain agents that can cause disease, such as obtaining our collagen from countries considered to be BSE-free. Nevertheless, products that contain materials derived from animals, including our products, could become subject to additional regulation, or even be banned in certain countries, because of concern over the potential for the transmission of infectious or other agents. Significant new regulation, or a ban of our products, could have a material and adverse effect on our current business or our ability to expand our business.\nCertain countries, such as Japan, China, Taiwan and Argentina, have already issued regulations that require our collagen products be processed from bovine tendon sourced from countries where no cases of BSE have occurred. The collagen raw material we use in our products is sourced from New Zealand. Our supplier has obtained approval from certain countries, including the U.S., the European Union, Japan, Taiwan, China and Argentina, for the use of such collagen raw material in products sold in those countries. If we cannot continue to obtain collagen raw material from a qualified source of tendon from a country that has never had a case of BSE, we will not be permitted to sell our collagen products in certain countries, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nClinical studies are expensive and subject to extensive regulation and their results may not support our product candidate claims or may result in the discovery of adverse effects.\nIn the development of new products or new indications for, or modifications to, existing products, we may conduct or sponsor\npre-clinical testing, clinical studies or other clinical research. We are currently conducting post-market clinical studies of some of our products to gather information about their performance or optimal use. The data collected from these clinical studies may ultimately be used to support additional market clearance or approval for these products or future products. If any of our new products require premarket clinical studies, these studies are expensive, the outcomes are inherently uncertain and they are subject to extensive regulation and review by numerous governmental authorities both in the U.S. and abroad, including by the FDA and, if federal funds are involved or if an investigator or site has signed a federal assurance, are subject to further regulation by the Office for Human Research Protections and the National Institutes of Health. For example, clinical studies must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations, local regulations, and according to principles and standards collectively referred to as \u201cGood Clinical Practices.\u201d Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in regulatory and legal enforcement action, including fines, penalties, suspension of studies, and also could invalidate the data and make it unusable to support a FDA submission.\nEven if any of our future premarket clinical studies are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our product candidates and/or proposed claims or that the FDA or foreign authorities and Notified Bodies will agree with our interpretation and conclusions regarding the data they generate. Success in pre-clinical studies and early clinical studies does not ensure that later clinical studies will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the results of later studies will replicate those of earlier or prior studies. The clinical study process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for the proposed indicated uses, which could cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of others. Any delay or termination of our clinical studies will delay the filing of our product submissions and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenues. It is also possible that patient subjects enrolled in our clinical studies of our marketed products will experience adverse side effects that are not currently part of the product candidate\u2019s profile and, if so, these findings may result in lower market acceptance, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the third parties on which we rely to conduct our clinical studies and to assist us with pre-clinical development do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance, approval or a CE Certificate of Conformity for or commercialize our products.\nWe often must rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories, to assist in conducting our clinical studies and other development activities. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, comply with applicable regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, or if these third parties need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to clinical protocols, to applicable regulatory requirements or otherwise, our pre-clinical development activities and clinical studies may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated. Under these circumstances we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance/approval or a CE Certificate of Conformity for, or successfully commercialize, our products on a timely basis, if at all, and our business, operating results and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nOversight of the medical device industry might affect the manner in which we may sell medical devices and compete in the marketplace.\nThe U.S. Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA, the U.S. Department of Justice and other regulatory agencies actively enforce regulations prohibiting the promotion of a medical device for a use that has not been cleared or approved by the FDA. Use of a device outside its cleared or approved indications is known as \u201coff-label\u201d use. Physicians may prescribe our products for off-label uses, as the FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician\u2019s choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. However, if a regulatory agency determines that our promotional materials, training or activities constitute improper promotion of an off-label use, the regulatory agency could request that we modify our promotional materials, training or activities, or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and/or criminal penalties. Although our policy is to refrain from statements and activities that could be considered off-label promotion of our products, any regulatory agency could disagree and conclude that we have engaged in off-label promotion and, potentially, caused the submission of false claims. In addition, the off-label use of our products may increase the risk of injury to patients, and, in turn, the risk of product liability claims. See \u201cRisks Relating to our Business-We may have significant product liability exposure and our insurance may not cover all potential claims,\u201d above.\nThere are also multiple other laws and regulations that govern the means by which companies in the healthcare industry may market their products to healthcare professionals and may compete by discounting the prices of their products, including, for example, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, state law equivalents to these federal laws that are meant to protect against fraud and abuse, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and analogous laws in foreign countries. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, but not limited to, penalties, fines and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and imprisonment. Federal and state government agencies, as well as private\nwhistleblowers, have significantly increased investigations and enforcement activity under these laws. Although we exercise care in structuring our sales and marketing practices, customer discount arrangements and interactions with healthcare professionals to comply with these laws and regulations, we cannot provide assurance that government officials will not assert that our practices are in compliance or that government regulators or courts will interpret those laws or regulations in a manner consistent with our interpretation. Even if an investigation is not successful or is not fully pursued, we may spend considerable time and resources defending ourselves and the adverse publicity surrounding any assertion that we may have engaged in violative conduct could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation with existing and potential customers and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal and state laws are also sometimes open to interpretation, and from time to time we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage if our interpretation differs from that of our competitors. AdvaMed (U.S.), EucoMed (Europe), MEDEC (Canada) and MTAA (Australia), some of the principal trade associations for the medical device industry, have promulgated model codes of ethics that set forth standards by which its members should (and non-member companies may) abide in the promotion of their products in various regions. We have implemented policies and procedures for compliance consistent with those promulgated by these associations, and we train our sales and marketing personnel on our policies regarding sales and marketing practices. Nevertheless, the sales and marketing practices of our industry have been the subject of increased scrutiny from federal and state government agencies, we believe this trend will continue and that it could affect our ability to retain customers and other relationships important to our business.\nFor example, prosecutorial scrutiny and governmental oversight, at both the state and federal levels, over some major device companies regarding the retention of healthcare professionals have limited the manner in which medical device companies may retain healthcare professionals as consultants. Various hospital organizations, medical societies and trade associations are establishing their own practices that may require detailed disclosures of relationships between healthcare professionals and medical device companies or ban or restrict certain marketing and sales practices, such as gifts and business meals. In addition, the Affordable Care Act, as well as certain state laws, require detailed disclosure of certain financial relationships, gifts and other remuneration made to certain healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals, the publicity surrounding which could have a negative impact on our relationships with our customers and ability to seek input on product design or involvement in research. As a result of laws, rules and regulations or our own or third-party policies that prohibit or restrict interactions, or the growing perception that any interaction between healthcare professionals and industry are tainted, we may be unable to engage with our healthcare professional customers in the same manner or to the same degree, or at all, as would otherwise be the case, which may adversely affect our ability to understand our customer\u2019s needs and to incorporate into our development programs feedback that addresses these needs. If we are unable to develop and commercialize new products that address the needs of our surgeon customers and their patients, our products may not be broadly accepted in the marketplace, or at all, which would have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnfavorable media reports or other negative publicity concerning both alleged improper methods of tissue recovery from donors and disease transmission from donated tissue could limit widespread acceptance of some of our products.\nUnfavorable reports of improper or illegal tissue recovery practices, both in the U.S. and internationally, as well as incidents of improperly processed tissue leading to the transmission of disease, may affect the rate of future tissue donation and market acceptance of technologies incorporating human tissue. In addition, negative publicity could cause the families of potential donors to become reluctant to agree to donate tissue to for-profit tissue processors. For example, the media has reported examples of alleged illegal harvesting of body parts from cadavers and resulting recalls conducted by certain companies selling human tissue based products affected by the alleged illegal harvesting. These reports and others could have a negative effect on our tissue regeneration business.\nOur international operations subject us to laws regarding sanctioned countries, entities and persons, customs and import-export practices, laws regarding transactions in foreign countries, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and local anti-bribery and other laws regarding interactions with healthcare professionals, and product registration requirements.\nNumerous laws restrict, and in some cases prohibit, U.S. companies from directly or indirectly selling goods, technology or services to people or entities in certain countries. In addition, these laws require that we exercise care in structuring our sales and marketing practices and effecting product registrations in foreign countries. Compliance with these regulations is costly. Any failure to comply with applicable foreign legal and regulatory obligations could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including the suspension or withdrawal of our CE Certificates of Conformity; the imposition of significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals and fines; disrupting our shipping activities, including denial of export privileges and seizure of shipments; requiring us to recall or withdraw products; imposing restrictions on our business activities; and disrupting our sales activities and adversely affect our overall business.\nNew regulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chain more\ncomplex and may result in damage to our reputation with customers.\nWe are subject to SEC regulations that require us to determine whether our products contain certain specified minerals, referred to under the regulations as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d and, if so, to perform an extensive inquiry into our supply chain, in an effort to determine whether or not such conflict minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo (\u201cDRC\u201d) or an adjoining country. Compliance with these regulations has increased our costs, and we expect our costs may increase in the future. We have determined that certain of our products contain such specified minerals. We are continuing to conduct inquiries into our supply chain in connection with the preparation of our conflict minerals report for 2016. Compliance with these requirements has been time-consuming for management and our supply chain personnel (as well as time-consuming for our suppliers), and we expect that compliance will continue to require the expenditure of significant amounts of time and money by us and them. In addition, to the extent any of our disclosures are perceived by the market to be \u201cnegative,\u201d it may cause customers to refuse to purchase our products. Further, if we determine to make any changes to products, processes, or sources of supply, it may result in additional costs, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\u201d\nWe are subject to requirements relating to hazardous materials which may impose significant compliance or other costs on us.\nOur research, development and manufacturing processes involve the controlled use of certain hazardous materials. In addition, we lease facilities at which hazardous materials could have been used in the past. For these reasons, we are subject to federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling, treatment, remediation and disposal of hazardous materials and certain waste products. For example, our allograft bone tissue processing may generate waste materials that in the U.S. are classified as medical waste. Although we believe that our procedures for handling and disposing of hazardous materials comply with applicable laws as currently in effect, new laws may become effective, or existing laws may be amended in ways, that increase our cost of compliance, in some cases materially.\nFurthermore, there is a risk that accidental contamination or injury has occurred in connection with one of our facilities. If such accidental contamination or injury occurred, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any related liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our insurance and could exceed our resources. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms or at all, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nOur intellectual property rights may not provide meaningful commercial protection for our products, potentially enabling third parties to use our technology or very similar technology in ways that could reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other exclusivity with respect to our products; prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights; maintain proprietary know-how and trade secrets; operate without infringing upon the patents and proprietary rights of others; and obtain appropriate licenses to patents or proprietary rights held by third parties if infringement would otherwise occur, both in the U.S. and in foreign countries.\nWe own or have licensed patents that cover aspects of some of our product lines. Our patents, however, may not provide us with any significant competitive advantage. Others may challenge our patents and, as a result, our patents could be narrowed, invalidated or rendered unenforceable. Competitors may develop products similar to ours that our patents do not cover. In addition, our current and future patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents in the U.S. or foreign countries. Further, there is a substantial backlog of patent applications at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and the approval or rejection of patent applications may take several years.\nIn an effort to protect our trade secrets, we require our employees, consultants and advisors to execute confidentiality and invention assignment agreements upon commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that, except in specified circumstances, all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of their relationship with us must be kept confidential. We cannot assure you, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of the unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information. In addition, we cannot assure you that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and procedures or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, that our trade secrets will not be disclosed or that we can otherwise protect our rights to unpatented trade secrets.\nIf we are unable to obtain, protect and enforce patents on our technology and to protect our trade secrets, such inability could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success will depend partly on our ability to operate without infringing or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others.\nTo protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we may have to initiate or defend litigation against or by third parties, such as infringement suits, opposition proceedings or seeking a court declaration that we do not infringe the proprietary rights of others or that their rights are invalid or unenforceable. Litigation is expensive, time-consuming and could divert management attention and resources away from our business. Even if we prevail, the cost of litigation could affect our profitability.\nIf we do not prevail in any litigation, in addition to any damages we might have to pay, we may be required to stop the infringing activity (which could include requiring us to stop selling the products in question) or obtain a license for the proprietary rights involved. Any required license may be unavailable to us on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, some licenses may be nonexclusive, in which case our competitors could access the same proprietary rights we license. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design our products so as not to infringe on the proprietary rights of others, we may be unable to sell some of our products, which could have a material and adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nRisks Relating to Owning Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been and likely will continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, these factors include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial condition and operating performance;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u2022\na shift in our investor base, including sales of our shares by existing stockholders;;\n\u2022\nany major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022\nthreatened or actual litigation or governmental investigations;\n\u2022\nthe number of shares of our common stock publicly owned and available for trading;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of similar companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet earnings guidance;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us or our industry or changes in recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations affecting our business, including tax legislation;\n\u2022\nthe success or failure of our business strategy;\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of us and our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nthe overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\ngeneral political and economic conditions, and other external factors.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for medical device companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. This could limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, and harm our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nYour percentage of ownership in us may be diluted in the future and issuances of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that such issuances may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly, even if our business is performing well.\nAs with any public company, your percentage ownership in us may be diluted in the future because of equity issuances for acquisitions and investments, capital-raising transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that we have granted and we expect to grant to our directors, officers and employees. For example, in connection with our separation from Integra, we granted to certain Integra directors and officers equity awards equivalent to approximately 1.9% of our then-outstanding common stock and granted to our directors stock option awards equivalent to approximately 2.6% of our then-outstanding common stock. Further, the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of the issuance, including sale, of a large number of shares of our\ncommon stock, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market price of our common stock. A decline in the price of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we are taking advantage of certain exemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies. In particular, while we are an emerging growth company: (i) we will not be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of SOX; (ii) we will be exempt from any rules that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotations or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report on financial statements; (iii) we will be subject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and (iv) we will not be required to hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nIn addition, as an emerging growth company we are not required to comply with any new or revised accounting standard applicable to public companies until such date that a private company is required to comply with such standard. We elected not to comply with such new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies, therefore our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of: (i) December 31, 2020 (the fiscal year-end following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the spin-off); (ii) the end of the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of that year; (iii) the end of the fiscal year in which our annual revenues exceed $1.0 billion; and (iv) the date on which we issue more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt in any three-year period.\nThe exact implications of the JOBS Act are still subject to interpretations and guidance by the SEC and other regulatory agencies, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to take advantage of all of the benefits of the JOBS Act. In addition, investors may find our common stock less attractive because we rely on the exemptions available to, and relief granted to, emerging growth companies by the JOBS Act. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may decline and/or become more volatile.\nIf, once we are no longer an emerging growth company, our independent registered public accounting firm cannot provide an unqualified attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investor confidence and, in turn, the market price of our common stock, could decline.\nWe may issue preferred stock with terms that could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock.\nWhile we have no specific plan to issue preferred stock, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without stockholder approval, one or more series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, privileges, preferences, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, terms of redemption and relative participation, optional, or other rights, if any, of the shares of each such series of preferred stock and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If current or future analysts who cover us were to downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts were to stop covering us or were to stop regularly publishing reports on us, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends, and accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nWe have paid no cash dividends on any of our common stock to date, and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, with respect to our common stock, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and payment of cash dividends, if any, will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and other factors and will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Furthermore, we are subject to various laws and regulations that may restrict our ability to pay dividends and are subject to contractual restrictions on, or prohibitions against, the payment of dividends. Due to our intent to retain any future earnings rather than pay cash dividends on our common stock and applicable laws, regulations and contractual obligations that may restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock, the success of your investment in our common stock will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation and our common stock may not appreciate. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock.\nCertain provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment and, therefore, may depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors, including, among other things:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to determine to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or by the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, our chief executive officer, our president (in absence of a chief executive officer) or our board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2\u20443% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of our voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to the issuance of preferred stock and management of our business or our amended and restated bylaws, which may inhibit the ability of an acquirer from amending our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws to facilitate a hostile acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors, by majority vote, to amend our amended and restated bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent a hostile acquisition and inhibit the ability of an acquirer from amending our amended and restated bylaws to facilitate a hostile acquisition; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nWe believe that these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or harmful takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with adequate time to assess any acquisition proposal. However, these provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control that is in the best interest of our stockholders. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging future takeover attempts.\nWe are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions under the DGCL. Under the DGCL, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three\nyears or, among other things, our board of directors has approved the transaction.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees or our stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws; or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation further provides that any person or entity purchasing or acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions described above. These provisions may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.", "PERMNO": 15407, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "SPNE"}
