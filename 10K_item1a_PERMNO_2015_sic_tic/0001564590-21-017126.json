When evaluating our business, the following information should be carefully considered in conjunction with the other information contained in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us currently or that currently we deem to be immaterial also may impair our business operations. Immediately below is a summary of the principal factors that might cause our future operating results to differ materially from those currently expected. The risk factors summarized below are not the only risks facing us. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in the \u201cRisk Factor Summary,\u201d as well as other risks that may affect our business and operating results, can be found below under the heading \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d and should be carefully considered and evaluated before making an investment decision regarding our business. If we are unable to prevent events that have a negative effect from occurring, then our business may suffer. Negative events are likely to decrease our revenue, increase our costs, negatively impact our financial results and/or decrease our financial strength, and may cause our stock price to decline.\nRisk Factors Summary\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic:\n\u2022\nCOVID-19 has had a significant adverse impact on occupancy levels, revenues, expenses and operating results at our communities. Because we are unable to predict the full nature and extent of the impact of COVID-19 at this time, COVID-19 may continue to have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Liquidity and Indebtedness:\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to successfully implement our business plans and strategies, our consolidated results of operations, financial position, liquidity and ability to continue as a going concern could be negatively affected.\n\u2022\nWe have significant debt and our failure to generate cash flow sufficient to cover required interest and principal payments could result in defaults of the related debt.\n\u2022\nOur failure to comply with financial covenants and other restrictions contained in our debt instruments could result in the acceleration of the related debt or in the exercise of other remedies.\n\u2022\nWe will require additional financing and/or refinancing actions in the future and may issue equity securities.\n\u2022\nIncreases in market interest rates and/or the Consumer Price Index (\u201cCPI\u201d) could significantly increase the costs of our floating rate debt obligations, which could adversely affect our liquidity and earnings.\n\u2022\nThe phasing out of London Inter-Bank Offer Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) may increase the interest costs of our debt obligations, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Operations and Strategy:\n\u2022\nWe have incurred losses from operations in each of the last three fiscal years and may do so in the future.\n\u2022\nWe largely rely on private pay residents and circumstances that adversely affect the ability of the seniors to pay for our services could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\u2022\nThe senior living services industry is very competitive and some competitors may have substantially greater financial resources than us.\n\u2022\nTermination of resident agreements and resident attrition could affect adversely our revenues and earnings.\n\u2022\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2020. If we are unable to remediate this material weakness, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\n\u2022\nThere is an inherent risk of liability in the provision of personal and health care services, not all of which may be covered by insurance.\n\u2022\nDamage from catastrophic weather and other natural events have resulted in losses and adversely affected certain of our residents.\n\u2022\nWe rely on information technology in our operations, and failure to maintain the security and functionality of our information technology and computer systems, or to prevent a cybersecurity attack, breach or other unauthorized access, could adversely affect our business, reputation and relationships with our residents, employees and referral sources and may subject us to remediation costs, government inquiries and liabilities under HIPAA and data and consumer protection laws, any of which could materially and adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\n\u2022\nBecause we do not presently have plans to pay dividends on our common stock, stockholders must look solely to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment.\nRisks Related to Human Capital:\n\u2022\nWe rely on the services of key executive officers and the transition of management or loss of these officers or their services could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\u2022\nA significant increase in our labor costs could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to risks related to the provision for employee health care benefits and ongoing health care reform legislation.\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Compliance and/or Legal Matters:\n\u2022\nWe are subject to government regulations and compliance, some of which are burdensome and some of which may change to our detriment in the future.\n\u2022\nWe may be subject to liability for environmental damages.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Organization and Structure:\n\u2022\nAnti-takeover provisions in our governing documents, governing law and material agreements may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable or prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management.\n\u2022\nWe are a holding company with no operations and rely on our operating subsidiaries to provide us with funds necessary to meet our financial obligations.\nRisks Related to Other Market Factors:\n\u2022\nIf we cannot regain compliance with the continued listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d), the NYSE will delist our common stock.\n\u2022\nFuture offerings of equity securities by us may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n\u2022\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially over the past several years and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future.\n\u2022\nActions of activist stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, and the market price of our common stock.\n\u2022\nVarious factors, including general economic conditions, could adversely affect our financial performance and other aspects of our business.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nCOVID-19 has had a significant adverse impact on occupancy levels, revenues, expenses and operating results at our communities. Because we are unable to predict the full nature and extent of the impact of COVID-19 at this time, COVID-19 may continue to have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe face risks related to an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis. COVID-19 was declared a public health emergency in the United States in response to the outbreak and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stated that older adults are at a higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19. The United States broadly continues to experience the pandemic caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has significantly disrupted the nation\u2019s economy, the senior living industry, and our business.\nIn an effort to protect our residents and employees and slow the spread of COVID-19 and in response to quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and other limitations imposed by federal, state and local governments, we restricted or limited access to our communities, including limitations on in-person prospective resident tours and, in certain cases, new resident admissions. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a decline in the occupancy levels at our communities, which has negatively impacted our revenues and operating results, which depend significantly on such occupancy levels. During March 2020, new resident leads, visits, and move-in activity began to decline compared to historical levels. This trend continued through the end of 2020, and adversely impacted occupancy, resulting in a decrease in consolidated senior housing occupancy decreasing from 79.9% for the first quarter of 2020 to 73.3% for the fourth quarter of 2020. We cannot predict with reasonable certainty whether or when demand for senior living communities will return to pre-COVID-19 levels or the extent to which the pandemic\u2019s effect on demand may adversely affect the amount of resident fee revenue we are able to collect from our residents.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 outbreak has required us to incur significant additional operating costs and expenses in order to care for our residents. Further, residents at certain of our senior housing communities have tested positive for COVID-19, which has increased the costs of caring for the residents at such communities and has resulted in reduced occupancies at such communities. During March 2020, we began to incur incremental direct costs to prepare for and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes $9.4 million of incremental and direct costs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including costs for acquisition of additional PPE, cleaning and disposable food service supplies, testing of our residents and employees, enhanced cleaning and environmental sanitation costs, and increased labor expense. We are unable to reasonably predict the total amount of costs we will ultimately incur related to the pandemic, but such costs are likely to be substantial.\nAs a result, COVID-19 had a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations and has contributed to management concluding that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months after the date on which our fiscal year 2020 financial statements are issued.\nFurther, the grants received by us from the CARES Act Provider Relief Fund are subject to the terms and conditions of the program, including that such funds may only be used to prevent, prepare for, and respond to COVID-19 and will reimburse only for healthcare related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to COVID-19 and have not been reimbursed from other sources or that other sources are not obligated to reimburse. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services continues to evaluate and provide regulation and guidance regarding grants made under the CARES Act Provider Relief Fund. We cannot provide assurance that additional restrictions on the permissible uses or terms and conditions of the grants will not be imposed by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The program requires us to report to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on our use of the grants, and our reporting is subject to audit.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also caused substantial volatility in the market prices and trading volumes in the equity markets, including our stock. Our stock price and trading volume may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations as a result of the pandemic, and may decline in the future.\nThe ultimate impacts of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, and stock price will depend on many factors, some of which cannot be foreseen, including the duration, severity, and geographic concentrations of the pandemic and any resurgence of the disease; the impact of COVID-19 on the nation\u2019s economy and debt and equity markets and the local economies in our markets; the development and availability of COVID-19 infection and antibody testing, therapeutic agents, and vaccines and the prioritization of such resources among businesses and demographic groups; government financial and regulatory relief efforts that may become available to business and\nindividuals; perceptions regarding the safety of senior living communities during and after the pandemic; changes in demand for senior living communities and our ability to adapt our sales and marketing efforts to meet that demand; the impact of COVID-19 on our residents\u2019 and their families\u2019 ability to afford our resident fees, including due to changes in unemployment rates, consumer confidence, and equity markets caused by COVID-19; changes in the acuity levels of our new residents; the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on seniors generally and those residing in our communities; the duration and costs of our preparation and response efforts, including increased supplies, labor, litigation, and other expenses; the impact of COVID-19 on our ability to complete financings, re-financings, or other transactions (including dispositions) or to generate sufficient cash flow to cover required interest and lease payments and to satisfy financial and other covenants in our debt and lease documents; increased regulatory requirements and enforcement actions resulting from COVID-19, including those that may limit our collection efforts for delinquent accounts; and the frequency and magnitude of legal actions and liability claims that may arise due to COVID-19 or our response efforts.\nRisks Related to Our Liquidity and Indebtedness\nIf we are unable to successfully implement our business plans and strategies, our consolidated results of operations, financial position, liquidity and ability to continue as a going concern could be negatively affected.\nAs noted elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial position and our upcoming debt maturities, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We have taken, and intend to take, actions to improve our liquidity position and to address the uncertainty about our ability to operate as a going concern, but these actions are subject to a number of assumptions, projections, and analyses. If these assumptions prove to be incorrect, we may be unsuccessful in executing our business plans or achieving the projected results, which could adversely impact our financial results and liquidity. Those plans include various cost-cutting, efficiency and profitability initiatives. There are no assurances such initiatives will prove to be successful or the cost savings, profitability or other results we achieve through those plans will be consistent with our expectations. As a result, our results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be negatively impacted. If we become insolvent or fail to continue as a going concern, our common stock may become worthless.\nWe have significant debt and our failure to generate cash flow sufficient to cover required interest and principal payments could result in defaults of the related debt.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had mortgage and other indebtedness, excluding deferred loan costs, totaling approximately $915.2 million, of which, $72.5 million is maturing in 2021. We cannot assure you that we will generate cash flow from operations or receive proceeds from refinancing activities, other financings or the sales of assets sufficient to cover required interest and principal payments. Any payment or other default could cause the applicable lender to foreclose upon the communities securing the indebtedness with a consequent loss of income and asset value to us. Further, because some of our mortgages contain cross-default and cross-collateralization provisions, a payment or other default by us with respect to one community could affect a significant number of our other communities.\nOur failure to comply with financial covenants and other restrictions contained in our debt instruments could result in the acceleration of the related debt or in the exercise of other remedies.\nOur outstanding indebtedness is secured by our communities, and, in certain cases, a guaranty by us or by one or more of our subsidiaries. Therefore, an event of default under the outstanding indebtedness, subject to cure provisions in certain instances, would give the respective lenders, the right to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable, or foreclose on collateral securing the outstanding indebtedness.\nThere are various financial covenants and other restrictions in certain of our debt instruments, including provisions which:\n\u2022\nrequire us to meet specified financial tests at the subsidiary company level, which include, but are not limited to, tangible net worth requirements;\n\u2022\nrequire us to meet specified financial tests at the community level;\n\u2022\nrequire us to maintain the physical condition of the community and meet certain minimum spending levels for capital and leasehold improvements; and\n\u2022\nrequire consent for changes in control of us.\nIf we fail to comply with any of these requirements, then the related indebtedness could become due and payable prior to their stated dates. We cannot assure that we could pay these debt obligations if they became due prior to their stated dates.\nPursuant to the forbearance agreements described in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Transactions Involving Certain Fannie Mae Loans,\u201d we withheld loan payments due under loan agreements with Fannie Mae covering certain of our communities for the months of April through December of 2020. In addition, we were not in compliance with certain financial covenants of our loan agreements with Fifth Third Bank covering two properties and our loan with BBVA, USA (\u201cBBVA\u201d) covering three properties as of December 31, 2020 and as a result of default, the debt has become callable. We are in active discussions with Fifth Third Bank and BBVA to resolve these defaults. However, we cannot give any assurance that a mutually agreeable resolution will be reached.\nWe will require additional financing and/or refinancing actions in the future and may issue equity securities.\nOur ability to obtain such financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. Our ability to meet our long-term capital requirements, including the repayment of certain long-term debt obligations, will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain additional financing or refinancings on acceptable terms from available financing sources, including through the use of mortgage financing, joint venture arrangements, by accessing the debt and/or equity markets and possibly through operating leases or other types of financing, such as lines of credit. Turmoil in the financial markets can severely restrict the availability of funds for borrowing and may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital. There can be no assurance that financing or refinancings will be available or that, if available, will be on terms acceptable to us. Moreover, raising additional funds through the issuance of equity securities could cause existing stockholders to experience dilution and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Disruptions in the financial markets may have a significant adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and other adverse effects on us and our business. Our inability to obtain additional financing or refinancings on terms acceptable to us could delay or eliminate some or all of our growth plans, necessitate the sales of assets at unfavorable prices or both, and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nIncreases in market interest rates and/or the CPI could significantly increase the costs of our floating rate debt obligations, which could adversely affect our liquidity and earnings.\nOur floating rate debt obligations and any future indebtedness, if applicable, exposes us to interest rate and CPI risk. Therefore, any increase in prevailing interest rates or CPI could increase our future interest obligations, which could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nThe phasing out of LIBOR may increase the interest costs of our debt obligations, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow.\nThe interest rates for certain of our variable-rate debt obligations are calculated based on the LIBOR plus a spread. LIBOR is regulated by the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which has announced that it plans to phase-out LIBOR by the end of 2021 and other LIBOR tenors by June 30, 2023. These debt obligations may be extended or we may enter into new variable interest rate debt obligations based on LIBOR. To the extent that LIBOR is discontinued, the terms of such variable-rate debt agreements may provide that the lender will have the right to choose an alternative index based on comparable information. It is unclear whether LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will evolve by the applicable phase out dates, or whether alternative and comparable index rates will be established and adopted by our lenders and other financial institutions. To the extent LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change, interest rates on any such variable-rate debt obligations may increase, which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Operations and Strategy\nWe have incurred losses from operations in each of the last three fiscal years and may do so in the future.\nWe have incurred a net loss in each of fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018. We currently have limited resources and substantial debt obligations. Given our history of losses and the current industry conditions, it is not certain that we will be able to achieve and/or sustain profitability or positive cash flows from operations in the future, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to fund our operations and fulfill our debt obligations.\nWe largely rely on private pay residents and circumstances that adversely affect the ability of the seniors to pay for our services could have a material adverse effect on us.\nApproximately 93.6% of our total revenues from communities that we operated were attributable to private pay sources and approximately 6.4% of our revenues from these communities were attributable to reimbursements from Medicaid, in each case, during fiscal year 2020. We expect to continue to rely primarily on the ability of residents to pay for our services from their own or family financial resources. Unfavorable economic conditions in the housing, financial, and credit markets, inflation, or other circumstances that adversely affect the ability of seniors to pay for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nThe senior living services industry is very competitive and some competitors may have substantially greater financial resources than us.\nThe senior living services industry is highly competitive, and we expect that all segments of the industry will become increasingly competitive in the future. We compete with other companies providing independent living, assisted living, home health care and other similar services and care alternatives. We also compete with other health care businesses with respect to attracting and retaining nurses, technicians, aides and other high quality professional and non-professional employees and managers. Although we believe there is a need for senior housing communities in the markets where we operate residences, we expect that competition will increase from existing competitors and new market entrants, some of whom may have substantially greater financial resources than us. In addition, some of our competitors operate on a not-for-profit basis or as charitable organizations and have the ability to finance capital expenditures on a tax-exempt basis or through the receipt of charitable contributions, neither of which are available to us. Furthermore, if the development of new senior housing communities outpaces the demand for those communities in the markets in which we have senior housing communities, those markets may become saturated. Regulation in the independent and assisted living industry is not substantial. Consequently, development of new senior housing communities could outpace demand. An oversupply of those communities in our markets could cause us to experience decreased occupancy, reduced operating margins and lower profitability.\nTermination of resident agreements and resident attrition could affect adversely our revenues and earnings.\nState regulations governing assisted living facilities require written resident agreements with each resident. Most of these regulations also require that each resident have the right to terminate the resident agreement for any reason on reasonable notice. Consistent with these regulations, the resident agreements signed by us allow residents to terminate their lease upon 0 to 30 days\u2019 notice. Thus, we cannot contract with residents to stay for longer periods of time, unlike typical apartment leasing arrangements that involve lease agreements with specified leasing periods of up to a year or longer. Our resident agreements generally provide for termination of the lease upon death or allow a resident to terminate their lease upon the need for a higher level of care not provided at the community. In addition, the advanced age of our average resident means that the resident turnover rate in our senior living facilities may be difficult to predict. If a large number of residents elected to or otherwise terminate their resident agreements at or around the same time, then our revenues and earnings could be adversely affected.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2020. If we are unable to remediate this material weakness, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, we identified certain control deficiencies in the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting that constituted a material weakness. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over the financial reporting related to deficiencies in accounting for material non-recurring transactions. Specifically, our controls did not operate effectively to ensure certain account reconciliations and journal entries were reviewed at the appropriate level of precision. Control deficiencies could result in a misstatement of our accounts or disclosures that could result in a material misstatement of our financial results that would not be prevented or detected, and accordingly, we determined that these control deficiencies constitute a material weakness. We are working to remediate this material weakness through the development and implementation of processes and controls over the financial reporting process.\nWhile new controls are being designed and implemented, they have not operated for a sufficient period of time to demonstrate the material weakness has been remediated. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date will be sufficient to remediate the material weakness we identified or avoid the identification of additional material weaknesses in the future. Although we plan to complete this remediation, if the steps we take do not remediate the material weakness in a timely manner, there could continue to be a reasonable possibility that this control deficiency or others could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThere is an inherent risk of liability in the provision of personal and health care services, not all of which may be covered by insurance.\nThe provision of personal and health care services in the long-term care industry entails an inherent risk of liability. In recent years, participants in the long-term care industry have become subject to an increasing number of lawsuits alleging negligence or related legal theories, many of which involve large claims and result in the incurrence of significant defense costs. Moreover, senior housing communities offer residents a greater degree of independence in their daily living. This increased level of independence may subject the resident and, therefore, us to risks that would be reduced in more institutionalized settings. We currently maintain insurance in amounts we believe are comparable to those maintained by other senior living companies based on the nature of the risks, our historical experience and industry standards, and we believe that this insurance coverage is adequate. However, we may become subject to claims in excess of our insurance or claims not covered by our insurance, such as claims for punitive damages, terrorism and natural disasters. A claim against us not covered by, or in excess of, our insurance could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nIn addition, our insurance policies must be renewed annually. Based upon poor loss experience and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, insurers for the long-term care industry have become increasingly wary of liability exposure. A number of insurance carriers have stopped writing coverage to this market or reduced the level of coverage offered, and those remaining have increased premiums and deductibles substantially. The COVID-19 pandemic may also adversely affect our ability to obtain insurance coverage or increase the costs of doing so. Therefore, we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain liability insurance in the future or that, if that insurance is available, it will be available on acceptable economic terms.\nDamage from catastrophic weather and other natural events could result in losses and adversely affect certain of our residents.\nA certain number of our properties are located in areas that have experienced and may experience in the future catastrophic weather and other natural events from time to time, including snow or ice storms, windstorm, tornados, hurricanes, fires, earthquakes, flooding or other severe weather. These events could result in some of our communities losing electricity, gas, water and other utilities for a period of time, and could also result in increased electricity and other utility expenses. Damage to facilities or loss of power or water could adversely impact our residents and result in a decline in occupancy at our communities. We maintain insurance policies, including coverage for business interruption, designed to mitigate financial losses resulting from such adverse weather and natural events; however, there can be no assurance that adverse weather or natural events will not cause substantial damages or losses to our communities that could exceed our insurance coverage. In the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, such loss could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nDamage to facilities or loss of power or water could adversely impact our residents and result in a decline in occupancy at our communities.\nWe rely on information technology in our operations, and failure to maintain the security and functionality of our information technology and computer systems, or to prevent a cybersecurity attack, breach or other unauthorized access, could adversely affect our business, reputation and relationships with our residents, employees and referral sources and may subject us to remediation costs, government inquiries and liabilities under HIPAA and data and consumer protection laws, any of which could materially and adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nWe rely upon the proper function and availability of our information technology and computer systems, including hardware, software, applications and electronic data storage, to communicate with our residents and patients, their doctors and other healthcare providers, and our employees and vendors and to store, process, safeguard and transmit our business information, including proprietary business information, private health information and personally identifiable information of our residents and employees. We have taken steps and expended significant resources to\nprotect the cybersecurity and physical security of our information technology and computer systems and have developed and implemented policies and procedures to comply with HIPAA and other applicable privacy laws, rules and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that our security measures, policies and procedures and disaster recovery plans will prevent damage to, or interruption or breach of, our information systems or other unauthorized access to private information.\nThe cybersecurity risks to our Company and our third-party vendors are heightened by, among other things, the frequently changing techniques used to illegally or fraudulently obtain unauthorized access to systems, advances in computing technology and cryptography, and the possibility that unauthorized access may be difficult to detect, which could lead to us or our vendors being unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, components of our information systems that we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the security or functionality of our information systems. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business or communicate, through computer viruses, hacking, fraud or other forms of deceiving our employees or contractors such as email phishing attacks. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our cybersecurity or to investigate and remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities, attacks or incidents.\nIn addition, we rely on software support of third parties to secure and maintain our information systems and data. Our inability, or the inability of these third parties, to continue to maintain and upgrade our information systems could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. Costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations.\nFailure to maintain the security and functionality of our information systems, or to prevent a cybersecurity attack or other unauthorized access to our information systems, could expose us to a number of adverse consequences, including: (i) interruptions to our business and operations; (ii) the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive information, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our residents, patients and employees; (iii) significant remediation costs; (iv) negative publicity that could damage our reputation and our relationships with our residents, patients, employees and referral sources; (v) litigation and potential liability under privacy, security and consumer protection laws, including HIPAA, or other applicable laws, rules or regulations; and (vi) government inquiries that may result in sanctions and other criminal or civil fines or penalties. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely impact our revenues, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nBecause we do not presently have plans to pay dividends on our common stock, stockholders must look solely to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment.\nIt is the policy of our board of directors to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business. Accordingly, we have not and do not currently anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends on your common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, operations, capital requirements, financial condition, restrictions in then existing financing agreements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Accordingly, stockholders must look solely to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment. This appreciation may not occur.\nRisks Related to Human Capital\nWe rely on the services of key executive officers and the transition of management or loss of these officers or their services could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe depend on the services of our executive officers for our management. We have recently undergone changes in our senior management and may experience further changes in the future. The transition of management, loss of any of our executive officers or our inability to attract and retain qualified management personnel in the future, could affect our ability to manage our business and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nA significant increase in our labor costs could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe compete with other providers of senior living services with respect to attracting and retaining qualified management personnel responsible for the day-to-day operations of each of our communities and skilled personnel\nresponsible for providing resident care. We rely upon the quality of our staff as a means to differentiate our services from other providers. A shortage of nurses or trained personnel may require us to enhance our wage and benefits package in order to compete in the hiring and retention of these personnel or to hire more expensive temporary personnel. We also will be dependent on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. No assurance can be given that our labor costs will not increase, or that, if they do increase, they can be matched by corresponding increases in rates charged to residents. Any significant failure by us to control our labor costs or to pass on any increased labor costs to residents through rate increases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks related to the provision for employee health care benefits and future health care reform legislation.\nWe use a combination of insurance and self-insurance for employee health care plans. We record expenses under these plans based on estimates of the costs of expected claims, administrative costs and stop-loss premiums. These estimates are then adjusted to reflect actual costs incurred. Actual costs under these plans are subject to variability depending primarily upon participant enrollment and demographics, the actual costs of claims and whether stop-loss insurance covers these claims. In the event that our cost estimates differ from actual costs, we could incur additional unplanned health care costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d) expanded healthcare coverage to millions of previously uninsured people beginning in 2014 and has resulted in significant changes to the United States healthcare system. This comprehensive healthcare legislation has resulted and will continue to result in extensive rulemaking by regulatory authorities, and also may be altered, amended, repealed, or replaced. It is difficult to predict the full impact of the Affordable Care Act due to the complexity of the law and implementing regulations, as well our inability to foresee how participants in the healthcare industry will respond to the choices available to them under the law. The provisions of the legislation and other regulations implementing the provisions of the Affordable Care Act or any amended or replacement legislation may increase our costs, adversely affect our revenues, expose us to expanded liability, or require us to revise the ways in which we conduct our business.\nIn addition to its impact on the delivery and payment for healthcare, the Affordable Care Act and the implementing regulations have resulted and may continue to result in increases to our costs to provide healthcare benefits to our employees. We also may be required to make additional employee-related changes to our business as a result of provisions in the Affordable Care Act or any amended or replacement legislation impacting the provision of health insurance by employers, which could result in additional expense and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow.\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Compliance and/or Legal Matters\nWe are subject to governmental regulations and compliance, some of which are burdensome and some of which may change to our detriment in the future.\nFederal and state governments regulate various aspects of our business. The development and operation of senior housing communities and the provision of health care services are subject to federal, state and local licensure, certification and inspection laws that regulate, among other matters, the number of licensed beds, the provision of services, the distribution of pharmaceuticals, billing practices and policies, equipment, staffing (including professional licensing), operating policies and procedures, fire prevention measures, environmental matters, and compliance with building and safety codes. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in the denial of reimbursement, the imposition of fines, temporary suspension of admission of new residents, suspension or decertification from the Medicaid program, restrictions on the ability to acquire new communities or expand existing communities and, in extreme cases, the revocation of a community\u2019s license or closure of a community. We believe that such regulation will increase in the future and we are unable to predict the content of new regulations or their effect on our business, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nVarious states, including several of the states in which we currently operate, control the supply of licensed beds and assisted living communities through a CON requirement or other programs. In those states, approval is required for the addition of licensed beds and some capital expenditures at those communities. To the extent that a CON or other similar approval is required for the acquisition or construction of new communities, the expansion of the number of licensed beds, services, or existing communities, we could be adversely affected by our failure or inability to obtain that approval, changes in the standards applicable for that approval, and possible delays and expenses associated with\nobtaining that approval. In addition, in most states, the reduction of the number of licensed beds or the closure of a community requires the approval of the appropriate state regulatory agency and, if we were to seek to reduce the number of licensed beds at, or to close, a community, we could be adversely affected by a failure to obtain or a delay in obtaining that approval.\nFederal and state anti-remuneration laws, such as \u201canti-kickback\u201d laws, govern some financial arrangements among health care providers and others who may be in a position to refer or recommend patients to those providers. These laws prohibit, among other things, some direct and indirect payments that are intended to induce the referral of patients to, the arranging for services by, or the recommending of, a particular provider of health care items or services. Federal anti-kickback laws have been broadly interpreted to apply to some contractual relationships between health care providers and sources of patient referral. Similar state laws vary, are sometimes vague, and seldom have been interpreted by courts or regulatory agencies. Violation of these laws can result in loss of licensure, civil and criminal penalties, and exclusion of health care providers or suppliers from participation in the Medicaid program. There can be no assurance that those laws will be interpreted in a manner consistent with our practices.\nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, all places of public accommodation are required to meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. A number of additional federal, state and local laws exist that also may require modifications to existing and planned communities to create access to the properties by disabled persons. Although we believe that our communities are substantially in compliance with present requirements or are exempt therefrom, if required changes involve a greater expenditure than anticipated or must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, additional costs would be incurred by us. Further legislation may impose additional burdens or restrictions with respect to access by disabled persons, the costs of compliance with which could be substantial.\nHIPAA, in conjunction with the federal regulations promulgated thereunder by the Department of Health and Human Services, has established, among other requirements, standards governing the privacy of certain protected and individually identifiable health information that is created, received or maintained by a range of covered entities. HIPAA has also established standards governing uniform health care transactions, the codes and identifiers to be used by the covered entities and standards governing the security of certain electronic transactions conducted by covered entities. Penalties for violations can range from civil money penalties for errors and negligent acts to criminal fines and imprisonment for knowing and intentional misconduct. HIPAA is a complex set of regulations and many unanswered questions remain with respect to the manner in which HIPAA applies to businesses such as those operated by us.\nIn addition, some states have begun to enact more comprehensive privacy laws and regulations addressing consumer rights to data protection or transparency. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act became effective in 2020, and we expect additional federal and state legislative and regulatory efforts to regulate consumer privacy protection in the future. Compliance with such legislative and regulatory developments could be burdensome and costly, and the failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAn increasing number of legislative initiatives have been introduced or proposed in recent years that would result in major changes in the health care delivery system on a national or a state level. Among the proposals that have been introduced are price controls on hospitals, insurance market reforms to increase the availability of group health insurance to small businesses, requirements that all businesses offer health insurance coverage to their employees and the creation of government health insurance plans that would cover all citizens and increase payments by beneficiaries. We cannot predict whether any of the above proposals or other proposals will be adopted and, if adopted, no assurances can be given that their implementation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be subject to liability for environmental damages.\nUnder various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties in connection with the contamination. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants, and liability under these laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of the substances may be substantial, and the presence of the substances, or the failure to properly remediate the\nproperty, may adversely affect the owner\u2019s ability to sell or lease the property or to borrow using the property as collateral. In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of the substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not the facility is owned or operated by the person. Finally, the owner of a site may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from a site. If we become subject to any of these claims the costs involved could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Organization and Structure:\nAnti-takeover provisions in our governing documents, governing law and material agreements may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable or prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated by-laws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable or prevent the removal of our current board of directors and management. We have a number of anti-takeover devices in place that will hinder takeover attempts, including: a staggered board of directors consisting of three classes of directors, each of whom serve three-year terms; removal of directors only for cause, and only with the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the voting interest of stockholders entitled to vote; right of our directors to issue preferred stock from time to time with voting, economic and other rights superior to those of our common stock without the consent of our stockholders; provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws limiting the right of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; advance notice requirements for stockholders with respect to director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings; requirement for two-thirds stockholder approval for amendment of our by-laws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation; and no provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which means that the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock can elect all the directors standing for election.\nSeveral of our loan documents and other material agreements require approval in the event we undergo a change of control of our company. These provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the Company even if this change of control would benefit our stockholders.\nIn addition to the anti-takeover provisions described above, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Section 203 generally prohibits a person beneficially owning, directly or indirectly, 15% or more of our outstanding common stock from engaging in a business combination with us for three years after the person acquired the stock. However, this prohibition does not apply if (A) our directors approve in advance the person\u2019s ownership of 15% or more of the shares or the business combination or (B) the business combination is approved by our stockholders by a vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares not owned by the acquiring person.\nWe are a holding company with no operations and rely on our operating subsidiaries to provide us with funds necessary to meet our financial obligations.\nWe are a holding company with no material direct operations. Our principal assets are the equity interests we directly or indirectly hold in our operating subsidiaries. As a result, we are dependent on loans, distributions, and other payments from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations. Our subsidiaries are legally distinct from us and have no obligation to make funds available to us.\nRisks Related to Other Market Factors\nIf we cannot regain compliance with the continued listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d), the NYSE will delist our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NYSE. In April 2020, we received notice (the \u201cNotice\u201d) from the NYSE that we were no longer in compliance with NYSE continued listing standards set forth in Section 802.01B (the \u201cMinimum Market Capitalization Standard\u201d) and Section 802.01C (the \u201cMinimum Stock Price Standard\u201d) of the NYSE\u2019s Listed Company Manual due to the fact that (i) our average global market capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period was less than $50 million and, at the same time, our stockholders\u2019 equity was less than $50 million, and (ii) the average closing price of our common stock was less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.\nIn December 2020, we implemented a Reverse Stock Split in order to increase the market price per share of our common stock and regain compliance with the Minimum Stock Price Standard. However, if we are unable to regain compliance with the Minimum Market Capitalization Standard within the time periods prescribed by the NYSE\u2019s rules, our common stock will be delisted. Due to recent market conditions, the NYSE temporarily extended the applicable cure periods for complying with the Minimum Market Capitalization Standard, through and including June 30, 2020, and as such, the NYSE previously informed us that it had until December 19, 2021 to regain compliance with the Minimum Market Capitalization Statement.\nIn accordance with the NYSE\u2019s listing requirements, we submitted our plan to the NYSE advising the NYSE of definitive action we have taken, or are taking, to bring us into conformity with the Minimum Market Capitalization Standard within 18 months after our receipt of the Notice. The NYSE accepted our plan in July 2020, and as a result, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE during the cure period, subject to our compliance with the plan and other continued listing standards. The NYSE will review us on a quarterly basis to confirm compliance with the plan. If we fail to comply with the plan or does not meet continued listing standards at the end of the 18-month cure period, we will be subject to the prompt initiation of NYSE suspension and delisting procedures.\nA delisting of our common stock could negatively impact us by, among other things:\n\u2022\nreducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock;\n\u2022\nreducing the number of investors, including institutional investors, willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity;\n\u2022\ndecreasing the amount of news and analyst coverage relating to us;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to issue additional securities, obtain additional financing or pursue strategic restructuring, refinancing or other transactions; and\n\u2022\nimpacting our reputation and, as a consequence, our ability to attract new business.\nFuture offerings of equity securities by us may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by offering additional equity securities. Additional equity offerings may dilute the economic and voting rights of our existing stockholders and/or reduce the market price of our common stock. Our decision to issue equity securities in a future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their holdings in our Company.\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially over the past several years and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future.\nOur stock price has been, and may continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors, which are described throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those factors discussed under this section entitled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d Some of these factors are beyond our control. We may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders or securities analysts at some point in the future, and our stock price could decline as a result. This volatility may prevent you from being able to sell your common stock at or above the price you paid for your common stock.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility recently that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nActions of activist stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, and the market price of our common stock.\nWe value constructive input from our stockholders and engage in dialogue with our stockholders regarding our governance practices, strategy, and performance. However, activist stockholders may disagree with the composition of\nour board of directors or management, our strategy, or capital allocation decisions and may seek to effect change through various strategies that range from private engagement to public campaigns, proxy contests, efforts to force proposals, or transactions not supported by our board of directors and litigation. Responding to these actions may be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, divert the attention of our board of directors, management, and our associates and interfere with our ability to pursue our strategy and to attract and retain qualified board and executive leadership. The perceived uncertainty as to our future direction that may result from actions of activist stockholders may also negatively impact our ability to attract and retain residents at our communities. We cannot provide assurance that constructive engagement with our stockholders will be successful. Any such stockholder activism may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and cash flow and the market price of our common stock.\nVarious factors, including general economic conditions, could adversely affect our financial performance and other aspects of our business.\nGeneral economic conditions, such as inflation, the consumer price index, commodity costs, fuel and other energy costs, costs of salaries, wages, benefits and insurance, interest rates, and tax rates, affect our facility operating, facility lease, general and administrative and other expenses, and we have no control or limited ability to control such factors. Current global economic conditions and uncertainties, the potential for failures or realignments of financial institutions, and the related impact on available credit may affect us and our business partners, landlords, counterparties, and residents or prospective residents in an adverse manner including, but not limited to, reducing access to liquid funds or credit, increasing the cost of credit, limiting our ability to manage interest rate risk, increasing the risk that certain of our business partners, landlords or counterparties would be unable to fulfill their obligations to us, and other impacts which we are unable to fully anticipate.", "PERMNO": 85419, "SIC": 8300, "TIC": "CSU"}
