{"cik": "1702750", "company": "BYLINE BANCORP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-07", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below. You should carefully consider these risks, together with all of the information included herein. Any of the following risks, as well as risks that we do not know or currently deem immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nCredit and Interest Rate Risks\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully manage credit risk.\nThe operation of our business requires us to manage credit risk. As a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers will be unable to repay their loans and leases according to their terms, and that the collateral securing repayment of their loans or leases, if any, may not be sufficient to ensure repayment. In addition, there are risks inherent in making any loan or lease, including risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan or lease may be repaid, risks relating to proper loan or lease underwriting, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, including the risk that a borrower may not provide information to us about its business in a timely manner, and/or may present inaccurate or incomplete information to us, and risks relating to the value of collateral. In order to manage credit risk successfully, we must, among other things, maintain disciplined and prudent underwriting standards. The weakening of these standards for any reason, a lack of discipline or diligence in underwriting and monitoring loans and leases, the inability to adequately adapt policies and procedures to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting borrowers and the quality of our loan and lease portfolio, may result in defaults, foreclosures and additional charge-offs and may necessitate that we significantly increase our allowance for loan and lease losses, each of which could adversely affect our net income. As a result, our inability to successfully manage credit risk could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe may underestimate the credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio and have credit losses in excess of the amount we provide for loan and lease losses.\nThe credit quality of our loan and lease portfolio can have a significant impact on our earnings. We maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses, which is a reserve established through a provision charged to expense representing management\u2019s estimate of probable losses that may be incurred within our existing portfolio of loans and leases. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to reserve for probable incurred losses and risks inherent in our loan and lease portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects\nmanagement\u2019s continuing evaluation of specific credit risks; the quality of the portfolio; the value of the underlying collateral; the level of non-accruing loans and leases; incurred losses inherent in the current portfolio; and economic, political, and regulatory conditions. Our allowance methodology includes the use of both actual historical loss data on loans made by Byline Bank as well as industry and peer data, which could increase the subjectivity of the calculation. This process, which is critical to our financial results and condition, requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d) for business combination accounting, the loans acquired through our recapitalization and our subsequent bank acquisitions were recorded at their estimated fair value. Therefore, there was no allowance for loan losses associated with those loans at acquisition. Management continues to evaluate the allowance needed on the acquired loans, which includes considering the remaining net acquisition accounting adjustment ($4.8 million at December 31, 2021).\nAlthough we believe our allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate to absorb probable and reasonably estimable losses in our loan and lease portfolio, it may not be sufficient. We could sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the amount of our allowance as a result of a variety of reasons, such as changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information and other factors within and outside our control. If real estate values were to decline or if economic conditions in our markets were to deteriorate unexpectedly, additional losses not incorporated in the existing allowance might occur. Losses in excess of the existing allowance will reduce our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. A severe downturn in the economy generally, in our markets specifically, or affecting the business and assets of individual customers, would generate increased charge-offs and a need for higher provision for loan and lease losses.\nWe may also be required to take additional provisions for loan and lease losses in the future to further supplement the allowance due to requirements by our banking regulators. Bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance, the policies and procedures we use to determine the level of the allowance and the value attributed to non-performing loans or to real estate acquired through foreclosure. Such regulatory agencies may require us to make further provisions or recognize future charge-offs. Further, charge-offs in future periods that exceed the allowance would require an to increase the allowance.\nAny increases in our provision for loan and lease losses will result in a decrease in net income and may reduce retained earnings and capital and, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe FASB has recently issued an accounting standard update that will result in a significant change in how we recognize credit losses and may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) issued an accounting standard update, \u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\u201d that will replace the current approach under GAAP for establishing allowances for loan and lease losses, which generally considers only past events and current conditions, with a forward-looking methodology referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d). See Note 2 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for additional information about the standard.\nWe also expect to incur transition and ongoing costs in developing and implementing the CECL methodology. We cannot yet determine the magnitude of any such one-time cumulative adjustment or of the overall impact of the new standard on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business is subject to interest rate risk and fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings.\nFluctuations in interest rates may negatively affect our business and may weaken demand for some of our products. Our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on interest-earning assets, such as investment securities, loans, and leases, the interest expense that we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Additionally, changes in interest rates also affect the premiums we may receive in connection with the sale of U.S. government guaranteed loans in the secondary market, pre-payment speeds of loans for which we own servicing rights, our ability to fund our operations with customer deposits, and the fair value of securities in our investment portfolio. Therefore, any change in general market interest rates can have a significant effect on our net interest income and results of operations.\nWe seek to mitigate our interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swaps and other interest rate derivative contracts from time to time with counterparties. Our hedging strategies rely on assumptions and projections regarding interest rates, asset levels, and general market factors and subject us to counterparty risk. There is no assurance that our interest rate mitigation strategies will be successful, and if our assumptions and projections prove to be incorrect or our hedging strategies do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, we may incur losses that could adversely affect our earnings.\nOur interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on some types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate prior to changes in broader market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag. The result of these changes to rates may cause differing spreads on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Although we take measures intended to manage the risks from changes in market interest rates, we cannot control or accurately predict changes in market rates of interest or be sure our protective measures are adequate.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $2.2 billion of non-interest-bearing demand deposits and $572.4 million of interest-bearing checking accounts. Current interest rates for interest-bearing accounts are low due to current market conditions. If a low interest rate environment persists, we may be unable to increase our net interest income. However, we do not know what market rates will eventually\nbe, especially if the FRB increases interest rates as is currently anticipated. To the extent we offer higher interest rates on checking accounts to maintain current customers or attract new customers, our interest expense will increase, perhaps materially. Furthermore, if we fail to offer interest in a sufficient amount to keep these demand deposits, our core deposits may be reduced, which would require us to obtain funding in other ways or risk slowing our future asset growth.\nWe may be adversely impacted by the transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a reference rate.\nOn March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority and the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration announced that the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR (\u201cUSD LIBOR\u201d) settings would cease to be published immediately after December 31, 2021. The publication of overnight and one-, three-, six-, and 12-month USD LIBOR settings would be extended through June 30, 2023 to provide additional time for market participants to wind down or modify existing contracts that reference these LIBOR tenors.\nIn response, the FDIC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the OCC issued joint guidance directing banks and market participants to cease entering new LIBOR contracts after December 31, 2021,which we have done. Although most LIBOR tenors will continue to be published through June 30, 2023 to aid in the transition of legacy LIBOR contracts (e.g. maturity), as of January 1, 2021, we no longer originate loans indexed to LIBOR nor enter into modifications which create new LIBOR exposure.\nDuring 2021, we began a transition to using a forward-looking term rate based upon the Secured the Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"), CME Term SOFR (\u201cTerm SOFR\u201d) as the replacement benchmark index in lieu of LIBOR. SOFR is the Alternative Reference Rates Committee\u2019s recommended alternative to USD LIBOR. Because the Term SOFR market continues to develop and deepen, changes in SOFR or Term SOFR or changes in market perceptions of the acceptability of Term SOFR as a benchmark could result in changes to our risk exposures (for example, because SOFR is a broad measurement of the cost borrowing cash secured by U.S. Treasury securities, changes or disruptions in the repo market may adversely affect the availability or cost of floating-rate funding and, therefore, our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates) or otherwise result in losses on a product or having to pay more or receive less on financial instruments that we own or have issued.\nUncertainty as to the nature of other alternative reference rates (i.e. the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index, Ameribor) and their broader acceptance by the market may also adversely affect SOFR rates and the value of SOFR-based loans, and to a lesser extent securities in our portfolio, and may impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and borrowings, including the rates we pay on our subordinated debentures and trust preferred securities.\nSuch uncertainty may result in pricing volatility and increased capital requirements, accounting impacts, compliance, basis risk, legal and operational costs and risks associated with customer disclosures, discretionary actions taken or negotiation of loan modifications to move from LIBOR to Term SOFR prior to the June 30, 2023 cessation, reduced loan balances if borrowers do not accept the substitute indices we are able provide, systems disruption, business continuity, or model disruption. Finally, if we or other market participants fail to properly plan to implement alternative rates other than LIBOR, it could have an adverse effect on us and the financial system as a whole.\nOur business, profitability, and liquidity may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or defaults by, third parties who owe us money, securities or other assets or whose securities, or obligations we hold.\nIn addition to relying on borrowers to repay their loans and leases, we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money, securities, or other assets will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure, or other reasons. A default by a significant market participant, or concerns that such a party may default, could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses, or defaults by other parties, which in turn could adversely affect us.\nWe are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances. Deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold, including the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Government National Mortgage Association and municipalities, could result in significant losses.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, and in evaluating and monitoring our loan and lease portfolio on an ongoing basis, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports, and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of those customers or counterparties or of other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate, incomplete, fraudulent, or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other financial or business information, or the failure to receive such information on a timely basis, could result in loan or lease losses, reputational damage or other effects that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe value of the financial instruments we own may decline in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we owned $1.5 billion of investment securities, which consisted primarily of our positions in U.S. government and government-sponsored enterprises and federal agency obligations, mortgage and asset-backed securities and municipal\nsecurities. We evaluate our investment securities on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic and market conditions warrant such an evaluation, to determine whether any decline in fair value below amortized cost is the result of an other-than-temporary impairment. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires complex, subjective judgments in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. We may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairment in future periods, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, an increase in market interest rates may affect the market value of our securities portfolio, potentially reducing accumulated other comprehensive income and/or earnings.\nFunding Risks\nA lack of liquidity could affect operations and jeopardize our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLiquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our obligations, including financial commitments, as they come due and is inherent in our operations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and/or investment securities, and from other sources could have a material negative effect on our liquidity. Our most important source of funds consists of our customer deposits. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, we could lose a relatively low cost source of funds. This loss would require us to seek other funding alternatives in order to continue to grow, thereby increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income.\nOther primary sources of funds consist of cash from operations and investment maturities, redemptions, and sales, as well as borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, the FHLB and other third-party lenders from time to time. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to continue to implement our business plan, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur liquidity is dependent on dividends from Byline Bank.\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from Byline Bank, our wholly-owned banking subsidiary. A substantial portion of our cash flow from operating activities, comes primarily from dividends we receive from Byline Bank. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the bank may pay to us. As of December 31, 2021, Byline Bank had the capacity to pay Byline Bancorp dividends of up to $161.7 million without the need to obtain prior regulatory approval. Also, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. In the event Byline Bank is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service our existing debt or any debt we may incur, pay obligations or pay dividends on our common and preferred stock, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and such capital may not be available when needed or at all.\nWe may need to raise additional capital, in the form of debt or equity securities, in the future to have sufficient capital resources to meet our commitments and fund our business and future growth, particularly if the quality of our assets or earnings were to deteriorate significantly. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and our financial condition. Further, if we need to raise capital in the future, we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would then have to compete with those institutions for investors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOperational Risks\nWe may not be able to implement our growth strategy or manage costs effectively, resulting in lower earnings or profitability.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to grow and to be profitable in future periods, or, if profitable, that our overall earnings will remain consistent or increase in the future. Our strategy focuses on organic growth, supplemented by opportunistic acquisitions.\nOur growth requires that we increase our loan and deposit growth while managing risks by following prudent loan underwriting standards without increasing interest rate risk or compressing our net interest margin, maintaining more than adequate capital at all times, hiring and retaining qualified employees, and successfully implementing strategic projects and initiatives. Even if we are able to increase our interest income, our earnings may nonetheless be reduced by increased expenses, such as additional employee compensation or other general and administrative expenses and increased interest expense on any liabilities incurred or deposits solicited to fund\nincreases in assets. Additionally, if our competitors extend credit on terms we find to pose excessive risks, or at interest rates which we believe do not warrant the credit exposure, we may not be able to maintain our lending volume and could experience deteriorating financial performance. Our inability to manage our growth successfully or to continue to expand into new markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nNew lines of business, products, product enhancements or services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and product enhancements as well as new services within our existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances in which the markets are not fully developed. In implementing, developing, or marketing new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services, we may invest significant time and resources and not realize their expected results or returns. Further, initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also affect the ultimate implementation of a new line of business or offerings of new products, product enhancements or services. Furthermore, any new line of business, product, product enhancement or service or system conversion could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or offerings of new products, product enhancements or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nExternal Risks\nOur business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.\nOur financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of our borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and leases and the value of collateral securing those loans and leases, as well as demand for loans and leases and other products and services we offer, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets in which we operate and in the United States as a whole. Unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in the Chicago metropolitan area. The economic conditions in this local market may be different from, or worse than, the economic conditions in the United States as a whole. Some elements of the business environment that affect our financial performance include short-term and long-term interest rates, the prevailing yield curve, inflation and price levels, tax policy, monetary policy, unemployment, and the strength of the domestic economy and the local economy in the markets in which we operate. Also, the occurrence of other external events, such as geopolitical events and widespread public health emergencies or pandemics may negatively affect the business environment in our markets. Unfavorable market conditions can result in a deterioration in the credit quality of our borrowers and the demand for our products and services, an increase in the number of loan and lease delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs, additional provisions for loan and lease losses and an overall material adverse effect on the quality of our loan and lease portfolio. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by, among other factors, declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; changes in inflation or interest rates; increases in real estate and other state and local taxes; high unemployment; natural disasters; geopolitical issues and uncertainty; public health concerns; and other external factors or a combination of these or other factors.\nThe City of Chicago and State of Illinois currently face significant financial difficulties, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe have significant loan exposure in the Chicago metropolitan area, and both the City of Chicago and the State of Illinois currently face significant fiscal challenges, including large budget deficits, substantial unfunded pension obligations and low credit ratings compared to other local entities, which could negatively impact us to the extent this leads to declines in business activity and overall economic conditions in Illinois and the Chicago metropolitan area. These fiscal challenges may also lead to significant increases in real estate taxes on properties in the Chicago metropolitan area, which could negatively affect certain of our borrowers\u2019 ability to make payments on our loans.\nSome of our commercial loan borrowers are not-for-profit entities that may be dependent on the receipt of contractual payments and reimbursements from the State of Illinois for services rendered. To the extent the City of Chicago or State of Illinois, as applicable, delays or suspends these payments and reimbursements, this could adversely affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan repayment obligations to us. Any resulting delinquencies and defaults on these loans would in turn adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is significantly dependent on the real estate markets in which we operate, as a significant percentage of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate.\nMany of the loans in our portfolio are secured by real estate. As of December 31, 2021, our real estate loans held for investment include $324.2 million of construction and development loans, $252.9 million of multifamily loans, $637.1 million of non-owner CRE loans and $227.6 million of residential mortgage loans, with the majority of these real estate loans concentrated in the City of Chicago\nand the State of Illinois. Real property values in our market may differ from real property values in other markets and may be affected by a variety of factors outside of our control and the control of our borrowers, including national and local economic conditions, generally. The Chicago metropolitan area has experienced volatility in real estate values over the past decade. Declines in real estate values, including prices for homes and commercial properties in the Chicago metropolitan area, could result in a deterioration of the credit quality of our borrowers, an increase in the number of loan delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs, and reduced demand for our products and services, generally. In addition, our appraisal of the property may change significantly in relatively short periods of time and may not accurately describe the fair value of the real property collateral after the loan is made, resulting in loss if we foreclose on the property prior to realizing the full amount of any remaining indebtedness. Our CRE loans may have a greater risk of loss than residential mortgage loans, in part because these loans are generally larger or more complex to underwrite. In particular, real estate construction and acquisition and development loans have certain risks not present in other types of loans, including risks associated with construction cost overruns, project completion risk, general contractor credit risk and risks associated with the ultimate sale or use of the completed construction. In addition, declines in real property values could reduce the value of any collateral we realize following a default on these loans. An increase in the level of non-performing assets increases our risk profile and may affect the capital levels regulators believe are appropriate in light of the ensuing risk profile. In addition, we rely on appraisals and other valuation techniques to establish the value of our other real estate owned (\u201cOREO\u201d) and personal property that we acquire through foreclosure proceedings and to determine certain loan impairments. If any of these valuations are inaccurate, our consolidated financial statements may not reflect the correct value of our OREO, and our allowance for loan and lease losses may not reflect accurate loan impairments. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our failure to effectively mitigate these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nTechnology Risks\nWe depend on information technology and telecommunications systems of third parties, and any systems failures, interruptions, or data breaches involving these systems could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems, third-party servicers, accounting systems, mobile and online banking platforms and financial intermediaries. We outsource to third parties many of our major systems, such as data processing, loan servicing, deposit processing, and internal audit systems. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to operate effectively or service our customers, resulting in potential noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations, loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, failure of third parties to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or fraud or misconduct on the part of employees of any of these third parties, could disrupt our operations or adversely affect our reputation.\nIt may be difficult for us to replace some of our third-party vendors, particularly vendors providing our core banking, debit card services, and information services, in a timely manner if they are unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in the future for any reason, and even if we are able to replace them, it may be at higher cost or result in the loss of customers. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches or failures of our information security controls or cybersecurity-related incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nAs a financial institution, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches, and cybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against us, our customer, or third-party service providers that we utilize, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our customers, disclosure or misuse of our information or our customer information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our customers, litigation, or damage to our reputation. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to systems used by us or our customers, denial or degradation of service attacks, and malware or other cyber-attacks. There continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches, and cyber-attacks directed at the financial services industry. Consistent with industry trends, we have also experienced an increase in attempted electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches, and cybersecurity-related incidents. Information pertaining to us and our customers is maintained, and transactions are executed, on networks and systems maintained by us and certain third-party partners, such as our online banking or reporting systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as execution of transactions over these systems, are essential to protect us and our customers against fraud and security breaches and to maintain our customers\u2019 confidence and privacy. Although we have developed, and continue to invest in, systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks and periodically test our security, our or our third-party partners\u2019 inability to anticipate, or failure to adequately mitigate, breaches of security could result in: losses to us or our customers; our loss of business and/or customers; damage to our reputation; the incurrence of additional expenses; disruption to our business; our inability to\ngrow our online services or other businesses; additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties; or our exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability-any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe continually encounter technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new, technology-driven products and services. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than we do. We may not be able to effectively implement new, technology-driven products and services, or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. In addition, the implementation of technological changes and upgrades to maintain current systems and integrate new ones may also cause service interruptions, transaction processing errors, and system conversion delays, and may cause us to fail to comply with applicable laws. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry and failure to avoid interruptions, errors, and delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nGuaranteed Loans Risks\nSmall Business Administration lending and other government guaranteed lending is an important part of our business. Our government guaranteed lending programs are dependent upon the U.S. federal government, and we face specific risks associated with originating SBA and other government guaranteed loans.\nOur SBA lending program is dependent upon the U.S. federal government. As an approved participant in the SBA Preferred Lender\u2019s Program (an \u201cSBA Preferred Lender\u201d), we enable our customers to obtain SBA loans without being subject to the potentially lengthy SBA approval process necessary for lenders that are not SBA Preferred Lenders. The SBA periodically reviews the lending operations of participating lenders to assess, among other things, whether the lender exhibits prudent risk management. When weaknesses are identified, the SBA may request corrective actions or impose enforcement actions, including revocation of the lender\u2019s SBA Preferred Lender status. If we lose our status as an SBA Preferred Lender, we may lose some or all of our customers to lenders who are SBA Preferred Lenders, and as a result we could experience a material adverse effect to our financial results. Any changes to the SBA program, changes to program-specific rules impacting volume eligibility under the guaranty program, as well as changes to the program amounts authorized by Congress, may also have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, any default by the U.S. government on its obligations or any prolonged government shutdown could impede our ability to originate SBA loans or other government guaranteed loans or sell such loans in the secondary market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nGenerally, we sell the guaranteed portion of our SBA 7(a) loans in the secondary market. These sales result in premium income for us at the time of sale and create a stream of future servicing income, as we retain the servicing rights to these loans. For the reasons described above, we may not be able to continue originating these loans or sell them in the secondary market. Furthermore, even if we are able to continue to originate and sell SBA 7(a) loans in the secondary market, we might not continue to realize premiums upon the sale of the guaranteed portion of these loans, or the premiums may decline due to economic and competitive factors. When we originate SBA loans, we incur credit risk on the non-guaranteed portion of the loans, and if a customer defaults on a loan, we share any loss and recovery related to the loan pro-rata with the SBA. If the SBA establishes that a loss on an SBA guaranteed loan is attributable to significant technical deficiencies in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by us, the SBA may seek recovery of the principal loss related to the deficiency from us. Generally, we do not maintain reserves or loss allowances for such potential claims and any such claims could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe laws, regulations and standard operating procedures that are applicable to government guaranteed loan products may change in the future. We cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business and profitability. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies and especially our organization, changes in the laws, regulations and procedures applicable to government guaranteed loans could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably.\nThe recognition of gains on the sale of loans and servicing asset valuations reflect certain assumptions.\nWe continue to expect that gains on the sale of U.S. government guaranteed loans will continue to comprise a significant component of our revenue. The gain on such sales recognized for year ended December 31, 2021 was $46.3 million. The determination of these gains is based on assumptions regarding the value of unguaranteed loans retained, servicing rights retained and deferred fees and costs, and net premiums paid by purchasers of the guaranteed portions of U.S. government guaranteed loans. The value of retained unguaranteed loans and servicing rights are determined based on market-derived factors such as prepayment rates, current market conditions and recent loan sales. Deferred fees and costs are determined using internal analysis of the cost to originate loans. Significant errors in assumptions used to compute gains on sale of loans or servicing asset valuations could result in material revenue misstatements, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and profitability. In addition, while we believe these\nvaluations reflect fair value and such valuations are subject to validation by an independent third-party, if such valuations are not reflective of fair market value then our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nLegal, Accounting, and Compliance Risks\nOur accounting estimates and risk management processes and controls rely on analytical and forecasting techniques and models and assumptions, which may not accurately predict future events.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to the manner in which we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with GAAP and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet which may result in our reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nCertain accounting policies and estimates are critical to presenting our financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. These critical accounting policies and estimates include (i) acquisition-related fair value computations, (ii) the carrying value of loans and leases, (iii) determining the provision and allowance for loan and lease losses, (iv) the valuation of intangible assets such as goodwill, servicing assets, core deposit intangibles, and customer relationship intangible (v) the determination of fair value for financial instruments, including other-than-temporary impairment losses, (vi) the valuation of real estate held for sale, and (vii) the valuation of or recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities. See Note 1 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report for further information. Because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters, we may be required to do one or more of the following: significantly increase the allowance for loan and lease losses or sustain loan and lease losses that are significantly higher than the reserve provided; reduce the carrying value of an asset measured at fair value; or significantly increase our accrued tax liability. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d.\nOur internal controls, disclosure controls, processes and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures are based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable (not absolute) assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Furthermore, we currently outsource our internal audit function. Any failure or circumvention of our controls, processes and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls, processes and procedures could necessitate changes in those controls, processes and procedures, which may increase our compliance costs, divert management attention from our business or subject us to regulatory actions and increased regulatory scrutiny. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur goodwill may become impaired, which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition and may limit Byline Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us, thereby causing liquidity issues.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had goodwill of $148.4 million, or 17.7% of our total stockholders\u2019 equity. The excess purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets from acquisitions, or goodwill, is evaluated for impairment at least annually and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment has occurred. In testing for impairment, we conduct a qualitative assessment and we also estimate the fair value of net assets based on analyses of our market value, discounted cash flows and peer values. Consequently, the determination of the fair value of goodwill is sensitive to market-based economics and other key assumptions. Variability in market conditions or in key assumptions could result in impairment of goodwill, which is recorded as a non-cash adjustment to income. An impairment of goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe accounting for loans acquired in connection with our recapitalization and acquisitions is based on numerous subjective determinations that may prove to be inaccurate and have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nAll loans acquired as part of our recapitalization in 2013 as well as loans acquired in connection with our subsequent acquisitions have been recorded at their estimated fair value on their acquisition date without a carryover of the related allowance for loan losses. The determination of estimated fair value of acquired loans requires management to make subjective determinations regarding discount rate, estimates of losses on defaults, market conditions and other factors that are highly subjective in nature. A risk exists that our estimate of the fair value of acquired loans will prove to be inaccurate and that we ultimately will not recover the amount at which we recorded such loans on our balance sheet, which would require us to recognize losses.\nLoans acquired that have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at the date of acquisition that we will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments are accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 310-30, Accounting for Purchased Loans with Deteriorated Credit Quality. These credit-impaired loans,\nlike non-credit-impaired loans acquired, have been recorded at estimated fair value on their acquisition date, based on subjective determinations regarding risk ratings, expected future cash flows and fair value of the underlying collateral, without a carryover of the related allowance for loan and lease losses. We evaluate these loans quarterly to assess expected cash flows. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges or a reclassification of the difference from non-accretable to accretable yield with a positive impact on interest income prospectively. Because the accounting for these loans is based on subjective measures that can change frequently, we may experience fluctuations in our net interest income and provisions for loan losses attributable to these loans. These fluctuations could negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on future cash flows and taxable income.\nWe recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will be realized. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets, reducing the value of such assets. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted income from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. Our acquisitions and risk profile are key components used in the determination of our ability to realize the expected future benefit of our deferred tax assets. To the extent that future taxable income differs significantly from estimates as a result of the interest rate environment and loan and lease growth capabilities or other factors, our ability to realize the net deferred tax assets could be affected.\nWe are an emerging growth company and have decided to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting and other requirements applicable to emerging growth companies.\nFor as long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (\u201cJOBS\u201d) Act, we will have the option to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting and other requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d), being permitted to have an extended transition period for adopting any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the FASB or the SEC, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our registration statements, periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We have elected to, and expect to continue to, take advantage of certain of these and other exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, which is December 31, 2022.\nBecause we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards for an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with these accounting standards as of the public company effective dates.\nWe have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with these accounting standards as of the public company effective dates. Because our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates, investors may have difficulty evaluating or comparing our business, performance or prospects in comparison to other public companies, which may have a negative impact on the value and liquidity of our common stock.\nCertain activities are restricted due to commitments entered into with the FRB by us and our foreign national stockholders.\nWe have certain stockholders who invested in our recapitalization who are foreign nationals, and we and these foreign national stockholders have entered into commitments with the FRB that restrict some of our activities. In particular, without approval of the FRB, we are restricted from engaging in certain transactions with these foreign national stockholders, their immediate families, and any company controlled by such foreign national stockholders or by their immediate families. If we were to fail to comply with any of these restrictions, we could be subject to enforcement and other legal actions by the FRB, including civil and criminal penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the FRB could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the FRB. An important function of the FRB is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the FRB to implement these objectives are open market purchases and sales of U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate, and\nchanges in banks\u2019 reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments, and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the FRB have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition, and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe CRA requires our bank, consistent with safe and sound operations, to ascertain and meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income areas. Our bank\u2019s failure to comply with the CRA could, among other things, result in the denial or delay of certain corporate applications filed by us or our bank, including applications for branch openings or relocations and applications to acquire, merge or consolidate with another banking institution or holding company. In addition, the ECOA, the Fair Housing Act, and other fair lending laws and regulations prohibit discriminatory lending practices by financial institutions. A challenge to an institution\u2019s compliance with fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion, and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nLitigation and regulatory actions, including possible enforcement actions, could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, or other requirements resulting in increased expenses or restrictions on our business activities.\nOur business is subject to increased litigation and regulatory risks as a result of a number of factors, including the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry and the focus of state and federal prosecutors on banks and the financial services industry generally. In the normal course of business, we have in the past and may in the future be named as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions, and other litigation, arising in connection with our current and/or prior business activities. Legal actions could include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages, resulting in increased expenses, diminished income, damage to our reputation, and divert management attention from the operation of our business. In addition, while the arbitration provisions in certain of our customer agreements historically have limited our exposure to consumer class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future. Further, we have in the past and may in the future be subject to consent orders with our regulators.\nWe may also, from time to time, be the subject of subpoenas, requests for information, reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental agencies regarding our current and/or prior business activities. Further, any settlement, consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government agencies may result in litigation, investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government agencies begin independent reviews of the same activities. As a result, the outcome of legal and regulatory actions could be material to our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions against us.\nThe USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the Bank Secrecy Act require financial institutions to design and implement programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Federal and state bank regulators also have focused on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, these policies and procedures may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRegulations relating to privacy, information security, and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information, and adversely affect our business opportunities.\nWe are subject to various privacy, information security, and data protection laws, including requirements concerning security breach notification, and we could be negatively affected by these laws. For example, our business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley\nAct which, among other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on our ability to share nonpublic personal information about our customers with nonaffiliated third parties; (ii) requires that we provide certain disclosures to customers about our information collection, sharing and security practices, and (iii) requires that we develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program. Various state and federal banking regulators and states have also enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Moreover, legislators and regulators in the United States are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact on our privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer or employee information, and some of our current or planned business activities. This could also increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives.\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection, and information security laws to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory or governmental investigations or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Acquisition Activity\nWe may be adversely affected by risks associated with completed and potential acquisitions, including execution risks, failure to realize anticipated transaction benefits, and failure to overcome integration risks, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nWe have continued to grow our business both organically and through the acquisition of smaller banks that management believes strategically fit within our franchise and that we believe support our businesses and make financial and strategic sense. In the event that we continue to pursue further acquisitions, we may have difficulty executing on and may not realize the anticipated benefits of any transaction we complete. Any of the foregoing matters could materially and adversely affect us.\nGenerally, any acquisition of target financial institutions, branches, or other banking assets by us will require approval by, and cooperation from, a number of governmental regulatory agencies, possibly including the FRB and the FDIC as well as the IDFPR. Such regulators could deny our application, which would restrict our growth, or the regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to us.\nAs to any acquisition that we complete, we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated transaction benefits if the integration process takes longer or is more costly than expected or otherwise fails to meet our expectations. Depending on the condition of any institution or assets or liabilities that we may acquire, that acquisition may, at least in the near term, adversely affect our capital and earnings and, if not successfully integrated with our organization, may continue to have such effects over a longer period. Also, acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Our inability to overcome these risks could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, return on equity, return on assets, and our ability to implement our business strategy and enhance stockholder value, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected and continues to affect us, our business, employees, customers, counterparties and third-party service providers, and the ultimate extent of the impacts on our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity and prospects is uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created significant economic and financial disruption in the United States and globally. While the scope, duration and full effects of the pandemic are still not fully known, the pandemic and its associated impacts have had, are currently having and may for some time continue to have a destabilizing and negative effect on the U.S. and global economies, as well as financial and capital markets. The pandemic has impacted interest rates, increased economic and market uncertainty, disrupted trade and supply chains, increased unemployment levels, decreased consumer confidence generally and has generally caused significant disruption in global, national and local economic and business activity.\nThe ultimate extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business, cash flows, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, customer confidence, profitability and growth prospects will depend on continuing and future developments related to the virus, which are highly uncertain, cannot be predicted and are outside of our control. These future developments may include the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of new variants of COVID-19, the possibility of future resurgences of the COVID-19 pandemic, the continued effectiveness of our business continuity plan, including work-from-home arrangements, and\nstaffing at branches and certain other facilities, the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees, customers, counterparties and third-party service providers, as well as on other market participants, actions taken, or that may yet be taken, by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Future developments, including increased unemployment rates, or turbulence in U.S. or global financial markets could adversely affect our revenues and the values of our assets and liabilities, reduce the availability of funding, lead to a tightening of credit, and further increase stock price volatility. These and other potential impacts of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks of an illness, disease or virus could therefore materially and adversely affect our business, revenue, operations, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.\nAlthough financial markets have largely rebounded from the significant declines that occurred earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic conditions showed signs of improvement during the second half of 2020 and throughout 2021, many of the circumstances that arose or became more pronounced after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic persist, including:\n\u2022supply chain issues and decreased consumer and business confidence and economic activity, leading to certain lower loan demand and an increased risk of loan delinquencies, defaults, and foreclosures;\n\u2022ratings downgrades, credit deterioration and defaults in many industries, including, but not limited to, recreation and entertainment, hotels, and restaurants, as well as across consumer unsecured installment loans;\n\u2022volatility in financial and capital markets, interest rates, and exchange rates;\n\u2022declines in collateral values;\n\u2022increased demands on capital and liquidity;\n\u2022heightened cybersecurity, information security, and operational risks as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption resulting from the pandemic given increased online and remote activity, including as a result of work-from-home arrangements;\n\u2022disruptions to business operations experienced by counterparties and service providers; and\n\u2022increased risk of business disruption if our employees are unable to work effectively because of illness, quarantines, government actions, failures in systems or technology that disrupt work-from-home arrangements, or other effects of the COVID-19 pandemic; and decreased demands for our products and services.\nAs a result, our credit, operational, and certain other risks are generally expected to remain elevated until the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. Depending on the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic going forward, the conditions noted above could continue for an extended period and these or other adverse developments may occur or reoccur.\nThe length of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efficacy of the extraordinary measures being put in place to address it are unknown. There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the economic recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy may experience a recession, and we anticipate that our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by a recession. To the extent the pandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital, loans, asset quality, or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of the Form 10-K.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nLoss of deposits could increase our funding costs.\nWe rely on customer deposits to meet a considerable portion of our funding needs, and we continue to seek customer deposits to maintain this funding base. We accept deposits directly from consumer and commercial customers and, as of December 31, 2021, we had $5.2 billion in deposits. These deposits are subject to potential fluctuations in availability or the price we must pay (in the form of interest) to obtain them due to certain factors outside our control, such as increasing competitive pressures from other financial services firms for deposits and changes in interest rates and returns on other investment classes, which could result in significant outflows of deposits within short periods of time or significant changes in pricing necessary to maintain current deposits or attract additional deposits. The loss of customer deposits for any reason could increase our funding costs.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and changing industry and market area and compete with both banks and non-banks.\nWe operate in the highly competitive financial services industry and face significant competition for customers from financial institutions located both within and beyond our principal markets. We compete with national commercial banks, regional banks, private banks, savings banks, credit unions, non-bank financial services companies, FinTech companies and other financial institutions operating within or near the areas we serve, many of whom are much larger and have significantly greater resources than us and that target the same customers we do in the Chicago metropolitan area. In order to compete, we may have to pay higher interest rates to\nattract deposits, accept lower yields to attract loans and pay higher wages for new employees, resulting in lower net interest margins and reduced profitability. As customer preferences and expectations continue to evolve, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for banks to expand their geographic reach by providing digital banking services and for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. The banking industry is experiencing rapid changes in technology, and, as a result, our future success will depend in part on our ability to address our customers\u2019 needs by using technology. Many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern our activities and, as a result, may have greater flexibility in competing for business. We also face increased competition in our U.S. government guaranteed lending business, which can adversely affect our volume and the premium, if any, recognized on sales of the guaranteed portions of such U.S. government guaranteed loans. Our inability to compete successfully in the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur principal stockholder, MBG Investors I, L.P. has significant influence over us, and its interests could conflict with those of our other stockholders.\nCurrently, our principal stockholder, MBG Investors I, L.P., owns approximately 30.4% of the outstanding shares of our common stock and its general partner is one of our directors. As a result, MBG Investors I, L.P. is able to influence matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other extraordinary transactions. MBG Investors I, L.P. may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. The concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing, or deterring a change of control of the Company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a private sale of their shares of the Company, subject us to the influence of a presently unknown third-party and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market, including by our pre-IPO stockholders, could lower our stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock or from the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling equity securities in the future, at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nCertain of our pre-IPO stockholders, including affiliates such as MBG Investors, I, L.P., hold restricted shares that could be sold in accordance with the volume, manner of sale, and other limitations under Rule 144 or through registration under the Securities Act. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or sales of our common stock by our pre-IPO stockholders or the effect, if any, that future issuances or sales of shares of our common stock may have on the market price of our common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 16756, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BY"}
