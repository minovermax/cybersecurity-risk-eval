RISK FACTORS\nCovid-19 Pandemic Risks\nOur business, financial results, and prospects are dependent on global aerospace demand. The continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have had and are expected to continue to have a significant negative impact on aerospace demand, our business and our industry, including any potential impacts of vaccination requirements. Other epidemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases may have a similar impact. As previously disclosed, we face risks related to outbreaks of infectious diseases, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has caused significant volatility in financial markets, including the market price of our stock, and the aerospace industry. The continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have had and are expected to continue to have a significant negative impact on aviation demand, our business, our supply chain and our industry, including any potential impacts of vaccination requirements.\nThe extent to which the pandemic will continue to negatively affect our business and results of operations will depend on many changing factors and developments including, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022the severity, extent, and duration of the pandemic including emerging variants of the virus, its impact on the aircraft industry and aviation and related aftermarket demand, and any additional production suspensions or reductions relating to the pandemic;\n\u2022the effectiveness of vaccines and treatments against emerging variant strains of COVID-19 and over the long-term;\n\u2022continued travel restrictions and bans, bans on public gatherings, and closures of non-essential businesses;\n\u2022any potential impacts of vaccination requirements and the ability to retain and recruit the workforce required to meet production requirements;\n\u2022economic stimulus efforts;\n\u2022economic recessions resulting from the pandemic;\n\u2022any inability of significant portions of our workforce to work effectively, including because of illness, remote work, quarantines, social distancing, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022potential lawsuits or regulatory actions due to COVID-19 spread in the workplace;\n\u2022our ability to maintain our compliance practices and procedures, financial reporting processes and related controls, and manage the complex accounting issues presented by the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the impact on the Company\u2019s vendors and outsourced business processes and their process and controls documentation;\n\u2022potential failure or reduced capacity of third parties on which the Company relies, including suppliers, lenders, and other business partners, to meet the Company\u2019s obligations and needs;\n\u2022the impact of the pandemic on the financial position of our customers;\n\u2022the impact of the pandemic on the availability and cost of materials;\n\u2022the impact on our contracts with our customers and suppliers, including force majeure provisions;\n\u2022the impact on the financial markets, including volatility in the financial markets;\n\u2022the availability and cost of credit to the Company; and\n\u2022the impact of government health and protection policies on future air traffic demand.\nSeveral of these effects have already occurred and any or all of these items may occur or recur, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While the Company has taken action to reduce costs, increase liquidity and strengthen its financial position in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no assurance that our actions will mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our business.\nWe expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have a significant negative impact on our business for the duration of the pandemic and for an indeterminate time thereafter until demand grows closer to 2019 levels and supply chain challenges abate. Our business improvement depends on OEM production of aircraft at sufficient levels, which depends upon the public\u2019s willingness to use aircraft travel, the success of vaccination programs across the globe, sufficient OEM demand and orders (without suspension) from airlines, and the ability of airlines to weather the crisis and expand. Further, we expect that the pandemic recovery time for wide-body aircraft may be longer than for narrow-body aircraft due to reduced traveler demand and lower volumes of international travel. If the pandemic worsens or there is significant uncertainty on the commercial aerospace industry\u2019s recovery, we may find it difficult to obtain additional financing and/or fund our operations and meet our debt repayment obligations. Recognizing the unprecedented nature, scale and uncertainty associated with this global health crisis, the duration and extent of the on-going impacts cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nMarket Risks\nThe loss of Boeing or Panasonic as major customers or a significant reduction in business with either of those customers would reduce our sales and earnings. In 2021, we had a concentration of sales to Boeing representing approximately 10.0% of our sales. In 2020 and 2019, we also had a concentration of sales to Panasonic in excess of 10% of sales in those years. The loss of these customers or a significant reduction in business with them would significantly reduce our sales and earnings.\nIn October 2018 and March of 2019, two commercial aircraft accidents led to the grounding by the Federal Aviation Administration and other regulators of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, on which we have significant content, and which represented our largest OEM production program before the pandemic. The grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX, which started in March of 2019, caused the production rate of that aircraft to be lower than expected in fiscal year 2019 and 2020. The 737 MAX grounding affected our business both because of the production pause, impacting our line-fit content, and because it left many of our airline customers short of capacity, particularly in 2019 but continuing into 2020, which made them reluctant to take other aircraft out of service to install the types of retrofit products they buy from us. Although the 737 MAX was re-certified in the United States in November 2020 and in Europe in January 2021, if production rates do not materialize as anticipated, our Aerospace segment sales could be significantly impacted in the near or long-term, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Even as deliveries of the 737 MAX program resume, demand for the aircraft could be lower than was expected prior to the initial grounding of the aircraft due to the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe markets we serve are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and events, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate. Demand for our products is, to a large extent, dependent on the demand and success of our customers' products where we are a supplier to an OEM. In our Aerospace segment, demand by the business jet markets for our products is dependent upon several factors, including capital investment, product innovations, economic growth and wealth creation and technology upgrades. In addition, the commercial airline industry is highly cyclical and sensitive to such things as fuel price increases, labor disputes, global economic conditions, availability of capital to fund new aircraft purchases and upgrades of existing aircraft and passenger demand, all of which have been significantly impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A change in any of these factors could result in a further reduction in the amount of air travel and the ability of airlines to invest in new aircraft or to upgrade existing aircraft. These factors would reduce orders for new aircraft and would likely reduce airlines\u2019 spending for cabin upgrades for which we supply products, thus reducing our sales and profits. A reduction in air travel may also result in our commercial airline customers being unable to pay our invoices on a timely basis or not at all.\nWe are a supplier on various new aircraft programs just entering or expected to begin production in the future. As with any new program, there is risk as to whether the aircraft or program will be successful and accepted by the market. As is customary for our business, we purchase inventory and invest in specific capital equipment to support our production requirements generally based on delivery schedules provided by our customer. If a program or aircraft is not successful, we may have to write-off all or\na part of the inventory, accounts receivable and capital equipment related to the program. A write-off of these assets could result in a significant reduction of earnings and cause covenant violations relating to our debt agreements. This could result in our being unable to borrow additional funds under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our bank indebtedness.\nIn our Test Systems segment, the market for our products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment. In any one reporting period, a single customer or several customers may contribute an even larger percentage of our consolidated sales. In addition, our ability to increase sales will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain orders from current or new significant customers. The opportunities to obtain orders from these customers may be limited, which may impair our ability to grow sales. We expect that sales of our Test Systems products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future. Additionally, demand for some of our test products is dependent upon government funding levels for our products, our ability to compete successfully for those contracts and our ability to develop products to satisfy the demands of our customers.\nOur products are sold in highly competitive markets. Some of our competitors are larger, more diversified corporations and have greater financial, marketing, production and research and development resources. As a result, they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns. Our operations and financial performance will be negatively impacted if our competitors:\n\u2022develop products that are superior to our products;\n\u2022develop products that are more competitively priced than our products;\n\u2022develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services; or\n\u2022adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.\nWe believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality, price, design and engineering capabilities, product development, conformity to customer specifications, quality of support after the sale, timeliness of delivery and effectiveness of the distribution organization. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. If we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments, or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position, our operations and financial performance will suffer.\nWe depend on government contracts and subcontracts with defense prime contractors and subcontractors that may not be fully funded, may be terminated, or may be awarded to our competitors. The failure to be awarded these contracts, the failure to receive funding or the termination of one or more of these contracts could reduce our sales. Sales to the U.S. government and its prime contractors and subcontractors represent a significant portion of our business. The funding of these programs is generally subject to annual congressional appropriations, and congressional priorities are subject to change. In addition, government expenditures for defense programs may decline or these defense programs may be terminated. A decline in governmental expenditures or the termination of existing contracts may result in a reduction in the volume of contracts awarded to us. We have resources applied to specific government contracts and if any of those contracts were terminated, we may incur substantial costs redeploying those resources.\nContracting in the defense industry is subject to significant regulation, including rules related to bidding, billing and accounting kickbacks and false claims, and any non-compliance could subject us to fines and penalties or possible debarment. Like all government contractors, we are subject to risks associated with this contracting. These risks include the potential for substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in suspension or debarment from future government contracts.\nStrategic Risks\nWe may incur losses and liabilities as a result of our acquisition strategy. Growth by acquisition involves risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results, including:\n\u2022the potential exposure to unanticipated liabilities;\n\u2022the potential that expected benefits or synergies are not realized and that operating costs increase;\n\u2022the risks associated with incurring additional acquisition indebtedness, including that additional indebtedness could limit our cash flow availability for operations and our flexibility;\n\u2022difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies;\n\u2022the potential loss of key employees, suppliers or customers of acquired businesses; and\n\u2022diversion of management time and attention from our core business.\nIn addition, any acquisition, once successfully integrated, could negatively impact our financial performance if it does not perform as planned, does not increase earnings, or does not prove otherwise to be beneficial to us.\nIf we are unable to adapt to technological change, demand for our products may be reduced. The technologies related to our products have undergone, and in the future may undergo, significant changes. To succeed in the future, we will need to continue to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis. Our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we develop or that render our technology and products obsolete or uncompetitive. Furthermore, our products could become unmarketable if new industry standards emerge. We may have to modify our products significantly in the future to remain competitive, and new products we introduce may not be accepted by our customers.\nOur new product development efforts may not be successful, which would result in a reduction in our sales and earnings. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development of new products or product enhancements, and new products or product enhancements may not be accepted by our customers. In addition, the development expenses we incur may exceed our cost estimates, and new products we develop may not generate sales sufficient to offset our costs. If any of these events occur, our sales and profits could be adversely affected.\nOperational Risks\nOur business and operations could be adversely impacted in the event of a failure of our information technology infrastructure or adversely impacted by a successful cyber-attack. We are dependent on various information technologies throughout our Company to administer, store and support multiple business activities. We routinely experience various cybersecurity threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure, unauthorized attempts to gain access to our Company sensitive information, and denial-of-service attacks as do our customers, suppliers and subcontractors. We conduct regular periodic training of our employees as to the protection of sensitive information which includes security awareness training intended to prevent the success of \u201cphishing\u201d attacks.\nThe threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, including nation states, which target us and other defense contractors because we protect sensitive information. If we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures, and depending on the severity of the incident, our customers\u2019 data, our employees\u2019 data, our intellectual property, and other third-party data (such as subcontractors, suppliers and vendors) could be compromised. As a consequence of their persistence, sophistication and volume, we may not be successful in defending against all such attacks. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.\nAlthough we work cooperatively with our customers, suppliers, and subcontractors to seek to minimize the impact of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by these entities, which may affect the security of our information. These entities have varying levels of cybersecurity expertise and safeguards and their relationships with U.S. government contractors, such as Astronics, may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber threats we face.\nOur inability to adequately enforce and protect our intellectual property or defend against assertions of infringement could prevent or restrict our ability to compete. We rely on patents, trademarks and proprietary knowledge and technology, both internally developed and acquired, in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Our inability to defend against the unauthorized use of these rights and assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against claims of infringement. This litigation could result in significant costs and divert our management\u2019s focus away from operations. Refer to the risk factor related to pending patent infringement litigation below and Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.\nIf critical components or raw materials used to manufacture our products or used in our development programs become scarce or unavailable, then we may incur delays in manufacturing and delivery of our products and in completing our development programs, which has damaged, and could continue to damage, our business, results of operations and financial condition. Due to increased demand across a range of industries, the global supply chain for certain critical components or raw materials used in the manufacture of our products and used in our development programs has experienced significant strain in recent periods. Particularly, the market for electronic components is experiencing increased demand, creating substantial uncertainty regarding our suppliers\u2019 continued production of key components for our products. The COVID-19 pandemic has also contributed to and exacerbated this strain. This constrained supply environment has adversely\naffected, and could further affect, availability, lead times and cost of components, and could impact our ability to complete development programs, respond to accelerated or quick-turn delivery requests from customers, or meet customer demand and product delivery dates for our end customers where we cannot timely secure adequate supply of these components. Moreover, if any of our suppliers become financially unstable, or otherwise unable or unwilling to provide us with raw materials or components, then we may have to find new suppliers. It may take several months to locate alternative suppliers, if required, or to redesign our products to accommodate components from different suppliers. We may experience significant delays in manufacturing and shipping our products to customers and incur additional development, manufacturing and other costs to establish alternative sources of supply if we lose any of these sources or are required to redesign our products. We cannot predict if we will be able to obtain replacement components within the time frames that we require at an acceptable cost, if at all.\nIn an effort to mitigate these risks, in some cases, we have incurred higher costs to secure available inventory, or have extended or placed non-cancellable purchase commitments with suppliers, which introduces inventory risk if our forecasts and assumptions prove inaccurate. While we may attempt to recover the increased costs through price increases to our customers, we may be unable to mitigate the effect on our results of operations. We have also multi-sourced and pre-ordered components and raw materials inventory in some cases in an effort to reduce the impact of the adverse supply chain conditions we have experienced. Despite our attempts to mitigate the impact on our business, these constrained supply conditions are expected to adversely impact our costs of goods sold, including our ability to continue to reduce the cost to produce our products in a manner consistent with prior periods. In addition, some suppliers have indicated that, as a result of current shortages, they intend to cease manufacture of certain components used in our products. Limits on manufacturing availability or capacity or delays in production or delivery of components or raw materials due to COVID-related restrictions could further delay or inhibit our ability to obtain supply of components and produce finished goods. There can be no assurance that the impacts of the pandemic on the supply chain will not continue, or worsen, in the future. These supply chain constraints and their related challenges could result in shortages, increased material costs or use of cash, engineering design changes, and delays in new product introductions, each of which could adversely impact our growth, gross margin and financial results. These types of negative financial impacts on our business may become more acute as supply chain pressures increase.\nOur financial results could be adversely impacted by the escalation of labor and benefit costs. Consistent with the experience of other employers, our labor, medical and workers\u2019 compensation costs have increased substantially in recent years and are expected to continue to rise. If this trend continues, the cost of labor and to provide healthcare and other benefits to our employees could increase, adversely impacting profitability. As the labor market recovers from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, competition for employees has escalated which has increased costs associated with attracting and retaining employees. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequately skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently or that our labor costs will not increase as a result of a shortage in the availability of skilled employees. Changes to healthcare regulations involving the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may also increase the cost of providing such benefits to our employees. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing, or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation or related proposals and policies on our results. Any significant increases in the costs attributable to our self-insured health and workers\u2019 compensation plans could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nGovernment vaccine mandates could result in workforce attrition for us and our suppliers which could adversely affect our operations and supply chain. On September 9, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order requiring all employers with U.S. Government contracts to ensure that their U.S.-based employees, contractors, and subcontractors, that work in affected facilities or work on or in support of U.S. Government contracts are fully vaccinated. The deadline for vaccination was initially December 8, 2021, but the White House announced on November 4, 2021 that the deadline would be extended to January 4, 2022. The executive order includes on-site and remote U.S.-based employees, contractors and subcontractors and permits only limited exceptions for medical and religious reasons. Substantially all of our subsidiaries are either directly subject to the executive order, or will be required to comply with the executive order via flowdown from our affected customers. It is currently not possible to predict with certainty the impact the executive order will have on our workforce, or on our suppliers who may also be impacted. As a U.S. Government contractor, and as a supplier to customers who are U.S. Government contractors, we took steps to comply with the executive order mandating COVID-19 vaccines across our U.S.-based workforce, contractors and subcontractors that service or support our U.S. Government contracts, and who do not qualify for medical or religious exemptions, to be fully vaccinated by January 4, 2022, until it was enjoined by a federal court in December 2021. The vaccine mandate currently remains enjoined and the Government has announced that it will take no efforts to enforce it, absent further notice from the contracting agency, where the place of performance is a U.S. state or an excluded outlying area. If the vaccine mandate is revived, the Company will resume efforts to work with employees who have not yet either submitted proof of vaccination or requested an accommodation. Additional vaccine mandates may be announced in jurisdictions in which our businesses operate. Implementation of these requirements may result in attrition, including attrition of critically skilled labor, and difficulty securing future labor needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. Further, implementation of these requirements by our suppliers may result in workforce attrition at our suppliers, which may result in disruption to our supply chain which, in turn, may have a negative impact on our revenues and results of operations by impacting ability to acquire certain raw materials and components used in the manufacture of our products and in our development programs.\nIf our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations, our prime contract performance and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted. Many of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or customer concerns about the subcontractor. Failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide, on a timely basis, the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations with our customer and could result in the assessment of late delivery penalties. Subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a customer terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders.\nSome of our contracts contain late delivery penalties. Failure to deliver in a timely manner due to supplier problems, development schedule slides, manufacturing difficulties, or similar schedule-related events could have a material adverse effect on our business. No significant penalties have been incurred to date.\nOur results of operations are affected by our fixed-price contracts, which could subject us to losses in the event that we have cost overruns. For the year ended December 31, 2021, fixed-price contracts represented almost all of the Company\u2019s sales. On fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the scope of work specified in the contract for a predetermined price. Depending on the fixed price negotiated, these contacts may provide us with an opportunity to achieve higher profits based on the relationship between our costs and the contract\u2019s fixed price. However, we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit.\nThe failure of our products may damage our reputation, necessitate a product recall or result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage, thereby requiring us to pay significant damages. Defects in the design and manufacture of our products may necessitate a product recall. We include complex system design and components in our products that could contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products. If any of our products are defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. Such an event could result in significant expenses, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products. We are also exposed to product liability claims. We carry aircraft and non-aircraft product liability insurance consistent with industry norms. However, this insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover the payment of any potential claim. A product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFinancial Risks\nWe are subject to debt covenant restrictions. The terms of our credit facility may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to take certain actions. Our credit facility contains certain financial covenants. An unexpected decline in our operating income could cause us to violate our covenants. A covenant violation could result in a default under the revolving credit facility. If any such default occurs, the lenders may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. In addition, following an event of default, the lenders under the credit facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which includes our available cash. If the debt under the credit facility were to be accelerated, we cannot assure that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt.\nAdditionally, our credit facility also contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on the Company and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests. The credit facility includes covenants restricting, among other things, the ability of the Company to:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022make certain acquisitions or investments;\n\u2022sell assets; and\n\u2022engage in certain business activities.\nThe amount of debt we have outstanding, as well as any debt we may incur in the future, could have an adverse effect on our operational and financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $163.0 million of long-term debt outstanding. Changes to our level of debt subsequent to December 31, 2021 could have significant consequences to our business, including the following:\n\u2022Depending on interest rates and debt maturities, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be dedicated to paying principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for our acquisition strategy, capital expenditures or other purposes;\n\u2022A significant amount of additional debt could make us more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions or increases in prevailing interest rates;\n\u2022Our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, capital expenditures or for other purposes could be impaired;\n\u2022The increase in the amount of debt we have outstanding and the associated interest expense increases the risk of non-compliance with some of the covenants in our debt agreements which require us to maintain specified financial ratios; and\n\u2022We may be more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may result in a competitive disadvantage.\nOur inability to refinance our existing long-term debt maturing in 2023 on terms that are favorable to us may materially and adversely impact our operations and future growth and expansion initiatives. Our credit facility, of which $163.0 million is outstanding as of December 31, 2021, is currently scheduled to mature in 2023. While we expect to be able to refinance, replace or extend the maturity date of our credit facility before it matures, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain such debt refinancing on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The extent to which we will be able to effect such refinancing, replacement or maturity extension on terms that are favorable to us or at all is dependent on a number of highly uncertain factors, including then-prevailing credit and other market conditions, economic conditions, particularly in the aerospace and defense markets, disruptions or volatility caused by factors such as COVID-19, regional conflicts, inflation, and supply chain disruptions. In addition, rising interest rates could limit our ability to refinance our existing credit facility when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing. As the Company\u2019s long-term debt approaches maturity, if the Company is unable to refinance, replace or extend the maturity on its credit facility, the Company\u2019s liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted.\nFurthermore, certain covenants and other terms of our existing credit facility impose significant restrictions on our operational flexibility. In connection with debt refinancing, our ability to negotiate more favorable and flexible covenants and terms, including financial covenants, is highly uncertain. An inability to complete our debt refinancing on terms that are more favorable to us than the covenants and terms in effect under our existing credit facility could materially and adversely impact our business, operations and future growth and expansion initiatives. In particular, if the covenants and terms under our refinanced indebtedness were to remain unchanged as compared to those under our current credit facility, we may be required to take certain operational measures or decline to pursue certain growth initiatives in order to maintain compliance with these restrictive covenants and terms, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA write-off of all or part of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our operating results and net worth. At December 31, 2021, goodwill and net intangible assets were approximately 9.6% and 15.5% of our total assets, respectively. In 2020, we recorded goodwill impairment charges associated with four Aerospace reporting units, totaling $86.3 million. In 2019, we recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $1.6 million and $6.2 million related to our AeroSat antenna business, respectively. We had no such impairment charges during 2021. Our goodwill and other intangible assets may increase in the future since our strategy includes growing through acquisitions. We may have to write-off all or part of our goodwill or purchased intangible assets if their value becomes impaired. Although this write-off would not result in an outlay of cash, it could reduce our earnings and net worth significantly.\nWe are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks that could adversely affect our business, liquidity and operating results. Changes in the availability, terms and cost of capital, and increases in interest rates could cause our cost of doing business to increase and place us at a competitive disadvantage. At December 31, 2021, all of our debt was subject to variable interest rates.\nThe potential phase out of LIBOR may negatively impact our debt agreements and financial position, results of operations and liquidity. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 and it is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established. If LIBOR ceases to exist after 2021, a comparable or successor reference rate as approved by the Administrative Agent under the Credit Agreement will apply or such other reference rate as may be agreed by the Company and the lenders under the Credit Agreement. Prior to its amendment on March 1, 2022, the interest rate under our Amended Credit Facility was calculated using LIBOR. In conjunction with the amendment, our Amended Credit Facility is now based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), rather than LIBOR. However, that agreement\nexpires in May 2023 and it is unclear at this time whether different benchmark rates used to price indebtedness will develop. We cannot predict the impact that an alternative benchmark rate may have on the terms of our future indebtedness or interest cost. However, an increase in our cost of borrowing could result in an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nOur future operating results could be impacted by estimates used to calculate impairment losses on long-lived assets. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant and subjective estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of tangible and intangible long-lived assets in the financial statements. These estimates are integral in the determination of whether a potential non-cash impairment loss exists as well as the calculation of that loss. Actual future results could differ from those estimates. As discussed in Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report, we recorded a long-lived asset impairment charge of approximately $0.7 million and $9.5 million in the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We had no such impairment charges in 2021.\nChanges in discount rates and other estimates could affect our future earnings and equity. Our goodwill asset impairment evaluations are determined using valuations that involve several assumptions, including discount rates, cash flow estimates, growth rates and terminal values. Certain of these assumptions, particularly the discount rate, are based on market conditions and are outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity.\nAdditionally, pension obligations and the related costs are determined using actual results and actuarial valuations that involve several assumptions. The most critical assumption is the discount rate. Other assumptions include mortality, salary levels and retirement age. The discount rate assumptions are based on current market conditions and are outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity.\nLegal and Compliance Risks\nWe currently are involved or may become involved in the future, in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could materially impact our financial condition. As an aerospace company, we may become a party to litigation in the ordinary course of our business, including, among others, matters alleging product liability, warranty claims, breach of commercial or government contract or other legal actions. In general, litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact results of operations and financial condition.\nCurrently, our subsidiary, AES is a defendant in actions filed in various jurisdictions by Lufthansa Technik AG relating to an allegation of patent infringement and based on rulings to date we have concluded that losses related to these proceedings are probable. If these actions are decided adversely against the Company, the associated damages could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nRefer to Note 19 of our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for discussion on this and other legal proceedings. Other than these proceedings, we are not party to any significant pending legal proceedings that management believes will result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur operations in foreign countries expose us to political and currency risks and adverse changes in local legal and regulatory environments. In 2021, approximately 8% of our sales were made by our subsidiaries in foreign countries, predominately in our subsidiaries in France and Canada. Net assets held by our foreign subsidiaries total $40.5 million at December 31, 2021. Approximately 21% of our consolidated sales in 2021 were made to customers outside of the United States. Our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies and by the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from local currencies into U.S. dollars. We expect international operations and export sales to continue to contribute to our earnings for the foreseeable future. Both the sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside of the U.S. Such risks include the possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations, changes in tariff and trade barriers and import or export licensing requirements, and political or economic reprioritization, insurrection, civil disturbance or war.\nGovernment regulations could limit our ability to sell our products outside the U.S. and could otherwise adversely affect our business. Certain of our sales are subject to compliance with U.S. export regulations. Our failure to obtain, or fully adhere to the limitations contained in, the requisite licenses, meet registration standards or comply with other government export regulations would hinder our ability to generate sales of our products outside the U.S. Compliance with these government regulations may also subject us to additional fees and operating costs. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In order to sell our products in European Union countries, we must satisfy certain technical requirements. If we are unable to comply with those requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products, our sales in Europe would be restricted. Doing business internationally also subjects us to numerous\nU.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, foreign corrupt practices and anti-boycott provisions. Our failure, or failure by an authorized agent or representative that is attributable to us, to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in monetary penalties, suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which would have a material adverse effect on us.\nGeneral Risks\nOur future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team and technical personnel. The loss of members of our management team could have a material and adverse effect on our business. In addition, competition for qualified technical personnel in our industry is intense, and we believe that our future growth and success will depend on our ability to attract, train and retain such personnel.\nFuture terror attacks, war, or other civil disturbances could negatively impact our business. Continued terror attacks, war or other disturbances could lead to economic instability and decreases in demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Terrorist attacks world-wide have caused instability from time to time in global financial markets and the aviation industry. The long-term effects of terrorist attacks on us are unknown. These attacks and the U.S. government\u2019s continued efforts against terrorist organizations may lead to additional armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the U.S. or elsewhere, which may further contribute to economic instability.\nIf we fail to meet expectations of securities analysts or investors due to fluctuations in our sales or operating results, our stock price could decline significantly. Our sales and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, including delays or cancellations of programs and the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on revenues and costs. It is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. In this event, the trading price of our stock could decline significantly.\nOur stock price is volatile. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our stock price ranged from a low of $10.04 to a high of $20.51. The price of our common stock has been and likely will continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of events and factors, such as:\n\u2022quarterly variations in operating results;\n\u2022variances of our quarterly results of operations from securities analyst estimates;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates;\n\u2022announcements of technological innovations and new products;\n\u2022news reports relating to trends in our markets;\n\u2022the cancellation of major contracts or programs with our customers; and\n\u2022impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the aerospace industry and our Company.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for companies in the aerospace and defense industry in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies affected by these fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Global health crises, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, with the breadth of its impact worldwide, and particularly on the aerospace industry, could also cause significant volatility in the market price.", "PERMNO": 15457, "SIC": 3640, "TIC": "ATRO"}
