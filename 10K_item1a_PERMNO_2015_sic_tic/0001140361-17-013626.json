You should consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this report, which could materially adversely affect our proposed operations, our business prospects, and financial condition, and the value of an investment in our business. There may be other factors that are not mentioned here or of which we are not presently aware that could also affect our business operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nWe have a history of operating losses and negative cash flows.\nSince our inception in September 2012, we have incurred operating losses and negative cash flow, and we expect to continue to incur losses and negative cash flow in the future. Our net losses for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $35.5 million, $15.0 million, and $10.1 million respectively, and we had an accumulated deficit of $83.7 million and $48.2 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We have limited cash resources and will depend upon future equity financings, research grants, available through collaborations with third parties, and sales of BioTime and OncoCyte common shares that we have as a source of funding for our operations. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the financing we need from any of those sources, or that any such financing that may become available will be on terms that are favorable to us and our shareholders.\nFailure to attract and retain skilled personnel and key relationships could impair our research and development efforts.\nWe will need to recruit and hire additional qualified research scientists, laboratory technicians, clinical development, and management personnel as we continue to develop our programs. Competition for these types of personnel is intense and we may experience delays in hiring the qualified people that we need. The inability to attract and retain sufficient qualified management, scientific, or technical personnel may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. We partially rely on BioTime to provide certain services related to financial accounting management and reporting. We will also rely on consultants and advisors who are either self-employed or employed by other organizations, and they may have conflicts of interest or other commitments, such as consulting or advisory contracts with other organizations, that may affect their ability to perform services for us.\nWe will spend a substantial amount of our capital on research and development but we might not succeed in developing products and technologies that are useful in medicine.\nThe product development work we plan to do is costly, time consuming and uncertain as to its results. We will attempt to develop new medical products and technologies that might not prove to be safe and efficacious in human medical applications. Many of the products and technologies that we will seek to develop have not been applied in human medicine and have only been used in laboratory studies in vitro or in animals. Only two of the product candidates that we acquired had been used in clinical trials at the time of acquisition, and those were early stage trials involving only a small number of patients. Even if we are successful in developing a new technology or product, refinement of the new technology or product and definition of the practical applications and limitations of the technology or product may take years and require the expenditure of large sums of money.\nThe amount and pace of research and development work that we can do or sponsor, and our ability to commence and complete clinical trials required to obtain FDA and foreign regulatory approval of our products, depends upon the amount of funding available to us.\nWe may have to limit our laboratory research and development work based on the amount of our cash resources. We plan to continue to seek research and development grants from government agencies and to enter into collaborative product development agreements through which third parties will provide funding or otherwise bear the cost of research and development or clinical trials of our product candidates. There is no assurance that the amount of any grants that we may receive will be adequate for our needs. The agreements we entered into to date with CIRM and CRUK are subject to termination if certain milestones are not achieved. Hence, there is no assurance that we will receive the full value of the agreement with either entity. Unless we are able to generate sufficient revenue or raise additional funds when needed, it is likely that we will be unable to continue our planned activities, even if we make progress in our research and development projects.\nWe will need to issue additional equity or debt securities in order to raise additional capital needed to pay our operating expenses.\nWe plan to incur substantial research and product development expenses, and we will need to raise additional capital to pay operating expenses until we are able to generate sufficient revenues from product sales, royalties, and license fees. Additional sales of equity or debt securities will be required in the future to meet our capital needs, unless we receive substantial research grants and revenues from the sale of any products that receive regulatory approval or we are successful in licensing or sublicensing our technology and we receive substantial licensing fees and royalties. Sales of additional equity securities could result in the dilution of the interests of present shareholders.\nThe availability of cells could impact the time and cost of commencing our research and product development programs.\nThe cells, cell lines and other biological materials that we acquired are being stored under cryopreservation protocols intended to preserve their functionality. We have successfully completed the verification of the viability of three lots of AST-OPC1 cells that we intend to use in our current SciStar Phase 1/2a study and our next anticipated clinical trial. However, we do not have sufficient amounts of AST-OPC1 cells to conduct a larger registration trial or for future commercial activities. We are developing additional cell banks and scaling up our process to generate sufficient amounts of AST-OPC1 cells for use in a larger registration trial and any future commercial activities. These process development and manufacturing-related activities increase the costs of our product development for AST-OPC1 and any delays in these activities could delay the overall AST-OPC1 program.\nAny products that receive regulatory approval may be difficult and expensive to manufacture on a commercial scale.\nhES derived therapeutic cells have only been produced on a small scale and not in quantities and at levels of purity and viability that will be needed for wide scale commercialization. If we are successful in developing products that consist of hES cells or other cells or products derived from hES or other cells, we will need to develop, alone or in collaboration with one or more pharmaceutical companies or contract manufacturers, technology for the commercial production of those products. Our hES cell or other cell-based products are likely to be more expensive to manufacture on a commercial scale than most other drugs on the market today. The high cost of manufacturing a product will require that we charge our customers a high price for the product in order to cover our costs and earn a profit. If the price of our products is too high, hospitals and physicians may be reluctant to purchase our products, especially if lower priced alternative products are available, and we may not be able to sell our products in sufficient volumes to recover our costs of development and manufacture or to earn a profit.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approvals for our therapeutic product candidates.\nWe will need to rely on third parties, such as CRUK, contract research organizations, data management companies, contract clinical research associates, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct any clinical trials that we may undertake for our products. We may also rely on third parties to assist with our preclinical development of therapeutic product candidates. If we outsource clinical trials, we may be unable to directly control the timing, conduct and expense of our clinical trials. If we enlist third parties to conduct clinical trials and they fail to successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines, if the third parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our preclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our therapeutic product candidates.\nWe will have certain obligations and may incur liabilities arising from clinical trials, and we do not yet know the scope of any resulting expenses that might arise.\nWe face the risk of incurring liabilities to patients who participate in clinical trials of our product candidates if they incur any injuries as a result of their participation. We will also be obligated to obtain information and prepare reports about the health of the clinical trial patients. In addition, we have assumed Geron\u2019s obligations to obtain information and prepare reports about the health of patients, and we have assumed any liabilities to those patients that might arise from any injuries they may have incurred, as a result of their participation in the clinical trials of Geron\u2019s GRN-OPC1 cell replacement therapy for spinal cord damage and its GRN-VAC1 immunological therapy for certain cancers. We are not aware of any claims by patients alleging injuries suffered as a result of any of those clinical trials, but if any claims are made and if liability can be established, the amount of any liability that we may incur, depending upon the nature and extent of any provable injuries, could exceed our insurance coverage, and the amount of the liability could be material to our financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we lose the services of the key personnel upon whom we depend.\nOur research and development programs are directed primarily by our President of Research and Development, Dr. Jane S. Lebkowski, our Chief Operating Officer, Dr. Katharine E. Spink, and our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Edward D. Wirth, III. In addition, our success depends to a large extent on our President and CEO, Stephen L. Cartt, and our Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel, Ryan D. Chavez. If any of these key personnel should leave our employ we may be unable to locate and recruit sufficient replacement personnel without undue delay or additional cost or we may be unable to replace them at all. Any such delay or inability could delay or terminate some or all of our research programs, the commercialization of our products, or our ability to raise capital to fund our business. Even if we are able to attract suitable replacement personnel, we may incur delays during a transition period. Therefore, the loss of these key employees and others within our organization could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such events could cause interruption of our operations. For example, the loss of data for our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory filings and development efforts and significantly increase our costs. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nFailure of our internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Our growth and entry into new products, technologies and markets will place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud.\nWe continue to rely in part on financial systems maintained by BioTime and upon certain financial reporting services provided by BioTime personnel. BioTime allocates certain expenses among itself, us, and BioTime\u2019s other subsidiaries, which create a risk that the allocations may not accurately reflect the benefit of an expenditure or use of financial or other resources by us, BioTime as our parent company, and the BioTime subsidiaries among which the allocations are made.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe will face certain risks arising from regulatory, legal, and economic factors that affect our business and the business of other pharmaceutical and biological product development companies. Because we are a small company with limited revenues and limited capital resources, we may be less able to bear the financial impact of these risks than larger companies that have substantial income and available capital.\nIf we do not receive FDA or other regulatory approvals, we will not be permitted to sell our products.\nThe cell-based products that we are developing cannot be sold until the FDA or corresponding foreign regulatory authorities approve the products for medical use. The need to obtain regulatory approval to market a new product means that:\n\u00b7\nwe will have to conduct expensive and time consuming clinical trials of new products. The full cost of conducting and completing clinical trials necessary to obtain FDA and foreign regulatory approval of a new product cannot be presently determined, but could exceed our current financial resources;\n\u00b7\nclinical trials and the regulatory approval process for a cell-based product can take several years to complete. As a result, we will incur the expense and delay inherent in seeking FDA and foreign regulatory approval of new products, even if the results of clinical trials are favorable;\n\u00b7\ndata obtained from preclinical and clinical studies is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory agency approvals. Delays in the regulatory approval process or rejections of an application for approval of a new drug or cell-based product may be encountered as a result of changes in regulatory agency policy;\n\u00b7\nbecause the therapeutic products we plan to develop with hES technology involve the application of new technologies and approaches to medicine, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may subject those products to additional or more stringent review than drugs or biologics derived from other technologies. No therapeutic product based on hES technology has been approved by the FDA to date.\n\u00b7\na product that is approved may be subject to restrictions on use;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA can limit or withdraw approval of a product if problems arise; and\n\u00b7\nwe will face similar regulatory issues in foreign countries.\nClinical trial failures can occur at any stage of the testing and we may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent commercialization of our current or future therapeutic product candidates.\nAll of our product candidates are either at early stages of clinical development or at the preclinical or research stages of development. Clinical trial failures or delays can occur at any stage of the trials, and may be directly or indirectly caused by a variety of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u00b7\ndelays in securing clinical investigators or trial sites for our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\ndelays in obtaining Institutional Review Board (\u201cIRB\u201d) and other regulatory approvals to commence a clinical trial;\n\u00b7\nslower than anticipated rates of patient recruitment and enrollment, or failing to reach the targeted number of patients due to competition for patients from other trials;\n\u00b7\nlimited or no availability of coverage, reimbursement and adequate payment from health maintenance organizations (\u201cHMOs\u201d) and other third party payors for the use of agents used in our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nnegative or inconclusive results from clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nunforeseen side effects interrupting, delaying, or halting clinical trials of our therapeutic product candidates, and possibly resulting in the FDA or other regulatory authorities denying approval of our therapeutic product candidates;\n\u00b7\nunforeseen safety issues;\n\u00b7\nuncertain dosing issues;\n\u00b7\napproval and introduction of new therapies or changes in standards of practice or regulatory guidance that render our clinical trial endpoints or the targeting of our proposed indications obsolete;\n\u00b7\ninability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment or problems with investigator or patient compliance with the trial protocols;\n\u00b7\ninability to replicate in large controlled studies safety and efficacy data obtained from a limited number of patients in uncontrolled trials;\n\u00b7\ninability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols; and\n\u00b7\nunavailability of clinical trial product or other materials.\nGovernment imposed bans or restrictions, and religious, moral and ethical concerns on the use of hES cells could prevent us from developing and successfully marketing stem-cell derived products.\nGovernment imposed bans or restrictions on the use of embryos or hES cells research and development in the United States and abroad could generally constrain stem cell research, thereby limiting the market and demand for any of our products that receive regulatory approval. In March 2009, President Barack Obama lifted certain restrictions on federal funding of research involving the use of hES cells, and in accordance with President Obama\u2019s executive order, the NIH has adopted new guidelines for determining the eligibility of hES cell lines for use in federally funded research. The central focus of the proposed guidelines is to assure that hES cells used in federally funded research were derived from human embryos that were created for reproductive purposes, were no longer needed for this purpose, and were voluntarily donated for research purposes with the informed written consent of the donors. hES cells that were derived from embryos created for research purposes rather than reproductive purposes, and other hES cells that were not derived in compliance with the guidelines, are not eligible for use in federally funded research.\nIn May 2016, the Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives of the United States House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce (the \u201cPanel\u201d) submitted a formal request that we provide certain information relating to, among other things, whether we have used fetal tissue in our research. We fully complied with this request and have provided evidence, to the Panel\u2019s full satisfaction, that we have never used fetal tissue in our research, as we only use specific hES cell lines that were deemed eligible for federal funding based on their original derivation by third parties according to ethical principles. We also provided evidence supporting that President George W. Bush in August 2001 signed an executive order approving, for research purposes, the use of these specific cell lines, among certain others, and approval for their use was subsequently reconfirmed under President Obama\u2019s March 2009 executive order.\nCalifornia law requires that stem cell research be conducted under the oversight of a SCRO committee. Many kinds of stem cell research, including the derivation of new hES cell lines, may only be conducted in California with the prior written approval of the SCRO committee. A SCRO committee could prohibit or impose restrictions on the research we plan to do.\nThe use of hES cells gives rise to religious, moral and ethical issues regarding the appropriate means of obtaining the cells and the appropriate use and disposal of the cells. These considerations could lead to more restrictive government regulations or could generally constrain stem cell research thereby limiting the market and demand for any of our products that receive regulatory approval. From time to time, social views on religious, moral and ethical issues could change and could affect political viewpoints and government regulations. Therefore, it is difficult to forecast with certainty whether there will be additional government imposed bans or restrictions, and religious, moral and ethical concerns on our use of hES cells that could potentially give rise to proceedings, litigation or disputes that could cause us to incur substantial expense, require significant time and attention from our management and result in civil penalties against us. The results of any such proceedings, litigation or disputes could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Furthermore, it is possible that such proceedings, litigation or disputes could negatively impact the ability of our vendors, suppliers or collaborators to conduct their operations, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf our efforts to protect our proprietary technologies are not adequate, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and contractual arrangements to protect the intellectual property related to our technologies. We will only be able to protect our products and proprietary information and technology by preventing unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that our patents, trade secrets, and contractual position allow us to do so. Any disclosure to or misappropriation by third parties of our trade secrets or confidential information could compromise our competitive position. Moreover, we have in the past been involved in, and may in the future be involved in legal or administrative proceedings involving our intellectual property and initiated by third parties, which proceedings can result in significant costs and commitment of management time and attention. As our product candidates continue in development, third parties may attempt to challenge the validity and enforceability of our patents and proprietary information and technologies.\nWe also have in the past been involved in, and may in the future be involved in initiating legal or administrative proceedings involving the product candidates and intellectual property of our competitors. These proceedings can result in significant costs and commitment of management time and attention, and there can be no assurance that our efforts would be successful in preventing or limiting the ability of our competitors to market competing products. Composition-of-matter patents relating to the active pharmaceutical ingredient are generally considered to be the strongest form of intellectual property protection for pharmaceutical products, as such patents provide protection not limited to any one method of use or manufacture. Method-of-use and method-of-manufacture patents protect the use or manufacture of a product for the specified method(s), and do not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product but produced using a method that is outside the scope of our patented method or for an indication that is outside the scope of our patented use. We rely on a combination of these and other types of patents to protect our product candidates, and there can be no assurance that our intellectual property will create and sustain the competitive position of our product candidates.\nBiotechnology and pharmaceutical product patents involve highly complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. Any patent applications that we own or license may fail to result in issued patents. Even if patents do successfully issue from our applications, third parties may challenge their validity or enforceability, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated, or held unenforceable. Even if our patents and patent applications are not challenged by third parties, those patents and patent applications may not prevent others from designing around our claims and may not otherwise adequately protect our product candidates. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents and patent applications we hold with respect to our product candidates is threatened, competitors with significantly greater resources could threaten our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\nSubject to meeting other requirements for patentability, for United States patent applications filed prior to March 16, 2013, the first to invent the claimed invention is entitled to receive patent protection for that invention while, outside the United States, the first to file a patent application encompassing the invention is entitled to patent protection for the invention. The United States moved to a \u201cfirst to file\u201d system under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or AIA, effective March 16, 2013. Discoveries are generally published in the scientific literature well after their actual development, and patent applications in the United States and other countries are typically not published until 18 months after filing and in some cases are never published. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned and licensed United States patents or patent applications filed prior to March 16, 2013, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection for inventions claimed in foreign patents or foreign patent applications and United States patents or patent applications filed on or after March 16, 2013. The AIA also includes new procedures for challenging issued patents and pending patent applications, which creates additional uncertainty. We may become involved in opposition or interference proceedings challenging our patents and patent applications or the patents and patent applications of others, and the outcome of any such proceedings are highly uncertain. An unfavorable outcome in any such proceedings could reduce the scope of, or invalidate our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology and compete directly with us, or result in our inability to manufacture, develop or commercialize our product candidates without infringing the patent rights of others.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we seek to rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how, information, or technology that is not covered by our patents. Although our agreements require all of our employees to assign their inventions to us, and we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our trade secrets, proprietary know-how and other confidential information and technology to enter into appropriate confidentiality agreements, we cannot be certain that our trade secrets, proprietary know-how and other confidential information and technology will not be subject to unauthorized disclosure or that our competitors will not otherwise gain access to or independently develop substantially equivalent trade secrets, proprietary know-how and other information and technology. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property globally. If we are unable to prevent unauthorized disclosure of our intellectual property related to our product candidates and technology to third parties, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business and operations.\nIntellectual property disputes with third parties and competitors may be costly and time consuming, and may negatively affect our competitive position.\nOur commercial success may depend on our avoiding infringement of the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties as well as on enforcing our patents and other proprietary rights against third parties. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology intellectual property disputes are characterized by complex, lengthy and expensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights. We may initiate or become a party to, or be threatened with, future litigation or other proceedings regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our product candidates and competing products.\nAs our product candidates progress toward commercialization, we or our collaboration partners may be subject to patent infringement claims from third parties. The patent landscape in competitive product areas is highly complex, and there may be patents of third parties of which we are unaware that may result in claims of infringement. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our product candidates do not infringe proprietary rights of third parties, and parties making claims against us may seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could potentially block further efforts to develop and commercialize our product candidates. Any litigation involving defense against claims of infringement, regardless of the merit of such claims, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of management time.\nWe intend, if necessary, to vigorously enforce our intellectual property in order to protect the proprietary position of our product candidates. Efforts to enforce our patents may include litigation, administrative proceedings, or both, depending on the potential benefits that might be available from those actions and the costs associated with undertaking those efforts against third parties. We carefully review and monitor publicly available information regarding products that may be competitive with our product candidates and assert our intellectual property rights where appropriate.\nWe may consider administrative proceedings and other means for challenging third party patents and patent applications. Third parties may also challenge our patents and patent applications, through interference, reexamination, inter partes review, and post-grant review proceedings before the USPTO or through other comparable proceedings, such as oppositions or invalidation proceedings, before foreign patent offices. An unfavorable outcome in any such challenge could require us to cease using the related technology and to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing third party, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, in which case our business could be harmed. Even if we are successful, participation in administrative proceedings before the USPTO or a foreign patent office may result in substantial costs and time on the part of our management and other employees.\nFurthermore, there is a risk that any public announcements concerning the status or outcomes of intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings may adversely affect the price of our stock. If securities analysts or our investors interpret such status or outcomes as negative or otherwise creating uncertainty, our common stock price may be adversely affected.\nOur reliance on third parties and agreements with collaboration partners requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor may discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.\nOur reliance on third party contractors to develop and manufacture our product candidates is based upon agreements that limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, including our trade secrets and know-how. Despite the contractual provisions, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets and information are disclosed or used, even if unintentionally, in violation of these agreements. In the highly competitive markets in which our product candidates are expected to compete, protecting our trade secrets, including our strategies for addressing competing products, is imperative, and any unauthorized use or disclosure could impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nIn addition, our collaboration partners are larger, more complex organizations than ours, and the risk of inadvertent disclosure of our proprietary information may be increased despite their internal procedures and contractual obligations in place with our collaboration partners. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and other confidential information, a competitor\u2019s discovery of such trade secrets and information could impair our competitive position and have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe have an extensive worldwide patent portfolio. The cost of maintaining our patent protection is high and maintaining our patent protection requires continuous review and compliance in order to maintain worldwide patent protection. We may not be able to effectively maintain our intellectual property position throughout the major markets of the world.\nThe USPTO and foreign patent authorities require maintenance fees and payments as well as continued compliance with a number of procedural and documentary requirements. Noncompliance may result in abandonment or lapse of the subject patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance may result in reduced royalty payments for lack of patent coverage in a particular jurisdiction from our collaboration partners or may result in competition, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have made, and will continue to make, certain strategic decisions in balancing costs and the potential protection afforded by the patent laws of certain countries. As a result, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries throughout the world, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other countries. Third parties may use our technologies in territories in which we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may infringe our patents in territories which provide inadequate enforcement mechanisms, even if we have patent protection. Such third party products may compete with our product candidates, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States, and we may encounter significant problems in securing and defending our intellectual property rights outside the United States.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain countries. The legal systems of certain countries do not always favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, particularly those relating to pharmaceutical and biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop infringement of our patents, misappropriation of our trade secrets, or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights. Proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights in foreign countries could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, and could put our patents in these territories at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, or our patent applications at risk of not granting, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in all legal or other proceedings that we may initiate and, if we were to prevail, the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nIntellectual property rights do not address all potential threats to any competitive advantage we may have.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and intellectual property rights may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u00b7\nOthers may be able to make cellular treatments that are the same as or similar to our current or future product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed.\n\u00b7\nWe or any of our licensors or strategic partners might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed.\n\u00b7\nWe or any of our licensors or strategic partners might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions.\n\u00b7\nOthers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights.\n\u00b7\nThe prosecution of our pending patent applications may not result in granted patents.\n\u00b7\nGranted patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors.\n\u00b7\nPatent protection on our product candidates may expire before we are able to develop and commercialize the product, or before we are able to recover our investment in the product.\n\u00b7\nOur competitors might conduct research and development activities in the United States and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for such activities, as well as in countries in which we do not have patent rights, and may then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in markets where we intend to market our product candidates.\nIf we fail to meet our obligations under license agreements, we may lose our rights to key technologies on which our business depends.\nOur business will depend in part on several technologies that are based in part on technology licensed from third parties, including the Regents of the University of California, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. Those third-party license agreements impose obligations on us, including payment obligations and obligations to pursue development of commercial products under the licensed patents or technology. If a licensor believes that we have failed to meet our obligations under a license agreement, the licensor could seek to limit or terminate our license rights, which could lead to costly and time-consuming litigation and, potentially, a loss of the licensed rights. During the period of any such litigation our ability to carry out the development and commercialization of potential products, and our ability to raise capital, could be significantly and negatively affected. If our license rights were restricted or ultimately lost, we would not be able to continue to use the licensed technology in our business.\nThe price and sale of any of our products that receive regulatory approval may be limited by health insurance coverage and government regulation.\nSuccess in selling any of our products that receive regulatory approval may depend in part on the extent to which health insurance companies, HMOs, and government health administration authorities such as Medicare and Medicaid will pay for the cost of the products and related treatment. Until we actually introduce a new product into the medical market place we will not know with certainty whether adequate health insurance, HMO, and government coverage will be available to permit the product to be sold at a price high enough for us to generate a profit. In some foreign countries, pricing or profitability of health care products is subject to government control which may result in low prices for our products. In the United States, there have been a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar government controls, increased attention by Congress and others within the government regarding such proposals, and new proposals are likely to be made in the future.\nThere have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of federal legislative initiatives implemented to reform the U.S. healthcare system in ways that could adversely impact our business.\nThe FDA has established regulations, guidelines and policies to govern the drug development and approval process. Any change in regulatory requirements resulting from the adoption of new legislation, regulations or policies may require us to amend existing clinical trial protocols or add new clinical trials to comply with these changes. Such amendments to existing protocols or clinical trial applications or the need for new ones, may significantly and adversely affect the cost, timing and completion of the clinical trials for our drug candidates. In addition, the FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be issued that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates, or impose more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. The recent elections in the U.S. could result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and government policy that could significantly impact our business and the health care industry.\nIn addition, we expect that the Affordable Care Act, which we expect will be amended or repealed in the future, the 21st Century Cures Act, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to commercialize our future products and establish and maintain product sales. If we are slow or unable to adapt to any such changes, our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability would be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship With BioTime\nBioTime has a significant influence on our business operations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, BioTime owns approximately 46% of our issued and outstanding Common Stock. Because BioTime is by far our largest shareholder and owns close to a majority of the outstanding Common Stock, it has the voting power to significantly impact any matter that requires shareholder approval. Furthermore, three of the nine members of our Board of Directors are also directors of BioTime, and another director is an employee of Broadwood Capital, Inc., which is the general partner of Broadwood Partners, L.P., the partnership that is the largest shareholder of BioTime. Some of our directors also serve on the Boards of Directors of one or more of BioTime\u2019s other subsidiaries. As a result of the relationships described above, BioTime has significant influence over our business operations, and therefore, BioTime could cause corporate actions to be taken even if the interests of BioTime conflict with the interests of our other shareholders. This concentration of voting power could have the effect of deterring or preventing a change in control that might be beneficial to our other shareholders.\nWe partially rely upon BioTime for certain services and resources.\nAlthough we have our own research facilities, scientific personnel, and management and administrative personnel, we partially rely on BioTime to provide certain administrative services, including certain financial services related to financial accounting and reporting. We have entered into a Shared Facilities and Services Agreement with BioTime under which we have agreed to bear costs allocated to us by BioTime for the use of BioTime human resources and for services and materials provided for our benefit by BioTime. We pay BioTime 105% of its costs of providing personnel and services to us, and for any use of its facilities by us, including an allocation of general overhead based on that use. We may also share the services of some research personnel with BioTime. Conflicts of interest may arise from our relationship with BioTime.\nOur relationship with BioTime could give rise to certain conflicts of interest that could have an impact on our research and development programs, business opportunities, and operations generally.\nWe and BioTime or any of its other subsidiaries may determine to engage in research and development of the same or similar products or technologies, or products that would otherwise compete in the market place. Even if we utilize different technologies than BioTime or its other subsidiaries, we could find ourselves in competition with them for research scientists, financing and other resources, licensing, manufacturing, and distribution\nBecause of our relationship with BioTime as described in the prior risk factor, BioTime could prevent us from engaging in research and development programs, investments, business ventures, or agreements to develop, license, or acquire products or technologies that would or might compete with those owned, licensed, or under development by BioTime or any of its other subsidiaries.\nIn February 2016, we entered into a Cross-License with BioTime and a subsidiary of BioTime, ES Cell (\u201cESI\u201d). Under this Cross-License, we received a fully-paid, non-royalty-bearing, world-wide, non-exclusive, sub-licensable license under certain patents and related patent rights owned by BioTime and ESI, and in exchange, we granted BioTime and ESI a fully-paid, non-royalty-bearing, world-wide, non-exclusive, sub-licensable license certain patents and related patent rights we own. In the future, we may enter into additional license or sublicense agreements with BioTime or another BioTime subsidiary. Conflicts of interest could arise in determining the scope and financial terms of any such licenses or sublicenses, including the fields of use permitted, licensing fees, and royalties, if any, and other matters.\nBioTime and its other subsidiaries will engage for their own accounts in research and product development programs, investments, and business ventures and we will not be entitled to participate or to receive an interest in those programs, investments, or business ventures. BioTime and its other subsidiaries will not be obligated to present any particular research and development, investment, or business opportunity to us, even if the opportunity would be within the scope of our research and development plans or programs, business objectives, or investment policies. These opportunities may include, for example, opportunities to acquire businesses or assets, including but not limited to patents and other intellectual property that could be used by us or by BioTime or by any of BioTime\u2019s other subsidiaries. Our respective boards of directors will have to determine which company should pursue those opportunities, taking into account relevant facts and circumstances at the time, such as the financial and other resources of the companies available to acquire and utilize the opportunity, and the best \u201cfit\u201d between the opportunity and the business and research and development programs of the companies. However, by virtue of their significant voting power, BioTime has significant influence in decision making with respect to the allocation of opportunities.\nUnder the Cross-License, BioTime and ESI may have a conflict of interest in determining how and when they should enforce their rights under the Cross-License if they were to default or otherwise fail to perform any of their obligations under the Cross-License.\nOne of our significant assets is 3,852,880 BioTime common shares that we held as of December 31, 2016. We may sell the BioTime common shares from time to time, or to pledge those shares as collateral for loans, to raise capital to finance our operations. Because a sale of those shares could have a depressing effect on the market value of BioTime common shares, BioTime will have a continuing interest in the number of shares that we sell, the prices at which we sell the shares, and time and manner in which the shares are sold. Further, we may need or find it desirable to sell BioTime common shares at the same time as BioTime, or other BioTime subsidiaries that hold BioTime common shares, also desire to sell some of their BioTime common shares. Concurrent sales of BioTime common shares by us, BioTime, or other BioTime subsidiaries could have a depressing effect on the market price of the BioTime common shares, lowering the price at which we and they are able to sell BioTime common shares and resulting in lower net proceeds from the sales. We may coordinate any future sales of our BioTime common shares with BioTime and its other subsidiaries in order to provide an orderly and controlled process for raising capital through the sale of BioTime shares. This may include an agreement as to the number of shares to be sold, the time period or \u201cmarket window\u201d for selling shares, the use of a common securities broker-dealer, and a fair allocation of net sales based on average sales prices during any trading day on which we and they sell BioTime shares.\nEach conflict of interest will be resolved by our respective boards of directors in keeping with their fiduciary duties and such policies as they may implement from time to time.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe could lose our CIRM grant if we fail to meet the clinical trial milestones that are a condition to CIRM\u2019s obligation to provide funding.\nWe are depending upon our NGA from CIRM as a source of financing for the costs of conducting our SciStar Phase 1/2a clinical trial and process development of AST-OPC1. Under the terms of the NGA, as amended effective March 2, 2016, we must meet certain progress milestones pertaining to the clinical trial in order to receive additional payments. If we fail to meet the milestones, payments will be delayed. Additionally, under the NGACIRM has the right to suspend payment upon the occurrence of certain Suspension Events, which could force us to postpone, delay, or discontinue the clinical trial and development work for the product.\nEstablishing and maintaining strategic alliances is a key component of our business strategy. If we are unable to establish and maintain strategic alliances for our therapeutic product candidates, we may have to reduce or delay our product development or increase our expenditures.\nA key component of our current strategy for developing, manufacturing and commercializing our therapeutic product candidates will be entering into strategic alliances with pharmaceutical companies or other industry participants to advance our programs and enable us to maintain our financial and operational capacity. We will face significant competition in seeking appropriate alliances. We may not be able to negotiate alliances on acceptable terms, if at all. If our strategic alliances do not result in the successful development and commercialization of our product candidates or if one or more of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may not receive any future research and development funding or milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration. If we do not receive the funding we expect under these agreements, our continued development of our product candidates could be delayed and we may need to obtain additional funding, which may be unavailable or available only on unfavorable terms.\nIf we are able to enter into product development and marketing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies, we may license product development, manufacturing, and marketing rights to the pharmaceutical company or to a joint venture company formed with the pharmaceutical company. Under such arrangements we might receive only a royalty on sales of the products developed or an equity interest in a joint venture company that develops the product. As a result, our revenues from the sale of those products may be substantially less than the amount of revenues and gross profits that we might receive if we were to develop, manufacture, and market the products ourselves.\nWe may become dependent on possible future collaborations to develop and commercialize many of our product candidates and to provide the manufacturing, regulatory compliance, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities required for the success of our business.\nWe may enter into various kinds of collaborative research and development, manufacturing, and product marketing agreements to develop and commercialize our products. Any future milestone payments and cost reimbursements from collaboration agreements could provide an important source of financing for our research and development programs, thereby facilitating the application of our technology to the development and commercialization of our products, but there are risks associated with entering into collaboration arrangements.\nThere is a risk that we could become dependent upon one or more collaborative arrangements for product development or manufacturing or as a source of revenues from the sale of any products that may be developed by us alone or through one of the collaborative arrangements. A collaborative arrangement upon which we might depend might be terminated by our collaboration partner or they might determine not to actively pursue the development or commercialization of our products. A collaboration partner also may not be precluded from independently pursuing competing products and drug delivery approaches or technologies.\nThere is a risk that a collaboration partner might fail to perform its obligations under the collaborative arrangements or may be slow in performing its obligations. In addition, a collaboration partner may experience financial difficulties at any time that could prevent it from having available funds to contribute to the collaboration. If a collaboration partner fails to conduct its product development, manufacturing, commercialization, regulatory compliance, sales and marketing or distribution activities successfully and in a timely manner, or if it terminates or materially modifies its agreements with us, the development and commercialization of one or more product candidates could be delayed, curtailed or terminated because we may not have sufficient financial resources or capabilities to continue product development, manufacturing, and commercialization on our own.\nIndustry and other market data used in our SEC filings, including market data undertaken by us or our engaged consultants, may prove to be unrepresentative of current and future market conditions or future results.\nOur SEC filings include statistical and other industry and market data that we obtained from industry publications and research, surveys and studies conducted by third parties, and surveys and studies we commissioned, regarding the market potential for our product candidates. Although we believe that such information has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, neither the sources of such data, nor we, can guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information. While we believe these industry publications and third party research, surveys and studies are reliable, we have not independently verified such data. With respect to the information from third party consultants, the results of that study represent the independent consultants\u2019 own methodologies, assumptions, research, analysis, projections, estimations, composition of respondent pool, presentation of data, and adjustments, each of which may ultimately prove to be incorrect, and cause actual results and market viability to differ materially from those presented in such report. Readers should not place undue reliance on this information.\nRisks Pertaining to Our Common Stock\nOwnership of our common stock will entail certain risks associated with the volatility of prices for our shares and the fact that we do not pay dividends on our common stock.\nThe price of our common stock may rise and fall rapidly.\nThe market price of our common stock like that of the shares of many biotechnology companies is highly volatile. The price of our common stock may rise or fall rapidly as a result of a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nsales or potential sales of substantial amounts of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nresults of preclinical testing or clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nannouncements about us or about our competitors, including clinical trial results, regulatory approvals, new product introductions and commercial results;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of our development programs;\n\u00b7\nthe success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u00b7\nlitigation and other developments relating to our issued patents or patent applications or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nconditions in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us, including the failure of our earnings to meet analysts\u2019 expectations; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. The stock markets in general, and the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies in particular, have been experiencing extreme price and volume fluctuations which have affected the market price of the equity securities without regard to the operating performance of the issuing companies. Broad market fluctuations, as well as industry factors and general economic and political conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe JOBS Act allows us to postpone the date by which we must comply with certain laws and regulations intended to protect investors and to reduce the amount of information we provide in our reports filed with the Commission, which could undermine investor confidence in our company and adversely affect the market price of our securities.\nThe JOBS Act is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d As defined in the JOBS Act, a public company whose initial public offering of common equity securities occurred after December 8, 2011 and whose annual gross revenues are less than $1.0 billion will, in general, qualify as an emerging growth company. Under this definition, we are an emerging growth company and could remain an emerging growth company until as late as December 31, 2019. The JOBS Act provides that, so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we will, among other things:\n\u00b7\nbe exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u00b7\nbe exempt from the \u201csay on pay\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding stockholder vote to approve compensation of certain executive officers) and the \u201csay on golden parachute\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding stockholder vote to approve golden parachute arrangements for certain executive officers in connection with mergers and certain other business combinations) of the Dodd-Frank Act and certain disclosure requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to compensation of our named executive officers;\n\u00b7\nbe permitted to omit the detailed compensation discussion and analysis from proxy statements and reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and instead provide a reduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation; and\n\u00b7\nbe exempt from any rules that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report on the financial statements.\nWe currently take advantage of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are available to us so long as we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d except that (i) we currently hold say on pay advisory votes at required intervals, (ii) we currently elect to obtain an attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (iii) we have irrevocably elected not to take advantage of the extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards available under Section 102(b) of the JOBS Act. Among other things, this means that our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected. Likewise, so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we may elect not to provide you with certain information, including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of our named executive officers, that we would otherwise have been required to provide in filings we make with the Commission, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate our company. As a result, investor confidence in our company and the market price of our securities may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur stock price could decline due to the large number of outstanding shares of our common stock eligible for future sale.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock could also make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on any of our classes of securities and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on the appreciation in the price of our securities.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on any class of our securities. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund our future growth and do not expect to declare or pay any dividend on any class of our securities in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only realize a gain on your investment in our securities if the market price of our securities appreciates and you sell your securities at a price above your cost after accounting for any taxes. The price of our securities may not appreciate in value or ever exceed the price that you paid for our securities.\nThe price of our common stock, and the value of our assets, will be affected by changes in the value of the BioTime common shares that we own.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we held 3,852,880 BioTime common shares. The value of our common stock will reflect, in part, the value of the BioTime common shares that we hold. The value of the BioTime common shares we hold will vary with the price at which BioTime common shares trade in the public market. The market price of BioTime common shares will be impacted by a number of factors, including the results of BioTime\u2019s operations.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our securities could decline.\nThe current trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us, our business, our markets and our competitors. We do not control these analysts. If securities analysts do not cover us, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary about us or our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the market and interest in our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe implementation of a new FASB accounting standard could increase the risk that our future financial statements could be qualified by going concern uncertainty.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, \u201cPresentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\u201d ASU No. 2014-15 defines management's responsibility to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU No. 2014-15 is effective for us for the year ended December 31, 2016, and all annual and interim periods thereafter. In connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, ASU No. 2014-15 requires that an entity\u2019s management evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). As a result of the implementation of ASU No. 2014-15, we will be required to have more cash, cash equivalents, and liquid investments on hand on the date we issue or file our financial statements than had been the case during prior years in order to avoid a going concern qualification in our auditor\u2019s report and in the footnotes to our financial statements. If our financial statements were to become subject to a going concern qualification or uncertainty or if we are unable to alleviate substantial doubt as part of our going concern assessment, or both, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nBioTime and OncoCyte will also be impacted by ASU No. 2014-15 in much the same manner as us. If the financial statements of BioTime, or OncoCyte, or both, were to become subject to a going concern qualification or uncertainty, the market price of their common stock could decline, resulting in a loss or decline in value of the BioTime shares we own, the OncoCyte shares we own, or both, as available-for-sale equity securities at fair value.\nYou may experience dilution of your ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock and our preferred stock.\nIn the future, we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present shareholders. We may issue additional shares of Common Stock or other securities in order to raise additional capital, or in connection with hiring or retaining employees or consultants, or in connection with future acquisitions of licenses to technology or rights to acquire products, in connection with future business acquisitions, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional shares of common stock or other securities may create downward pressure on the trading price of our Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 14950, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "AST"}
