{"cik": "1142596", "company": "NUVASIVE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and that could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are set forth below and elsewhere in this report. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Under these circumstances, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, operations, liquidity and stock price materially and adversely. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this report before you decide to invest in our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nTo be commercially successful, we must effectively demonstrate to spine surgeons the value proposition of our products and procedural solutions compared to those of our competitors.\nWe focus on marketing our products and procedural solutions to spine surgeons, because of the role that they play in determining the course of patient treatment. We believe spine surgeons will not widely adopt our products and procedural solutions unless we are able to effectively educate and train them as to the distinctive characteristics, perceived benefits, safety and cost-effectiveness of our offerings as compared to those of our competitors. Surgeons may be hesitant to use our products and procedural solutions for the following reasons, among others:\n\u2022\nlack of surgeon experience with minimally-disruptive surgical products and procedures;\n\u2022\nlack or perceived lack of evidence supporting additional patient benefits;\n\u2022\nperceived liability risks generally associated with the use of new products and procedures;\n\u2022\nexisting relationships with competitors and distributors;\n\u2022\nlimited or lack of availability of coverage and reimbursement within healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022\nincreased competition in lateral procedural offerings;\n\u2022\nlack or perceived lack of differentiation among lateral procedures;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with the purchase of new products and equipment; and\n\u2022\nthe time commitment that may be required for training.\nIf we are not able to effectively demonstrate to spine surgeons the value proposition of our products and procedural solutions, or if spine surgeons adopt competing products into their practice, our sales could significantly decrease or fail to increase, which could adversely impact our profitability and cash flow. In addition, we believe recommendations and support of our offerings by influential spine surgeons and other key opinion leaders are essential for market acceptance and adoption. If we are not successful in obtaining such support, surgeons may not use our products and procedural solutions, and we may not achieve expected sales or profitability.\nOur future success depends on our strategy of obsoleting our products and our ability to timely acquire, develop and introduce new products or product enhancements that will be accepted by the market.\nAn important part of our business strategy is to stay ahead of our competitors by obsoleting our current offerings with new and enhanced products and technologies. As such, our success will depend in part on our ability to acquire, develop and introduce new products and enhancements to our existing products to keep pace with changes in technology and market demand, as well as physician, hospital and healthcare provider practices. The success of any new product offering or enhancement to an existing product will depend on numerous factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nproperly identify and anticipate surgeon and patient needs;\n\u2022\ndevelop and introduce new products or product enhancements in a timely and cost-effective manner;\n\u2022\nadequately protect our intellectual property and avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties;\n\u2022\ndemonstrate the safety and efficacy of new products through the conduct of clinical investigations or the collection of existing relevant clinical data; and\n\u2022\nobtain the necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for new products or product enhancements.\nIn addition, our research and development efforts may require a substantial investment of time and resources before we are adequately able to determine the commercial viability of a new product, technology, or other innovation. Even if we are able to develop enhancements or new generation products successfully, these enhancements or new generation products may not generate sufficient demand or produce sales in excess of the costs of development, which would cause our results of operations to suffer. It is also important that we carefully manage our introduction of new and enhanced products. If potential customers delay purchases until new or enhanced products are available, it could negatively impact our sales. In addition, to the extent we have excess or obsolete inventory as we transition to new products, it would result in margin reducing write-offs for obsolete inventory, and our results of operations may suffer.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market segment that is subject to rapid change, and if we are unable to compete successfully, our sales and operating results may suffer.\nThe market for spine surgery products and procedures is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products that reach the market in a timely manner, receive adequate reimbursement and are safer, less invasive and less expensive than those of our competitors. With respect to our nerve monitoring systems, we compete with Medtronic and Vyaire Medical (formerly VIASYS Healthcare, a division of Becton, Dickinson and Company), each of which have significantly greater resources than we do. Our IOM services business competes with Specialty Care and numerous smaller and regional nerve monitoring companies. With respect to MaXcess, our minimally-disruptive surgical system, our largest competitors are Medtronic, DePuy/Synthes, Stryker Spine, Globus Medical, and Zimmer Biomet Spine. We compete with many of the same companies with respect to our other products. We also compete with numerous smaller companies with respect to our implant products, many of whom have a significant regional market presence. At any time, these companies and other potential market entrants may develop alternative treatments, products or procedures for the treatment of spine disorders that compete directly or indirectly with our offerings. In addition, they may gain a market advantage by developing and patenting competitive products or processes earlier than we can or by obtaining regulatory clearances or market registrations more rapidly than we can.\nMany of our competitors have greater resources than we have.\nMany of our larger competitors are either publicly traded or divisions or subsidiaries of publicly traded companies, and enjoy several competitive advantages over us, including:\n\u2022\nsignificantly greater name recognition;\n\u2022\nestablished relationships with a greater number of spine surgeons, hospitals, other healthcare providers and third-party payers;\n\u2022\nlarger and more well-established distribution networks domestically and/or internationally;\n\u2022\nproducts supported by long-term clinical data;\n\u2022\ngreater experience in obtaining and maintaining FDA and other regulatory approvals or clearances for products and product enhancements;\n\u2022\nmore expansive portfolios of intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\ngreater financial assets, cash flow, capital markets access and other resources for product research and development, sales and marketing, and litigation.\nBecause of the significant size of the potential market for spine surgery products and procedures, we anticipate that existing competitors will continue to dedicate substantial resources to developing competing products. If we are unable to compete effectively, our sales and operating results may suffer.\nChanges to third-party reimbursement policies and practices, including non-coverage decisions, can negatively impact our ability to sell our products and services.\nSales of our products and procedural solutions depend on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third-party payers. We believe that future third-party reimbursement for healthcare costs may be subject to changes in policies and practices, such as more restrictive criteria to qualify for surgery coverage or reduction in payment amounts to hospitals and surgeons for approved surgery and IOM services, both in the United States and internationally. Further, certain third-party payers have stated non-coverage decisions concerning our technologies and services. These actions could significantly alter our ability to sell our products and procedural solutions. The continuing efforts of governmental authorities, insurance companies, and other payers of healthcare costs to contain or reduce costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these third-party payers. Changes in legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payers may adversely affect the demand for our products and services as healthcare providers generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures performed with these devices and services. Likewise, spine surgeons, neurophysiologists and their supervising physicians rely primarily on third-party reimbursement for the surgical or monitoring fees they earn. Spine surgeons are unlikely to use our products and services if they do not receive reimbursement adequate to cover the cost of their involvement in surgical procedures.\nPricing pressure from our competitors, hospital customers and insurance providers can negatively impact our ability to sell our products and services.\nThe market for spine surgery products is large and has attracted numerous new companies and technologies. As some companies have sought to compete based on price, it has created pricing pressure, which we expect to continue in the future. In addition, we may experience decreasing prices for our products due to pricing pressure from our hospital customers and insurance providers. Because healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade, numerous initiatives and reforms have resulted in efforts to drive down prices. As hospitals look to reduce costs, including by aggregating purchasing decisions and through industry consolidation, they may demand lower pricing and limit their number of suppliers. If competitive forces drive down the prices we are able to charge for our products, our profit margins will shrink, which will adversely affect our ability to maintain our profitability and to invest in and grow our business.\nThe proliferation of physician-owned distributorships, as well as aggressive competitive tactics to attract away key customers, could result in increased pricing pressure and harm our ability to maintain or grow revenue.\nPhysician-owned distributorships, or PODs, are medical device distributors that are owned, directly or indirectly, by physicians. These physicians derive revenue from selling or arranging for the sale of medical devices via their PODs that are used in the procedures they perform on their patients. We do not sell or distribute any of our products to PODs. However, the proliferation of PODs may reduce our market opportunities and may hamper our ability to grow or maintain revenue. PODs can have significant market knowledge and access to the surgeons who use our products, and we have seen increasingly aggressive competitive tactics from PODs focused on attracting customers away from us. To the extent these tactics are successful, our revenue may materially suffer.\nIf the quality of our products does not meet the expectations of physicians or patients, then our brand and reputation could suffer and our business could be adversely impacted.\nIn the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues that may arise with our products, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. Although we have established internal procedures to minimize risks that may arise from quality issues, we may not be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. If the quality of our products does not meet the expectations of physicians or patients, then our brand and reputation could suffer and our business could be adversely impacted.\nThe safety of many of our products is not yet supported by long-term clinical data and many of our products may therefore prove to be less safe and effective than initially thought.\nAs a consequence of our strategy to obsolete our own products with new technologies, many of our products do not have a long history of use. Further, many of our products are subject to the FDA\u2019s 510(k) premarket notification clearance process, which typically does not require clinical data. Accordingly, many of our products currently lack the breadth of published long-term clinical data supporting their safety and effectiveness. For these reasons, spine surgeons may be slow to adopt our products, we may not have comparative data that our competitors have or are generating, and we may be subject to greater regulatory and product liability risks.\nFurther, future patient studies or clinical experience may indicate that treatment with our products does not improve patient outcomes. Such results would reduce demand for our products, affect sustainable reimbursement from third-party payers, significantly reduce our ability to achieve expected revenue and could prevent us from sustaining or increasing profitability. Moreover, if future results and experience indicate that our products cause unexpected or serious complications or other unforeseen negative effects, we could be subject to significant legal liability and harm to our business reputation. The spine medical device market has been particularly prone to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the testing, manufacture and sale of medical devices and products for spine surgery procedures.\nWe may engage in strategic transactions, including acquisitions, investments, or joint development agreements that may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may pursue transactions, including acquisitions of complementary businesses, technology licensing arrangements and joint development agreements to expand our product offerings and geographic presence as part of our business strategy, which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. We may not complete transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the expected benefits of any acquisition, license arrangement or joint development agreement. Other companies may compete with us for these strategic opportunities. We also could experience negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition from acquisition-related charges, amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges, and other issues that could arise in connection with, or as a result of, the acquisition of an acquired company or business, including issues related to internal control over financial reporting, regulatory or compliance issues and potential adverse short-term effects on results of operations through increased costs or otherwise.\nIn February 2016, we completed the acquisition of Ellipse Technologies for an upfront payment of $380.0 million and a potential milestone payment of $30.0 million payable in 2017 related to the achievement of specific revenue targets. In July 2016, we acquired BNN Holdings Corp., which through its subsidiaries and affiliates, owns and operates Biotronic NeuroNetwork for a purchase price of $98.0 million. Acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Ellipse Technologies and Biotronic NeuroNetwork, involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in finding suitable partners or acquisition candidates;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in obtaining financing on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in completing transactions on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we will pay more than the value we derive from the acquisition, which could result in future non-cash impairment charges and/or a dilution of future earnings per share;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integration of the operations, technologies, personnel, and products of the acquired companies, which may require significant attention of the Company\u2019s management team that otherwise would be available for the ongoing development of our business;\n\u2022\nthe applicability of additional laws, regulations and policies that have particular application to our acquisitions, including those relating to patient privacy, insurance fraud and abuse, false claims, prohibitions against self-referrals, anti-kickbacks, direct billing practices, HIPAA compliance, and prohibitions against the corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of certain known and unknown liabilities of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or future write-offs of intangible assets or goodwill;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in retaining key relationships with employees, customers, partners and suppliers of the acquired company; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in operating in different business markets where we may not have historical experience.\nAny of these factors could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations or financial position. Further, past and potential acquisitions entail risks, uncertainties and potential disruptions to our business, especially where we have limited experience as a company developing or marketing a particular product or technology. In addition, we may face additional risks related to foreign acquisitions. Foreign acquisitions involve unique risks in addition to those mentioned above, including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages, currency risks and the particular economic, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.\nHealthcare policy changes, including United States healthcare reform legislation signed in 2010, may have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted in the United States, which made a number of substantial changes in the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act:\n\u2022\nrequires certain medical device manufacturers to pay a sales tax equal to 2.3% of the price for which such manufacturer sells its medical devices, provided that such tax, after going into effect in 2013, has now been suspended until 2018;\n\u2022\nestablishes a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee and identify priorities in comparative clinical effectiveness research in an effort to coordinate and develop such research;\n\u2022\nimplements payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models; and\n\u2022\nestablishes an Independent Payment Advisory Board that will submit recommendations to reduce Medicare spending if projected Medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nWe expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.\nOur IOM business exposes us to risks inherent with the sale of services.\nOur IOM services and support business operated though our subsidiary, NuVasive Clinical Services, exposes us to different risks than our other products and technologies. Through our IOM services business, we provide onsite and remote monitoring of the neurological systems of patients undergoing spinal and brain-related surgeries. Our neurophysiologists are present in the operating room during procedures and work in partnership with supervising physicians who remotely oversee and interpret neurophysiological data gathered via broadband transmission over the Internet. Providing this service subjects us to malpractice exposure. In addition, given the reliance on technology, any disruption to our neuromonitoring equipment or the Internet could harm our service operations and our reputation among our customers. Further, any disruption to our computer systems could adversely impact the performance of our neurophysiologists.\nIn addition, IOM services are directly billed to Medicare and commercial payers, which brings with it additional risks associated with proper billing practice regulations, HIPAA compliance, corporate practice of medicine laws, and new collections risk associated with third-party payers. Due to the breadth of many healthcare laws and regulations, our IOM business could also be subject to healthcare fraud regulation and enforcement by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business, including under the Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal false claims laws and state law equivalents. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described in the previous sentence or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nOur employee shareowners, consultants, distributors and other commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employee shareowners, consultants, distributors and other commercial partners may engage in fraudulent or illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless or negligent conduct or other unauthorized activities that violate the regulations of the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such regulators, manufacturing standards, healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad or laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry, including the sale of medical devices, are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees, sales agencies, distributors and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could result in the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Whether or not we are successful in defending against such actions or investigations, we could incur substantial costs, including legal fees, and divert the attention of management in defending ourselves against any of these claims or investigations.\nRisks Related to our Commercial Operations and Plans for Future Growth\nIf we are unable to maintain and expand our network of direct and independent sales representatives, we may not be able to generate anticipated sales.\nIn the United States, we sell our products through a combination of exclusive independent sales agents and directly-employed sales personnel. Our international sales force is comprised of independent sales agents, directly-employed sales personnel, as well as exclusive and non-exclusive independent third-party distributors. We expect these sales representatives to develop long-lasting relationships with the spine surgeons they serve. If our sales representatives fail to adequately promote, market and sell our products, or fail to develop lasting relationships with spine surgeons, our sales could significantly decrease or fail to increase. Further, we may terminate sales representatives from time to time, which could subject us to claims and lawsuits. Asserting or defending against these types of claims and lawsuits may result in significant legal fees and expenses, and if we are unsuccessful, we could be liable for damages.\nWe face significant challenges and risks in managing our geographically dispersed distribution network and retaining the individuals who make up that network. In the past, we have experienced departures of sales representatives, which have had a negative impact on our results. If sales representatives were to depart and be retained by one of our competitors, we may be unable to prevent them from helping competitors solicit business from our existing customers, which could further adversely affect our sales. Because of the intense competition for their services, we may be unable to recruit or retain sales representatives to work with us. Failure to hire or retain qualified sales representatives would prevent us from expanding our business and generating sales.\nWe may be unable to manage our future growth effectively, which could make it difficult to execute our business strategy.\nWe intend to grow our business operations and we may experience periods of rapid growth and expansion. This anticipated future growth could create a strain on our organizational, administrative and operational infrastructure, including manufacturing operations, quality control, technical support and customer service, sales force management and general and financial administration. We may not be able to maintain the quality or delivery timelines of our products or satisfy customer demand as it grows. Our ability to manage our growth properly will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, as well as our reporting systems and procedures.\nIf our commercial operations and sales volume grow, we will need to continue to increase our workflow capacity for manufacturing, customer service, billing and general process improvements and expand our internal quality assurance program, among other things. We will also need to purchase additional equipment, some of which can take several months or more to procure, set up and validate, and increase our manufacturing, maintenance, software and computing capacity to meet increased demand. These increases in scale, expansion of personnel, purchase of equipment or process enhancements may not be successfully implemented.\nOur reliance on a limited number of suppliers and manufacturers could limit our ability to meet demand for our products in a timely manner or within our budget.\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers and manufacturers to supply and manufacture a majority of our products, and we may not be able to find replacements or immediately transition to alternative suppliers. Many of our key products are manufactured at single locations, with limited alternate facilities. Further, for reasons of quality assurance or cost effectiveness, we purchase certain components and raw materials from sole suppliers.\nTo be successful, we rely on our suppliers to provide us with products and components in substantial quantities, in compliance with regulatory requirements, in accordance with agreed upon specifications, at acceptable cost and on a timely basis. In the event we experience delays, shortages, or stoppages of supply with any supplier, we would be forced to identify a suitable alternative supplier which could take significant time and result in significant expense. In addition, our anticipated growth could strain the ability of suppliers to deliver an increasingly large supply of products, materials and components. If we are required to transition to new third-party suppliers for certain components of our products, the use of components or materials furnished by these alternative suppliers could require us to alter our operations. Any such interruption or alteration could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we are required to change the manufacturer of a critical component of our products, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities, procedures and operations that comply with our quality and applicable regulatory requirements, which could further impede our ability to manufacture our products in a timely manner. Transitioning to a new supplier could be time-consuming and expensive, may result in interruptions in our operations and product delivery, could affect the performance specifications of our products or could require that we modify the design of those systems.\nPerformance issues, service interruptions or price increases by our shipping carriers could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation and ability to provide our services on a timely basis.\nExpedited, reliable shipping is essential to our operations. We rely heavily on providers of transport services for reliable and secure point-to-point transport of our products to our customers and for tracking of these shipments. Should a carrier encounter delivery performance issues such as loss, damage or destruction of any products, it could be costly to replace such products in a timely manner and such occurrences may damage our reputation and lead to decreased demand for our products and increased cost and expense to our business. In addition, any significant increase in shipping rates could adversely affect our operating margins and results of operations. Similarly, strikes, severe weather, natural disasters or other service interruptions affecting delivery services we use would adversely affect our ability to process orders for our products on a timely basis.\nManufacturing risks may adversely affect our ability to manufacture products and could reduce our gross margins and negatively affect our operating results.\nWe currently manufacture a portion of our products at our manufacturing facility in Dayton, Ohio. In 2015, we added an approximately 180,000 square foot manufacturing facility in West Carrollton, Ohio, in order to expand our internal manufacturing efforts and this new facility commenced limited commercial scale production in the fourth quarter of 2016. As part of our business strategy, we intend to expand our ability to manufacture our current and new products with exceptional quality and in sufficient quantities to meet demand, while complying with regulatory requirements and managing manufacturing costs. We are subject to numerous risks relating to our manufacturing capabilities, including both those of our own manufacturing facilities and those of our third party suppliers, such as:\n\u2022\nproblems with quality control and assurance;\n\u2022\ndefects in product components that we source from third-party suppliers;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining components from third-party suppliers and component supply shortages;\n\u2022\nfailing to predict demand accurately, resulting in a failure to increase production of products to meet demand;\n\u2022\npotential adverse effects on existing business relationships with current third-party suppliers as we expand our in-house manufacturing capabilities;\n\u2022\nmaintaining control over manufacturing expenses as production expands;\n\u2022\ndifficulties associated with compliance with local, state, federal and foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe inability to modify production lines to enable the efficient manufacture of new products or to quickly implement changes to current products in response to regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\npotential damage to or destruction of our, or our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing equipment or manufacturing facilities.\nThese risks may be exacerbated by our limited experience with in-house manufacturing processes and procedures. In addition, as we seek to expand our manufacturing capabilities, we will have to continue to invest additional resources to hire and train personnel and enhance our production processes. If we fail to increase our manufacturing capacity efficiently, our profit margins will shrink, which will negatively affect our operating results.\nThe loss of key employee shareowners, or our inability to recruit, hire and retain skilled and experienced personnel, could negatively impact our ability to effectively manage and expand our business.\nOur success depends on the skills, experience and performance of the members of our executive management team and other key employee shareowners. Their individual and collective efforts will be important as we continue to develop our products and as we expand our commercial activities. The loss or incapacity of existing members of our executive management team could negatively impact our operations, particularly if we experience difficulties in hiring qualified successors. We do not maintain key man life insurance with respect to any of our employee shareowners.\nOur research and development programs and operations depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled engineers and technicians. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified managers, engineers and technicians in the future due to the competition for qualified personnel among medical device businesses, particularly in California. We also face competition from universities and public and private research institutions in recruiting and retaining highly qualified personnel. Recruiting and retention difficulties can limit our ability to support our commercial, manufacturing and research and development programs. All of our U.S. employee shareowners are employed on an at-will basis, which means that either we or the employee shareowner may terminate his or her employment at any time. The loss of key employee shareowners, the failure of any key employee shareowners to perform or our inability to attract and retain skilled employee shareowners, as needed, or an inability to effectively plan for and implement a succession plan for key employee shareowners could harm our business.\nWe face risks associated with our international business.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, $130.4 million or approximately 14% of our net revenue was attributable to our international customers. We are seeking to increase our international sales over the foreseeable future. Our international business operations are subject to a variety of risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign and geographically dispersed operations;\n\u2022\nhaving to comply with various U.S. and international laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or the FCPA, and anti-money laundering laws;\n\u2022\nhaving to comply with export control laws, including, but not limited to, the Export Administration Regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the Department of the Treasury, as well as the laws and regulations administered by the Department of Commerce;\n\u2022\ndiffering regulatory requirements for obtaining clearances or approvals to market our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in, or uncertainties relating to, foreign rules and regulations that may impact our ability to sell our products, perform services or repatriate profits to the United States;\n\u2022\ntariffs and trade barriers, export regulations and other regulatory and contractual limitations on our ability to sell our products in certain foreign markets;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nlimitations on or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries or joint ventures;\n\u2022\ndiffering multiple payer reimbursement regimes, government payers or patient self-pay systems;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor laws and standards;\n\u2022\ncomplex data privacy requirements;\n\u2022\neconomic, political or social instability in foreign countries and regions;\n\u2022\nan inability, or reduced ability, to protect our intellectual property, including any effect of compulsory licensing imposed by government action; and\n\u2022\navailability of government subsidies or other incentives that benefit competitors in their local markets that are not available to us.\nThe FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments. Because of the predominance of government-sponsored healthcare systems around the world, many of our customer relationships outside of the United States are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. Our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employee shareowners, distributors or agents. In recent years, both the United States and foreign government regulators have increased regulation, enforcement, inspections and governmental investigations of the medical device industry, including increased United States government oversight and enforcement of the FCPA. Despite implementation of a comprehensive global healthcare compliance program, we may be subject to more regulation, enforcement, inspections and investigations by governmental authorities in the future.\nAny failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations in the United States or abroad could adversely affect us in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments and restrictions on certain business activities, disgorgement and other remedial measures, disruptions of our operations, significant management distraction. Also, the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our distribution and sales activities. Any reduction in international sales, or our failure to further develop our international markets, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results may be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nAs we increasingly compete in markets outside of the United States, we are and will be exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to our foreign operations. A significant portion of our foreign subsidiaries\u2019 operating expenses are incurred in foreign currencies. If the U.S. dollar weakens, our consolidated operating expenses would increase. An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could require us to reduce our selling price or risk making our products less competitive in international markets or our costs could increase. Also, if our international sales increase, we may enter into a greater number of transactions denominated in non-U.S. dollars, which could expose us to foreign currency risks, including changes in currency exchange rates. If we are unable to address these risks and challenges effectively, our international operations may not be successful and our business could be harmed.\nIf we fail to properly manage our anticipated international growth, our business could suffer.\nWe have invested, and expect to increase our investment for the foreseeable future, in our expansion into international markets. To execute our anticipated growth in international markets we must:\n\u2022\nmanage the complexities associated with a larger, faster growing and more geographically diverse organization;\n\u2022\nexpand our clinical development resources to manage and execute increasingly global, larger and more complex clinical trials;\n\u2022\nmanage our directly-employed sales personnel as well as independent distributors and sales agents operating in international markets often pursuant to laws, regulations and customs that may be different than those that are customary for our United States operations;\n\u2022\nexpand our sales and marketing presence in international markets generally to avoid revenue concentration in a small number of markets that would subject us to the risk of business disruption as a result of economic or political problems in concentrated locations;\n\u2022\nupgrade our internal business processes and capabilities (e.g., information technology platform and systems, product distribution and tracking) to create scalability and properly handle the transaction volumes that our growing geographically diverse organization demands; and\n\u2022\nexpend time and resources to receive product approvals and clearances to sell and promote products.\nWe expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase as we continue to expand into international markets. International markets may be slower than domestic markets in adopting our products and are expected, in many instances, to yield lower profit margins when compared to our domestic operations. We have only limited experience in expanding into international markets as well as marketing and operating our products and services in such markets.\nAdditionally, our international endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of Company management from domestic operations, insufficient revenue to offset the expenses associated with our international strategy, and issues not discovered in our due diligence of new markets or ventures. Because expansion into international markets is inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Even if our international expansion is successful, our expenses may increase at a greater pace than our revenue and our operating results could be harmed.\nFurther, our anticipated growth internationally will place additional strain on our suppliers and manufacturers, resulting in increased need for us to carefully monitor quality assurance. Any failure by us to manage our international growth effectively could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals.\nCyber security risks and the failure to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our computer hardware, software, and Internet applications and related tools and functions could result in harm to our business and/or subject us to costs, fines or lawsuits.\nWe rely on sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure to operate and manage our business. We also maintain personally identifiable information (PII) about our employee shareowners, and given the nature of our business, we have access to PHI. Our business therefore depends on the continuous, effective, reliable, and secure operation of our computer hardware, software, networks, Internet servers, and related infrastructure. To the extent that our hardware or software malfunctions or access to our data by internal personnel, suppliers or customers through the Internet is interrupted or compromised, our business could suffer.\nThe integrity and protection of our customer, personnel, financial, research and development, and other confidential data is critical to our business and our customers and employees have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment governing information, security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. Although our computer and communications hardware is protected through physical and software safeguards, it is still vulnerable to system malfunction, computer viruses, and cyber-attacks. These events could lead to the unauthorized access of our information technology systems and result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us, our employee shareowners, partners, customers, or our suppliers. The techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world. As a result, we may not be able to address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures. If our information technology systems are compromised, we could be subject to fines, damages, litigation and enforcement actions and we could lose trade secrets or other confidential information, the occurrence of which could harm our business.\nOur operations are vulnerable to interruption or loss due to natural or other disasters, power loss, strikes and other events beyond our control.\nWe conduct a significant portion of our activities, including administration and data processing, at facilities located in Southern California, an area that has experienced major earthquakes, fires and other natural disasters. A major earthquake, fire or other disaster (such as a major flood, tsunami, or terrorist attack) affecting our facilities, or those of our suppliers, could significantly disrupt our operations, and delay or prevent product shipment or installation during the time required to repair, rebuild or replace our facilities or those of our suppliers. These delays could be lengthy and costly. If any of our customers\u2019 facilities are negatively impacted by a disaster, shipments of our products could be delayed. Additionally, customers may delay purchases of our products until operations return to normal. Even if we are able to quickly respond to a disaster, the ongoing effects of the disaster could create some uncertainty in the operations of our business. In addition, our facilities may be subject to a shortage of available electrical power and other energy supplies. Any shortages may increase our costs for power and energy supplies or could result in blackouts, which could disrupt the operations of our affected facilities and harm our business. In addition, concerns about terrorism, the effects of a terrorist attack, political turmoil or an outbreak of epidemic diseases could have a negative effect on our operations, those of our suppliers and customers and the ability to travel, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur insurance policies are expensive and protect us only from some business risks, which will leave us exposed to significant uninsured liabilities.\nWe do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. Some of the policies we currently maintain include general liability, foreign liability, employee benefits liability, property, umbrella, workers\u2019 compensation, products liability and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance. We do not know, however, if we will be able to maintain existing insurance with adequate levels of coverage. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our cash position and results of operations.\nWe bear the risk of warranty claims on our products.\nWe bear the risk of express and implied warranty claims on products we supply, including equipment and component parts manufactured by third parties. We may not be successful in claiming recovery under any warranty or indemnity provided to us by our suppliers or vendors in the event of a successful warranty claim against us by a customer or that any recovery from such vendor or supplier would be adequate. In addition, warranty claims brought by our customers related to third-party components may arise after our ability to bring corresponding warranty claims against such suppliers expire, which could result in additional costs to us. There is a risk that warranty claims made against us will exceed our warranty reserve and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Litigation and Intellectual Property\nDefending against litigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend significant time and money, and if we are unsuccessful, we may be obligated to pay damages and halt sales of our products.\nSignificant litigation regarding patent rights occurs in our industry and our commercial success depends in part on not infringing the patents or violating the other proprietary rights of others. We have received in the past, and expect to receive in the future, claims from our competitors alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights as part of business strategies designed to impede our successful commercialization of updated and new products and entry into new markets. A patent infringement suit brought against us or any of our strategic partners or licensees may force us or such strategic partners or licensees to stop or delay developing, manufacturing or selling potential products that are claimed to infringe a third-party\u2019s intellectual property, unless that party grants us or our strategic partners or licensees rights to use its intellectual property. In such cases, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others in order to continue to commercialize our products. However, we may not be able to obtain any licenses required under any patents or proprietary rights of third parties on acceptable terms, or at all, and any licenses may require substantial royalties or other payments by us. Even if our strategic partners, licensees or we were able to obtain rights to the third-party\u2019s intellectual property, these rights may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we may be unable to commercialize some of our potential products or may have to cease some of our business operations as a result of patent infringement claims, which could severely harm our business.\nMoreover, we may become party to future adversarial proceedings regarding our patent portfolio or the patents of third parties. Such proceedings could include supplemental examination or contested post-grant proceedings such as inter partes review, reexamination, interference or derivation proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and challenges in U.S. District Court. Patents may be subjected to opposition, post-grant review or comparable proceedings lodged in various foreign, both national and regional, patent offices. The legal threshold for initiating litigation or contested proceedings may be low, so that even lawsuits or proceedings with a low probability of success might be initiated. Litigation and contested proceedings can also be expensive and time-consuming, and our adversaries in these proceedings may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to prosecuting these legal actions than we can.\nAny lawsuits resulting from such allegations could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidate our proprietary rights. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nstop making, selling or using products or technologies that allegedly infringe the asserted intellectual property;\n\u2022\nlose the opportunity to license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our intellectual property rights against others;\n\u2022\nincur significant legal expenses;\n\u2022\npay substantial damages or royalties to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing;\n\u2022\npay the attorney\u2019s fees and costs of litigation to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing;\n\u2022\nredesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property, which could be costly, disruptive and/or infeasible; or\n\u2022\nattempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property from third parties, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nAny litigation or claim against us, even those without merit, may cause us to incur substantial costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our core business and harm our reputation. In addition, we generally indemnify our customers and international distributors with respect to infringement by our products of the proprietary rights of third parties. If third parties assert infringement claims against our customers or distributors, we may be required to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers or distributors, regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed or settle, we may be forced to pay damages or settlement payments on behalf of our customers or distributors or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use. If we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our customers may be forced to stop using our products.\nWe are currently, and may in the future be, subject to claims and lawsuits that could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and result in harm to our business.\nWe are currently subject to a purported securities class action lawsuit, shareholder derivative litigation, and various commercial and product liability lawsuits, and we may be subject to additional claims and lawsuits in the future. In addition, we, as well as certain of our officers and sales representatives, are subject to claims or lawsuits from time to time. Regardless of the outcome, these lawsuits may result in significant legal fees and expenses and could divert management\u2019s time and other resources. If the claims contained in these lawsuits are successfully asserted against us, we could be liable for damages and be required to alter or cease certain of our business practices or product lines. Any of these outcomes could cause our business, financial performance and cash position to be negatively impacted. Litigation may also harm our relationships with existing customers and subject us to negative publicity, each of which could harm our business and financial results.\nOur ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology through patents and other means is uncertain.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our products and procedural solutions. We rely on patent protection, as well as a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, and nondisclosure, confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology. However, these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability.\nOur pending U.S. and foreign patent applications may not issue as patents at all or not in a form that will be advantageous to us or may issue and be subsequently successfully challenged by others and invalidated. Our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not have claims with a scope sufficient to protect our products, any additional features we develop for our products or any new products. Both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive. Other parties may have developed technologies that may be related or competitive to our technology, may have filed or may file patent applications and may have received or may receive patents that overlap or conflict with our patent applications, either by claiming the same methods or devices or by claiming subject matter that could dominate our patent position.\nIf we seek to enforce our intellectual property rights through litigation or other proceedings, it could require us to spend significant time and money, with uncertain results.\nIn the event a competitor infringes upon our patent or other intellectual property rights, enforcing those rights may be costly, difficult and time consuming. We may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against a challenge. Our ability to enforce our patent rights depends on our ability to detect infringement. It may be difficult to detect infringers who do not advertise the components that are used in their products. Moreover, it may be difficult or impossible to obtain evidence of infringement in a competitor\u2019s or potential competitor\u2019s product. The medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. It is not unusual for parties to exchange letters surrounding allegations of intellectual property infringement and licensing arrangements. In addition, the patent positions of medical device companies, including our patent position, may involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, the scope, validity and enforceability of any patent claims that we have or may obtain cannot be predicted with certainty.\nRecent changes in U.S. patent laws may limit our ability to obtain, defend and/or enforce our patents.\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and also affect patent litigation. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, which only became effective on March 16, 2013. The first to file provisions limit the rights of an inventor to patent an invention if not the first to file an application for patenting that invention, even if such invention was the first invention. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. The pool of prior art available to inhibit or limit our ability to obtain issued patents on the technology utilized in our products is expected to expand and the grace period for filing a patent application has been reduced in some ways. It is now possible for a situation to arise in which a competitor is able to obtain patent rights to technology which we invented first. Furthermore, the newly enacted patent laws have expanded the types of post grant challenges of issued patents and these proceedings may provide our competitors with additional opportunities to challenge the validity of our issued patents.\nAdditionally, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement and defense of our issued patents. For example, the Leahy-Smith Act provides that an administrative tribunal known as the Patent Trial and Appeals Board, or PTAB, provides a venue for challenging the validity of patents at a cost that is much lower than district court litigation and on timelines that are much faster. Although it is not clear what, if any, long-term impact the PTAB proceedings will have on the operation of our business, the initial results of patent challenge proceedings before the PTAB since its inception in 2013 have resulted in the invalidation of many U.S. patent claims. The availability of the PTAB as a lower-cost, faster and potentially more potent tribunal for challenging patents could increase the likelihood that our own patents will be challenged, thereby increasing the uncertainties and costs of maintaining and enforcing them.\nFurther, competitors may challenge our issued patents through post-grant challenge procedures (domestically) and/or opposition proceedings (internationally). The Leahy-Smith Act amended the post-grant challenge procedures in the U.S. to eliminate inter partes reexamination, maintain ex parte reexamination, and add inter partes review making it easier for third-parties to challenge issued patents. We are currently engaged in various such proceedings with respect to our issued patents and the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position could be harmed.\nIn addition to patent protection, we also rely upon copyright and trade secret protection, as well as non-disclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employee shareowners, consultants and third parties, to protect our confidential and proprietary information. In addition to contractual measures, we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using physical and technological security measures. Such measures may not, for example, in the case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee or third party with authorized access, provide adequate protection for our proprietary information. Our security measures may not prevent an employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor, and recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to copy or reverse engineer certain aspects of our products that we consider proprietary. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, trade secrets may be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. If any of our confidential or proprietary information, such as our trade secrets, were to be disclosed or misappropriated, or if any such information was independently developed by a competitor, our business and competitive position could be harmed.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. This could make it difficult for us to stop infringement of our foreign patents, if obtained, or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, some foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, some countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Patent protection must ultimately be sought on a country-by-country basis, which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of our intellectual property.\nThird parties may assert ownership or commercial rights to inventions we develop.\nThird parties may in the future make claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our intellectual property. We have written agreements with collaborators that provide for the ownership of intellectual property arising from our collaborations. In addition, we may face claims by third parties that our agreements with employee shareowners, contractors or consultants obligating them to assign intellectual property to us are ineffective or in conflict with prior or competing contractual obligations of assignment, which could result in ownership disputes regarding intellectual property we have developed or will develop and interfere with our ability to capture the commercial value of such intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to resolve an ownership dispute, and if we are not successful, we may be precluded from using certain intellectual property or may lose our exclusive rights in that intellectual property. Either outcome could harm our business and competitive position.\nThird parties may assert that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information or misappropriated trade secrets.\nWe employ individuals who previously worked with other companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employee shareowners and consultants do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or our personnel, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of a former employer or other third party. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims or settling those claims, in addition to paying monetary damages or a settlement payment, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and/or be a distraction to management and other employee shareowners.\nIf personal injury lawsuits are brought against us, our business may be harmed, and we may be required to pay damages that exceed our insurance coverage.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the testing, manufacture and sale of medical devices for surgical procedures, and potential malpractice claims that are inherent in the IOM services provided through our subsidiary, NuVasive Clinical Services. These surgeries involve significant risk of serious complications, including bleeding, nerve injury, paralysis and even death. We could become the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients. Additionally, our IOM services business could become the subject of medical malpractice lawsuits alleging negligence on the part of our neurophysiologists and/or oversight physicians.\nWe have had, and continue to have, a small number of personal injury claims relating to our products and clinical services, none of which either individually, or in the aggregate, have resulted, or do we believe will result, in a material negative impact on our business. In the future, we may be subject to additional personal injury claims, some of which may have a negative impact on our business. Regardless of the merit or eventual outcome, personal injury claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our products;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nsignificant litigation costs;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to or costly settlements with patients;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls;\n\u2022\nmaterial defense costs;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\nincreased insurance costs;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize new products or product candidates; and\n\u2022\ndiversion of management attention from pursuing our business strategy.\nOur existing insurance coverage for personal injury claims may be inadequate to protect us from any liabilities we might incur. If a personal injury claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of our insurance coverage, our business could suffer. In addition, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us against losses. Any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could severely harm our financial condition, strain our management and other resources and adversely affect or eliminate the prospects for commercialization of our IOM business or sales of a product or product candidate that is the subject of any such claim.\nRisks Related to Regulatory and Compliance\nWe are subject to rigorous FDA and other governmental regulations regarding the development, manufacture, and sale of our products and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that satisfy these regulations.\nThe medical devices we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities, including regulations that cover, among other things, the composition, labeling, testing, clinical study, manufacturing, packaging, marketing and distribution of our products.\nWe are required to register with the FDA as a device manufacturer and tissue bank. As a result, we are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation (QSR) and Good Tissue Practices requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices and tissue banks to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. Our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA. In the European Community, we are required to maintain certain ISO certifications in order to sell our products, and are subject to periodic inspections by Notified Bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications. If we or our suppliers fail to adhere to QSR, ISO or other applicable regulations and standards, it could negatively impact product production and regulatory clearances and could result in fines. Further our products could be subject to recall by the FDA or other regulatory bodies, or voluntarily by us, in the event of a material deficiency or defect in design, manufacture, labeling of a product or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. These and other consequences could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nMost medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized, and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product based upon the results of such post-marketing programs. In addition, the Federal Medical Device Reporting Regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, that could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Furthermore, most major markets for medical devices outside the United States require clearance, approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device, particularly from the FDA and certain foreign governmental authorities, can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals may not be granted for future products or product improvements on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products or product improvements could result in delayed realization of product revenue or in substantial additional costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or prospects. At any time after approval of a product, the FDA may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with both QSR requirements and/or current Medical Device Reporting regulations. If we fail to comply with our reporting obligations, the FDA could take action, including warning letters, untitled letters, administrative actions, criminal prosecution, imposition of civil monetary penalties, revocation of our device clearance, seizure of our products or delay in clearance of future products. Product clearances or approvals by the FDA can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial clearance or approval.\nAlso, the procurement and transplantation of allograft bone tissue is subject to the criminal statute National Organ Transplant Act and state rules and regulations which govern, among other things, payments we make to vendors in consideration for the services they provide in connection with the recovery and screening of donors. Failure to comply with such laws could result in enforcement action against us and a disruption to these product lines (and the revenue associated therewith).\nFailure or alleged failure to comply with FDA and other governmental regulations can result in investigations and other regulatory proceedings, which are expensive and could divert management attention.\nIf the FDA or other governmental authorities in the United States or abroad believes we are not conducting our business in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, such governmental authority can initiate investigations or other regulatory proceedings. Responding to such investigations and proceedings may cause us to incur substantial costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial resources and divert the attention of management from our core business. We could be subject to proceedings to detain or seize our products, product recalls, or operating restrictions, Moreover, governmental authorities can ban or request the recall, repair, replacement or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute. Any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are subject to federal, state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and health information privacy and security laws, which, if violated, could subject us to substantial penalties.\nThere are numerous U.S. federal and state, as well as foreign, laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, false claims and physician transparency laws. Our relationships with physicians, providers and hospitals are subject to scrutiny under these laws. We may also be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business.\nHealthcare fraud and abuse laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation, which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if they are found not to be in compliance. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs. Despite implementation of a comprehensive global healthcare compliance program, we cannot provide assurance that any of the healthcare fraud and abuse laws will not change or be interpreted in the future in a manner which restricts or adversely affects our business activities or relationships with healthcare professionals, nor can we make any assurances that authorities will not challenge or investigate our current or future activities under these laws.\nIn July 2015, we entered into a settlement agreement with the DOJ pursuant to which we paid $13.5 million to resolve an investigation into possible false or otherwise improper claims submitted to Medicare and Medicaid. We admitted no wrongdoing as part of the settlement. In August 2015, we received a CID issued by the DOJ pursuant to the federal False Claims Act. The CID requires the delivery of a wide range of documents and information related to an investigation by the DOJ concerning allegations that we assisted a physician group customer in submitting improper claims for reimbursement and made improper payments to the physician group in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. We are cooperating with the DOJ. No assurance can be given as to the timing or outcome of this investigation. Responding to government requests and investigations requires considerable resources, including the time and attention of management. If we were to become the subject of an enforcement action, including any action resulting from the investigation by the DOJ, it could result in negative publicity, penalties, fines, the exclusion of our products from reimbursement under federally-funded programs and/or prohibitions on our ability to sell our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe may fail to obtain or maintain foreign regulatory approvals to market our products in other countries.\nWe currently market our products internationally and intend to expand our international marketing. International jurisdictions require separate regulatory approvals and compliance with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedures vary among countries and may involve requirements for additional testing. Clearance or approval by the FDA does not ensure approval or certification by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval or certification by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval or certification by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. The foreign regulatory approval or certification process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA clearance or approval. We may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals or certifications and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market. If we fail to receive necessary approvals or certifications to commercialize our products in foreign jurisdictions on a timely basis, or at all, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining, FDA clearances or approvals for our future products or product enhancements, our ability to commercially distribute and market our products could suffer.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device, particularly from the FDA, can be costly and time consuming, and there can be no assurance that such clearances or approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. In particular, the FDA permits commercial distribution of a new, non-exempt, non-Class I medical device only after the device has received clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or receives approval under the premarket approval application (PMA) process. If clinical trials of our current or future product candidates do not produce results necessary to support regulatory approval, we will be unable to commercialize these products, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nThe FDA will clear marketing of a medical device through the 510(k) process if it is demonstrated that the new product is substantially equivalent to other 510(k)-cleared products. The PMA process is more costly, lengthy and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process. Additionally, any modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or efficacy, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, possibly, a PMA. The FDA may not agree with any of our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary. Our failure to comply with such regulations could lead to the imposition of injunctions, suspensions or loss of regulatory approvals, product recalls, termination of distribution, or product seizures. In the most egregious cases, criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible.\nThe misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our reputation in the marketplace, result in injuries that lead to product liability suits or result in costly investigations, fines or sanctions by regulatory bodies if we are deemed to have engaged in the promotion of these uses, any of which could be costly to our business.\nPursuant to FDA regulations, we can only market our products for cleared or approved uses. Although physicians are permitted to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA based on their medical judgment, we are prohibited from promoting products for such off-label uses. We train our marketing personnel and independent sales representatives and distributors to not promote our products for uses outside of the FDA-cleared indications. Although we believe our marketing, promotional materials and training programs for physicians do not constitute promotion of unapproved uses of our products, if the FDA or any foreign regulatory body determines that our marketing, promotional materials or training programs constitute promotion of an off-label use, we could be subject to significant fines in addition to regulatory enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action under other regulatory authority, such as false claims laws, if they consider our business activities to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant penalties, including, but not limited to, criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment of our operations.\nIn addition, there may be increased risk of injury to patients if physicians attempt to use our products off-label. Furthermore, the use of our products for indications other than those cleared by the FDA or approved by any foreign regulatory body may not effectively treat such conditions, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace among physicians and patients.\nIf we or our suppliers fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s quality system regulations or equivalent regulations and standards internationally, the manufacture and processing of our products could be delayed and we may be subject to an enforcement action by the FDA or other government agencies.\nWe and our suppliers are required to comply with the QSR and other applicable standards and requirements, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production or processing, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. The FDA and other regulatory bodies enforce compliance with regulatory requirements and standards through periodic inspections. If we or one of our suppliers fail an inspection or if any corrective action plan is not sufficient, the release of our products could be delayed. We have undergone inspections by the FDA and other regulatory bodies regarding our allograft business and FDA inspections regarding our medical device activities. In connection with these inspections as well as prior inspections, regulatory agencies have requested minor corrective actions, which we have implemented. There can be no assurance that the FDA will not subject us to further enforcement action and the FDA and other regulatory agencies may impose additional inspections at any time.\nAdditionally, we are the legal manufacturer of record for the products that are distributed and labeled by us, regardless of whether the products are manufactured by us or our suppliers. Thus, a failure by us or our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action against us by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:\n\u2022\nfines, injunctions, and civil penalties;\n\u2022\nrecall or seizure of our products;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022\nrefusing our request for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products;\n\u2022\nwithdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted; and\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution.\nWe or our suppliers may be the subject of claims for non-compliance with FDA regulations in connection with the processing or distribution of allograft products.\nIt is possible that allegations may be made against us or against donor recovery groups or tissue banks, including those with which we have a contractual relationship, claiming that the acquisition or processing of tissue for allograft products does not comply with applicable FDA regulations or other relevant statutes and regulations. Allegations like these could cause regulators or other authorities to take investigative or other action against us, or could cause negative publicity for us or our industry in general. These actions or any negative publicity could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert the attention of management from our business, harm our reputation and cause the market price of our shares to decline.\nCompliance with SEC regulations relating to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may increase our costs and adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to SEC regulations that require us to determine whether our products contain certain specified minerals, referred to under the regulations as \u201cconflict minerals\u201d, and, if so, to perform an extensive inquiry into our supply chain, in an effort to determine whether or not such conflict minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo (\u201cDRC\u201d), or an adjoining country. Compliance with these regulations has increased our costs, and we expect our costs may increase in the future. We have determined that certain of our products contain such specified minerals. As of the date of our conflict minerals report for the 2015 calendar year, we were unable to determine whether or not such minerals originate from the DRC or an adjoining country. We are continuing to conduct inquiries into our supply chain in connection with the preparation of our conflict minerals report for 2016, which must be audited by an independent auditor pursuant to existing government auditing standards. Compliance with these requirements has been time-consuming for management and our supply chain personnel (as well as time-consuming for our suppliers), and we expect that compliance will continue to require the expenditure of significant amounts of time and money by us and them. In addition, to the extent any of our disclosures are perceived by the market to be \u201cnegative,\u201d it may cause customers to refuse to purchase our products. Further, if we determine to make any changes to products, processes, or sources of supply, it may result in additional costs, which may adversely affect our business.\nLegislative or regulatory reforms may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our products or to produce, market or distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulation of medical devices or the reimbursement thereof. In addition, the FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new statutes, regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of any future products or make it more difficult to manufacture, market or distribute our products or future products. We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations, statutes, legal interpretation or policies, when and if promulgated, enacted or adopted may have on our business in the future. Such changes could, among other things, require:\n\u2022\nadditional testing prior to obtaining clearance or approval;\n\u2022\nchanges to manufacturing methods;\n\u2022\nrecall, replacement or discontinuance of our products or future products; or\n\u2022\nadditional record keeping.\nAny of these changes could require substantial time and cost and could harm our business and our financial results.\nOur relationships with physician consultants, owners and investors could be subject to additional scrutiny from regulatory enforcement authorities and could subject us to possible administrative, civil or criminal sanctions.\nFederal and state laws and regulations impose restrictions on our relationships with physicians who are consultants, owners and investors. We have entered into consulting agreements, license agreements and other agreements with physicians in which we provided equity awards or cash or both as compensation. Some of the physicians with which we have such consulting and other agreements are affiliated with some of our customers. Finally, we have other arrangements with physicians, including for research and development grants and for other purposes as well.\nWe could be adversely affected if regulatory agencies were to interpret our financial relationships with these physicians, who may be in a position to influence the ordering of and use of our products for which governmental reimbursement may be available, as being in violation of applicable laws. If our relationships with physicians are found to be in violation of the laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be required to restructure the arrangements and could be subject to administrative, civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could negatively impact our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials and we and our third-party manufacturers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which may be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur third-party manufacturers\u2019 activities and our own activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials. We and our manufacturers are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. We currently carry no insurance specifically covering environmental claims relating to the use of hazardous materials, but we do reserve funds to address these claims at both the federal and state levels. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials and waste products comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from the use, storage, handling or disposal of hazardous materials. In the event of an accident, state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. In addition, if an accident or environmental discharge occurs, or if we discover contamination caused by prior operations, including by prior owners and operators of properties we acquire, we could be liable for cleanup obligations, damages and fines. If such unexpected costs are substantial, this could significantly harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Results and Need for Financing\nWe may be unable to grow our revenue or earnings as anticipated, which may have a material adverse effect on our future operating results.\nWe have experienced rapid growth since our inception, and have increased our revenue from $38.4 million in 2004, the year of our initial public offering, to $962.1 million in 2016. Our ability to achieve future growth will depend upon, among other things, the success of our growth strategies, which we cannot assure will be successful. In addition, we may have more difficulty maintaining our prior rate of growth of revenue or recent levels of profitability and cash flow. Our future success will depend upon various factors, including the strength of our brand image, the market success of our current and future products, competitive conditions and our ability to manage increased revenue, if any, or implement our growth strategy. In addition, we anticipate significantly expanding our infrastructure and adding personnel in connection with our anticipated growth, which we expect will cause our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue. Because these expenses are generally fixed, particularly in the short-to-medium term, our operating and financial results may be adversely impacted if we do not achieve our anticipated growth.\nThe sale of Convertible Senior Notes significantly increased our amount of long-term debt, and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not efficiently manage our liabilities.\nIn June 2011, we issued $402.5 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2017 (the 2017 Notes). Additionally, in March 2016, we issued $650 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2021 (the 2021 Notes). Although we have repurchased a significant portion of the aggregate principal amount of the 2017 Notes, we continue to have a substantial amount of long-term debt as a result of the sale of the 2017 and 2021 Notes. Our maintenance of such debt could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, there are a large number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the potential conversion of our 2017 Notes and our 2021 Notes and the warrants that we issued as part of the related bond hedge transactions. The issuance of these shares may depress the market price of our common stock.\nIf we fail to comply with the covenants and other obligations under our credit facility, the lenders may be able to accelerate amounts owed under the facilities and may foreclose upon the assets securing our obligations.\nIn February 2016, we entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., or Bank of America, that provides for secured revolving facility loans, multicurrency loan options and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $150.0 million. The credit agreement also contains an expansion feature, which allows us to increase the aggregate principal amount of the credit facility provided we remain in compliance with the underlying financial covenants. All of our assets and the assets of our material domestic subsidiaries and certain material international subsidiaries are pledged as collateral under the credit facility (subject to customary exceptions) and each of our material domestic subsidiaries guarantee the credit facility. The covenants set forth in the credit agreement restrict, among other things, our ability to: create liens on assets, incur additional indebtedness, make investments, make acquisitions and other fundamental changes, sell and dispose of property or assets, pay dividends and other distributions, change the business conducted, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, enter into burdensome agreements, limit certain use of proceeds, amend organizational documents, change accounting policies or reporting practices, modify or terminate documents related to certain indebtedness, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, fund sanctions and use proceeds for any breach of anti-corruption laws. If we fail to comply with the covenants and our other obligations under the credit facility, Bank of America would be able to accelerate the required repayment of amounts due under the loan agreement and, if they are not repaid, could foreclose upon our assets securing our obligations under the credit facility.\nWe may need additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, and may be dilutive to existing stockholders.\nIn furtherance of our growth strategy and global expansion efforts, we intend to continue to invest in our business, including through acquisitions and strategic transactions. These investments will be expensive, and we may need to seek additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs. As of December 31, 2016, we had $153.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, we anticipate making a payment of $30.0 million to former stockholders of Ellipse Technologies under the merger agreement in connection with the acquisition of Ellipse Technologies. We may seek to raise capital from public and private debt and equity offerings, borrowings under our existing or future credit facilities or other sources. We may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our expansion, successfully develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could negatively affect our business. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to limitations on our operations due to restrictive covenants. Additionally, our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption, evolution or change of new and/or amended U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including the Netherlands, where a number of our subsidiaries are located. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate our worldwide tax liabilities. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our effective income tax rates have been, and could in the future be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those tax laws, by stock-based compensation and other non-deductible expenses, by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nAs part of our globalization initiative, we have centralized international operations in the Netherlands and have entered into intercompany transfer pricing arrangements, including the licensing of intangibles. We intend to continue to streamline our international operations to better align with and support our international business activities and markets through changes in how we develop, license and use our intangible property and how we structure our international procurement and customer service functions. We anticipate a negative impact to our effective tax rate over the next several years while achieving an overall reduction to our effective tax rate over the longer term. There can be no assurance that the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate or will operate or to which we are otherwise deemed to have sufficient tax presence will not challenge the tax benefits that we ultimately expect to realize as a result of our international structure. In addition, future changes to U.S. or non-U.S. tax laws, including proposed legislation to reform the U.S. taxation of international business, could negatively impact the anticipated tax benefits of our international structure. Any long term benefits to our tax rate will also depend on our ability to achieve our anticipated international growth projections and to operate our business in a manner consistent with our international structure and intercompany transfer pricing arrangements. If we do not operate our business consistent with the structure and applicable tax provisions, we may fail to achieve the financial efficiencies that we anticipate as a result of the structure and our future operating results and financial condition may be negatively impacted.\nFinally, we may be subject in the future to examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities which may result in the assessment of additional income taxes. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or the Netherlands or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe expect that the price of our common stock will fluctuate substantially, potentially adversely affecting the ability of investors to sell their shares.\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations, which may negatively affect the ability of investors to sell our shares at consistent prices. Fluctuation in the stock price may occur due to many factors, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and other factors related to the economy or otherwise, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors;\n\u2022\npeople\u2019s expectations, favorable or unfavorable, as to the likely unit growth of the spine sector;\n\u2022\nnegative stock market reactions to the results of litigation;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity regarding spine surgeon\u2019s practices or outcomes, whether warranted or not, that cast the sector in a negative light;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in the availability of third-party reimbursement in the United States or other countries;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments with respect to intellectual property rights or other potential legal actions;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, obtain regulatory clearance or approval for, and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our or our competitor\u2019s results of operations;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers and directors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological or medical innovations for the treatment of spine pathology;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals, clearances or applications;\n\u2022\nthe acquisition or divestiture of businesses, products, assets or technology by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nlitigation (including intellectual property litigation) and any associated negative verdicts or ruling;\n\u2022\nannouncements of actions by the FDA or other regulatory agencies; and\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings or operating margin estimates or recommendations by us or by securities analysts.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. Some of these provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of preferred stock which can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior stockholder approval, with rights senior to those of the common stock;\n\u2022\nprovide for a classified board of directors, with each director serving a staggered three-year term;\n\u2022\nprovide that our stockholders may remove our directors only for cause;\n\u2022\nprohibit our stockholders from filling board vacancies, calling special stockholder meetings, or taking action by written consent;\n\u2022\nprohibit our stockholders from making certain changes to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws except with 66 2/3% stockholder approval; and\n\u2022\nrequire advance written notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current board of directors, including delay or impede a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving our company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of any future debt or credit facility may preclude us from paying any dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our stockholders\u2019 source of potential gain for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 90188, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "NUVA"}
