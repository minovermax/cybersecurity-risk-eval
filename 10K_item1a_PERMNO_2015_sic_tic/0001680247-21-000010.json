{"cik": "1680247", "company": "ProPetro Holding Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-05", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following is a description of significant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statement made in this Annual Report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. Such factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all our potential risks or uncertainties. Due to these, and other factors, past performance should not be considered an indication of future performance.\nRisks Inherent in Our Business and Industry\nOur business and financial performance depends on the oil and natural gas industry and particularly on the level of capital spending and exploration and production activity within the United States and in the Permian Basin, and a decline in prices for oil and natural gas has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our revenue, cash flows, profitability and growth.\nDemand for most of our services depends substantially on the level of capital expenditures in the Permian Basin by companies in the oil and natural gas industry. As a result, our operations are dependent on the levels of capital spending and activity in oil and gas exploration, development and production. Demand for our services is largely dependent on oil and natural gas prices, and our customers\u2019 completion budgets and rig count. Prolonged low oil and gas prices would generally depress the level of oil and natural gas exploration, development, production, and well completion activity and would result in a corresponding decline in the demand for the hydraulic fracturing services that we provide. For many years, oil prices and markets have been extremely volatile. Prices are affected by many factors beyond our control. WTI oil prices declined significantly in 2015 and 2016 to approximately $30 per barrel, but subsequently recovered in 2017. However, in 2020, oil and natural gas prices were highly volatile. The average WTI oil prices per barrel were approximately $39, $57 and $65 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In March 2020, WTI oil prices declined significantly, to a low of approximately $20 per barrel towards the end of March 2020. On March 3, 2021, the WTI oil price was approximately $62 per barrel. In 2020, the highly volatile and unpredictable nature of oil and natural gas prices caused a reduction in our customers\u2019 spending and associated drilling and completion activities, which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our revenue and cash flows, if WTI oil prices do not recover and remain highly volatile. We are also experiencing pricing pressure on our services from substantially all of our customers which has decreased margins for us. If prices continue to decline or remain low and are highly unpredictable, additional declines in our customers\u2019 spending would have a further adverse effect on our revenue, margins and cash flows. In addition, a worsening of these conditions may result in a material adverse impact on certain of our customers\u2019 liquidity and financial position resulting in further spending reductions, delays in the collection of amounts owed to us and similar impacts.\nMany factors over which we have no control affect the supply of, and demand for our services, and our customers\u2019 willingness to explore, develop and produce oil and natural gas, and therefore, influence prices for our services, including:\n\u2022the severity and duration of world health events, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, related economic repercussions and the resulting severe disruption in the oil and gas industry and negative impact on demand for oil and gas, which is negatively impacting our business;\n\u2022the current supply and demand imbalance for crude oil, and actions by the members of OPEC+ with respect to oil production levels and announcements of potential changes in such levels, including the ability of the OPEC+ countries to agree on and comply with supply limitations;\n\u2022uncertainty regarding the timing, pace and extent of an economic recovery in the United States and elsewhere, which in turn will likely affect demand for crude oil and natural gas and therefore the demand for our services;\n\u2022the domestic and foreign supply of, and demand for, oil and natural gas;\n\u2022the level of prices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production;\n\u2022the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022the supply of and demand for drilling and hydraulic fracturing equipment, including the supply and demand for lower emissions hydraulic fracturing equipment;\n\u2022the expected decline rates of current production;\n\u2022the price and quantity of foreign imports;\n\u2022political and economic conditions in oil and natural gas producing countries and regions, including the United States, the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia;\n\u2022operational challenges relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus, including logistical challenges, protecting the health and well-being of our employees, remote work arrangements, performance of contracts and supply chain disruptions;\n\u2022speculative trading in crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts;\n\u2022the level of consumer product demand;\n\u2022the discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022contractions in the credit market;\n\u2022the strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar;\n\u2022available pipeline and other transportation capacity;\n\u2022the levels of oil and natural gas storage;\n\u2022weather conditions and other natural disasters;\n\u2022domestic and foreign tax policy;\n\u2022domestic and foreign governmental approvals and regulatory requirements and conditions, including tighter emissions standards in the energy industry;\n\u2022the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action, including military action in the Middle East;\n\u2022political or civil unrest in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u2022technical advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022the proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities;\n\u2022the price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u2022the ability of oil and natural gas producers to raise equity capital and debt financing;\n\u2022merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers; and\n\u2022overall domestic and global economic conditions.\nThese factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty. For example, in March 2020, Saudi Arabia and Russia failed to agree on a plan to cut production of oil and gas within OPEC and Russia. Subsequently, Saudi Arabia announced plans to increase production and reduce the prices at which they sell oil. These events, combined with the COVID-19 pandemic that has negatively impacted the economic activity and disrupted the supply chain of certain of our customers, have contributed to the depressed demand for crude oil and crude oil prices. Regulatory action to curtail production has been contemplated; for example, the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the production of oil and gas in the state of Texas, held a hearing in April 2020 regarding potential production cuts for producers in Texas in light of the recent decline in oil prices globally. The Railroad Commission ultimately declined to institute mandatory production cuts, but the agency may choose to revisit the issue if market weakness persists, which could further reduce demand for our services. While an agreement to significantly cut production was reached by OPEC+ in April 2020, and in January 2021 the production levels continued to be adjusted by OPEC+ with the aim to rebalance demand and supply, oil prices have remained volatile, and global oil demand is expected to remain challenged at least until the COVID-19 virus and infection rate can be contained. The\nimpacts of the uncertainties in the energy industry and global economy have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nThe cyclical nature of the oil and natural gas industry may cause our operating results to fluctuate.\nWe derive our revenues from companies in the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry, a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and natural gas prices. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, significant fluctuations in operating results as a result of the reactions of our customers to changes in oil and natural gas prices. For example, the decline in and unpredictable nature of oil and gas prices in 2019 and 2020, combined with adverse changes in the capital and credit markets and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, caused many exploration and production companies to reduce their capital budgets and drilling activity. This has resulted in a significant decline in demand for oilfield services and adversely impacted the prices oilfield services companies can charge for their services. These factors have materially and adversely affected our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, a majority of the service revenue we earn is based upon a charge for a relatively short period of time (for example, a day, a week or a month) for the actual period of time the service is provided to our customers. By contracting services on a short-term basis, we are exposed to the risks of a rapid reduction in market prices and utilization and resulting volatility in our revenues.\nEvents outside of our control, including an epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, may materially adversely affect our business.\nWe face risks related to epidemics, outbreaks or other public health events that are outside of our control, and could significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial condition. The global or national outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis, such as COVID-19, may cause disruptions to our business and operational plans, which may include (i) shortages of employees, (ii) unavailability of contractors and subcontractors, (iii) interruption of supplies from third parties upon which we rely, (iv) recommendations of, or restrictions imposed by, government and health authorities, including quarantines, to address the COVID-19 outbreak and (v) restrictions that we and our contractors, subcontractors and our customers impose, including facility shutdowns, to ensure the safety of employees. For example, in response to COVID-19, we have reduced headcount, closed yard locations, reduced third-party expenses, streamlined operations, reduced capital expenditures and recorded impairment expenses.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the globe and impacted financial markets and worldwide economic activity and adversely affected our operations. In addition, the effects of COVID-19 across the globe have negatively impacted the domestic and international demand for crude oil and natural gas, which has contributed to price volatility, impacted the operations and activity levels of our customers and materially and adversely affected the demand for oilfield services. These factors may also negatively impact our current suppliers and their ability or willingness to provide the necessary equipment, parts or raw materials, and they may otherwise fail to deliver the products timely and in the quantities required. Any resulting delays or restrictions from COVID-19 on the provision of our services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As the potential impact from COVID-19 is difficult to predict, the extent to which it may negatively affect our operating results or the duration of any potential business disruption is uncertain. Any potential impact will depend on future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the COVID-19 infection rate or the efficacy and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, and the actions taken by authorities to contain it or treat its impact, all of which are beyond our control. These potential impacts, while uncertain, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe majority of our operations are located in the Permian Basin, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area.\nOur operations are geographically concentrated in the Permian Basin. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, approximately 99.5%, 99.4% and 99.0%, respectively, of our revenues were attributable to our operations in the Permian Basin. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in the Permian Basin caused by significant governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, curtailment of production or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil and natural gas produced from the wells in these areas. In addition, the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and natural gas producing areas such as the Permian Basin, which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effects of these conditions. Due to the concentrated nature of our operations, we could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our revenue than they might have on other companies that have more geographically diverse operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected by a deterioration in general economic conditions or a weakening of the broader energy industry.\nA prolonged economic slowdown or recession in the United States, adverse events relating to the energy industry or regional, national and global economic conditions and factors, particularly a further slowdown in the exploration and production industry, could negatively impact our operations and therefore adversely affect our results. The risks associated with our business are more acute during periods of economic slowdown or recession because such periods may be accompanied by decreased exploration and development spending by our customers, decreased demand for oil and natural gas and decreased prices for oil and natural gas. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent turmoil between the members of OPEC+ caused oil prices to fall substantially and have impacted the global economy; such factors have heightened the risk of a prolonged economic slowdown or recession in the United States.\nNew technology may cause us to become less competitive.\nThe oilfield services industry is subject to the introduction of new drilling and completion techniques and services using new technologies, some of which may be subject to patent or other intellectual property protections. As competitors and others use or develop new or comparable technologies in the future, we may lose market share or be placed at a competitive disadvantage. The transition to lower emissions equipment is capital intensive and could require us to convert our conventional Tier II equipment to lower emissions equipment. If we are unable to quickly transition to lower emissions equipment, the demand for our services could be adversely impacted. For example, many E&P companies, including our customers, are transitioning to a lower emissions operating environment and may require us to invest in pressure pumping equipment with lower emissions profile. Further, we may face competitive pressure to develop, implement or acquire and deploy certain technology improvements at a substantial cost, such as our new DuraStim\u00ae fleets or the cost of implementing or purchasing a technology like the new DuraStim\u00ae fleets may be substantially higher than anticipated, and we may not be able to successfully implement the DuraStim\u00ae fleets or other technologies we may purchase. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that may allow them to enjoy technological advantages and develop and implement new products on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. We cannot be certain that we will be able to develop and implement new technologies or products on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. Limits on our ability to develop, effectively use and implement new and emerging technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations.\nOur operations require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, or at all, which could limit our ability to grow.\nThe oilfield services industry is capital intensive. In conducting our business and operations, we have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial capital expenditures. Our total capital expenditures incurred were approximately $81.2 million, $400.7 million and $592.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. We have historically financed capital expenditures primarily with funding from cash on hand, cash flow from operations, equipment and vendor financing and borrowings under our credit facility. We may be unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and other capital resources to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures which, among other things, may prevent us from acquiring new equipment (including equipment with a lower emissions profile) or properly maintaining our existing equipment. With the current depressed oil and gas market conditions, our availability under our ABL Credit Facility has been adversely impacted by the expected decline in our customers\u2019 activity and we may be unable to borrow under our ABL Credit Facility if our eligible accounts receivable continues to decline. Further, any disruptions or continuing volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations. For example, our borrowing base changed from $55.6 million as of December 31, 2020 to approximately $48.9 million as of March 3, 2021 due to a decrease in our eligible accounts receivable. If our customer activity levels do not improve or decline in the future, our borrowing base could decline. This could put us at a competitive disadvantage or interfere with our growth plans. Further, our actual capital expenditures could exceed our capital expenditure budget. In the event our capital expenditure requirements at any time are greater than the amount of liquidity we have available, we could be required to seek additional sources of capital, which may include debt financing, joint venture partnerships, sales of assets, offerings of debt or equity securities or other means. We may not be able to obtain any such alternative source of capital. We may be required to curtail or eliminate contemplated activities. If we can obtain alternative sources of capital, the terms of such alternative may not be favorable to us. In particular, the terms of any debt financing may include covenants that significantly restrict our operations. Our inability to grow as planned may reduce our chances of maintaining and improving profitability.\nConcerns over general economic, business or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nConcerns over global economic conditions, geopolitical issues, public health crises (including the COVID-19 pandemic), interest rates, inflation, the availability and cost of credit in the United States and foreign financial markets have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. These factors, combined with volatility in commodity prices, business and consumer confidence and unemployment rates, have precipitated an economic slowdown. Concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. The decline in and unpredictable nature of oil and natural gas prices have caused a reduction in our customers\u2019 spending and associated drilling and completion activities, which had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our revenue and cash flows. If the current economic climate in the United States or abroad continues, deteriorates further or remains uncertain, worldwide demand for petroleum products could diminish further, which could impact the price at which oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids can be sold, which could affect the ability of our customers to continue operations and adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur indebtedness and liquidity needs could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nOur existing and future indebtedness, whether incurred in connection with acquisitions, operations or otherwise, may adversely affect our operations and limit our growth, and we may have difficulty making debt service payments on such indebtedness as payments become due. Our level of indebtedness may affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u2022 increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022 the covenants that are contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness could limit our ability to borrow funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;\n\u2022 our debt covenants could also affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry;\n\u2022 any failure to comply with the financial or other debt covenants, including covenants that impose requirements to maintain certain financial ratios, could result in an event of default, which could result in some or all of our indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable;\n\u2022 our level of debt could impair our ability to obtain additional financing, or obtain additional financing on favorable terms in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; and\n\u2022 our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to meet our obligations under our indebtedness.\nRestrictions in our Asset Backed Loan (ABL) Credit Facility (as defined herein) and any future financing agreements may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or capitalize on potential acquisitions and other business opportunities.\nThe operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our credit facility and any future financing agreements could restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to expand or pursue our business activities. For example, our ABL Credit Facility restricts or limits our ability to:\n\u2022grant liens;\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022engage in a merger, consolidation or dissolution;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022sell or otherwise dispose of assets, businesses and operations;\n\u2022materially alter the character of our business as currently conducted; and\n\u2022make acquisitions, investments and capital expenditures.\nFurthermore, our ABL Credit Facility contains certain other operating and financial covenants. Our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the ABL Credit Facility may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If we violate any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests in our ABL Credit Facility, a significant portion of our indebtedness may become immediately due and payable and our lenders\u2019 commitment to make further loans to us may terminate. Further, our borrowing base, as redetermined monthly, is tied to 85.0% of eligible accounts receivable. Changes to our operational activity levels or customer concentration levels have an impact on our total eligible accounts receivable, which could result in significant changes to our borrowing base and therefore our availability under our ABL Credit Facility. For example, our borrowing base changed from $55.6 million as of December 31, 2020 to approximately $48.9 million as of March 3, 2021 due to a decrease in our eligible accounts receivable. If our customer activity declines in the future, our borrowing base could decline. If our borrowing base is reduced below the amount of our outstanding borrowings, we will be required to repay the excess borrowings immediately on demand by the lenders. We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. Any subsequent replacement of our ABL Credit Facility or any new indebtedness could have similar or greater restrictions. Please read \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Credit Facility and Other Financing Arrangements.\u201d\nWe may incur debt and our indebtedness could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur business is capital intensive and we may seek to raise debt capital to fund our business and growth strategy. Indebtedness could have negative consequences that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects, such as:\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operating activities to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, potential strategic acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund growth, working capital or capital expenditures, or to fulfill debt service requirements or other cash requirements;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to economic downturns and changing market conditions; and\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have less debt.\nFurthermore, interest rates on future indebtedness could be higher than current levels, causing our financing costs to increase accordingly. In addition, LIBOR and other \u201cbenchmark\u201d rates are subject to ongoing national and international regulatory scrutiny and reform. In July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR and we are unable to predict the effect of any such alternatives on our business and results of operations. However, if LIBOR is phased out without a replacement benchmark, our only option under the ABL Credit Facility will be to borrow at the Base Rate (as defined in the ABL Credit Facility) until an alternative benchmark rate is selected. Changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our shares, and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on the price of our shares, our ability to issue equity or incur debt.\nWe may record losses or impairment charges related to goodwill and long-lived assets.\nChanges in future market conditions and prolonged periods of low utilization, changes in technology or the sale of assets below their carrying value may cause us to experience losses in our results of operations. These events could result in the recognition of impairment charges or losses from asset sales that negatively impact our financial results. Significant impairment charges or losses from asset sales as a result of a decline in market conditions or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods. For example, in 2020, we recorded an impairment charge related to goodwill, our hydraulic fracturing and drilling assets, and deposits related to options to purchase additional DuraStim\u00ae equipment of $38.0 million. If oil and natural gas prices trade at depressed price levels as experienced in the first half of 2020, and our equipment remains idle or under-utilized, the estimated fair value of such equipment may decline, which will result in additional impairment expense in the future.\nOur operations are subject to unforeseen interruptions and hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, for which we may not be adequately insured and which could cause us to lose customers and substantial revenue.\nOur operations are exposed to the risks inherent to our industry, such as equipment defects, vehicle accidents, worksite injuries to our or third-party personnel, fires, explosions, blowouts, surface cratering, uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids, pipe or pipeline failures, abnormally pressured formations and various environmental hazards, such as oil spills and releases of, and exposure to, hazardous substances. For example, our operations are subject to risks associated with hydraulic fracturing, including any mishandling, surface spillage or potential underground migration of fracturing fluids, including hydrochloric acid and other chemical additives. In addition, our operations are exposed to potential natural disasters, including blizzards, tornadoes, storms, floods, other adverse weather conditions and earthquakes. The occurrence of any of these events could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties or other damage resulting in curtailment or suspension of our operations or the loss of customers. The cost of managing such risks may be significant. The frequency and severity of such incidents will affect operating costs, insurability and relationships with customers, employees and regulators. In particular, our customers may elect not to purchase our services if they view our environmental or safety record as unacceptable, which could cause us to lose customers and substantial revenues.\nOur insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities we may suffer. Furthermore, we may be unable to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased and could escalate further. In addition, sub-limits have been imposed for certain risks. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we are not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations. This may cause us to restrict our operations, which might severely impact our financial position.\nSince hydraulic fracturing activities are part of our operations, they are covered by our insurance against claims made for bodily injury, property damage and clean-up costs stemming from a sudden and accidental pollution event. However, we may not have coverage if we are unaware of the pollution event and unable to report the \u201coccurrence\u201d to our insurance company within the time frame required under our insurance policy. In addition, these policies do not provide coverage for all liabilities, and the insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover claims that may arise, or we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nA terrorist attack, armed conflict or political or civil unrest could harm our business.\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts, other armed conflicts and political or civil unrest could adversely affect the U.S. and global economies and could prevent us from meeting financial and other obligations. We could experience loss of business, delays or defaults in payments from payors or disruptions of fuel supplies and markets if pipelines, production facilities, processing plants, refineries or transportation facilities are direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war. Such activities could reduce the overall demand for oil and natural gas, which, in turn, could also reduce the demand for our services. Terrorist activities, the threat of potential terrorist activities, political or civil unrest and any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect our results of operations, impair our ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely impact our ability to realize certain business strategies.\nWe may be subject to claims for personal injury and property damage, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate with most of our customers under master service agreements (\u201cMSAs\u201d). We endeavor to allocate potential liabilities and risks between the parties in the MSAs. Generally, under our MSAs, including those relating to our hydraulic fracturing services, we assume responsibility for, including control and removal of, pollution or contamination which originates above surface and originates from our equipment or services. Our customer assumes responsibility for, including control and removal of, all other pollution or contamination which may occur during operations, including that which may result from seepage or any other uncontrolled flow of drilling fluids. We may have liability in such cases if we are negligent or commit willful acts. Generally, our customers also agree to indemnify us against claims arising from their employees\u2019 personal injury or death to the extent that, in the case of our hydraulic fracturing operations, their employees are injured or their properties are damaged by such operations, unless resulting from our gross negligence or willful misconduct. Similarly, we generally agree to indemnify our customers for liabilities arising from personal injury to or death of any of our employees, unless resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct of the customer. In addition,\nour customers generally agree to indemnify us for loss or destruction of customer-owned property or equipment and in turn, we agree to indemnify our customers for loss or destruction of property or equipment we own. Losses due to catastrophic events, such as blowouts, are generally the responsibility of the customer. However, despite this general allocation of risk, we might not succeed in enforcing such contractual allocation, might incur an unforeseen liability falling outside the scope of such allocation or may be required to enter into an MSA with terms that vary from the above allocations of risk. Litigation arising from a catastrophic occurrence at a location where our equipment and services are being used may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims. As a result, we may incur substantial losses which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nThe oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain processing activities. For example, we depend on digital technologies to perform many of our services and process and record operational and accounting data. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have increased. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. Our technologies, systems and networks, and those of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary information, personal information and other data, or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as unauthorized surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. Our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks, including cyberattacks, may not be sufficient and may not protect against or cover all of the losses we may experience as a result of the realization of such risks. As cyber incidents continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate the effects of cyber incidents.\nWe may grow through acquisitions and our failure to properly plan and manage those acquisitions may adversely affect our performance.\nWe have completed and may in the future pursue, asset acquisitions or acquisitions of businesses. Any acquisition of assets or businesses involves potential risks, including the failure to realize expected profitability, growth or accretion; environmental or regulatory compliance matters or liability; title or permit issues; the incurrence of significant charges, such as impairment of goodwill, or property and equipment or restructuring charges; and the incurrence of unanticipated liabilities and costs for which indemnification is unavailable or inadequate. The process of upgrading acquired assets to our specifications and integrating acquired assets or businesses may also involve unforeseen costs and delays or other operational, technical and financial difficulties and may require a significant amount of time and resources and may divert management\u2019s attention from existing operations or other priorities.\nWe must plan and manage any acquisitions effectively to achieve revenue growth and maintain profitability in our evolving market. Any failure to manage acquisitions effectively or integrate acquired assets or businesses into our existing operations successfully, or to realize the expected benefits from an acquisition or minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations.\nThe SEC\u2019s pending investigation, the Logan Lawsuit and the Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation, and cash flows.\nIn September 2019, a complaint, captioned Richard Logan, Individually and On Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated, Plaintiff, v. ProPetro Holding Corp., et al., (the \u201cLogan Lawsuit\u201d), was filed against the Company and certain of its then current and former officers and directors in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas.\nIn July 2020, the Logan Lawsuit Lead Plaintiffs Nykredit Portef\u00f8lje Administration A/S, Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System, Oklahoma Law Enforcement Retirement System, Oklahoma Police Pension and Retirement System, Oklahoma City Employee Retirement System and additional named plaintiff Police and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit, individually and on behalf of a putative class of shareholders who purchased the Company\u2019s common stock between March 17, 2017 and March 13, 2020, filed a third amended class action complaint against the Company and certain of its then current and former officers and directors in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule l0b-5 promulgated thereunder, and Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), based on allegedly inaccurate or misleading statements, or omissions of material facts, about the Company\u2019s business, operations and prospects. In August 2020, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the Logan Lawsuit and in September\n2020, the plaintiffs filed their opposition. In October 2020, the Company filed its reply brief in support of the motion to dismiss.\nIn May 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas consolidated two shareholder derivative lawsuits previously filed against the Company and certain of its then current and former officers and directors into a single lawsuit captioned In re ProPetro Holding Corp. Derivative Litigation (the \u201cShareholder Derivative Lawsuit\u201d). In August 2020, the plaintiffs in the Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit filed a consolidated complaint alleging (i) breaches of fiduciary duties, (ii) unjust enrichment and (iii) contribution. The plaintiffs did not quantify any alleged damages in the complaint but, in addition to attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, they seek various forms of relief, including (i) damages sustained by the Company as a result of the alleged misconduct, (ii) punitive damages and (iii) equitable relief in the form of improvements to the Company\u2019s governance and controls. In October 2020, the Company and other defendants filed motions to dismiss the Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit and in December 2020, the plaintiffs filed their opposition. In January 2021, the Company and other defendants filed reply briefs in support of the motion to dismiss.\nIn October 2019, the Company received a letter from the SEC indicating that the SEC had opened an investigation into the Company, which followed the SEC\u2019s issuance of a formal order of investigation, and requesting that the Company provide certain information and documents, including documents related to the Company\u2019s expanded audit committee review and related events. The Company has cooperated and expects to continue to cooperate with the SEC\u2019s investigation.\nWe are presently unable to predict the duration, scope or result of the Logan Lawsuit, the Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit, the SEC investigation, or any other related lawsuit or investigation.\nThe ongoing SEC investigation, the Logan Lawsuit, the Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit, and any related future litigation give rise to risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, uncertainty as to the scope, timing and ultimate findings of the matters under review by the SEC; adverse effects of the investigation, including the potential impact to the Company or members of its management team in the event of an adverse outcome and on the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock; the costs and expenses of the SEC investigation, the Logan Lawsuit and the Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit, including legal fees and possible monetary penalties in the event of an adverse outcome; the risk of additional potential litigation or regulatory action arising from these matters, including the Logan Lawsuit and the Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit, the timing of the review by, and the conclusions of, the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm regarding these matters; the potential identification of additional deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures and the impact of the same; and potential reputational damage that the Company may suffer as a result of these matters.\nThe SEC has a broad range of civil sanctions available should it commence an enforcement action, including injunctive relief, disgorgement, fines, penalties, or an order to take remedial action. The imposition of any of these sanctions, fines, or remedial measures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nThe outcome of the Logan Lawsuit, the Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit, and any other litigation is necessarily uncertain. We could be forced to expend significant resources in the defense of these lawsuits or future ones, and we may not prevail.\nWe maintain director and officer insurance; however, our insurance coverage is subject to certain exclusions (including, for example, any required SEC disgorgement or penalties) and we are responsible for meeting certain deductibles under the policies. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will adequately protect us from claims made in the Logan Lawsuit, the Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit, the SEC investigation or any future claims. Further, as a result of the pending litigation and investigation the costs of insurance may increase and the availability of coverage may decrease. As a result, we may not be able to maintain our current levels of insurance at a reasonable cost, or at all.\nRisks Related to Customers, Suppliers and Competition\nWe face significant competition that may cause us to lose market share, and competition in our industry has intensified during the industry downturn.\nThe oilfield services industry is highly competitive and has relatively few barriers to entry. The principal competitive factors impacting sales of our services are price, reputation and technical expertise, equipment and service\nquality and health and safety standards. The market is also fragmented and includes numerous small companies capable of competing effectively in our markets on a local basis, as well as several large companies that possess substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Our larger competitors\u2019 greater resources could allow those competitors to compete more effectively than we can. For instance, our larger competitors may offer services at below-market prices or bundle ancillary services at no additional cost to our customers. We compete with large national and multi-national companies that have longer operating histories, greater financial, technical and other resources and greater name recognition than we do. Several of our competitors provide a broader array of services and have a stronger presence in more geographic markets. In addition, we compete with several smaller companies capable of competing effectively on a regional or local basis.\nSome jobs are awarded on a bid basis, which further increases competition based on price. Pricing is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job. The competitive environment may be further intensified by tighter emissions standards in the energy industry and mergers and acquisitions among oil and natural gas companies or other events that have the effect of reducing the number of available customers. As a result of competition, we may lose market share or be unable to maintain or increase prices for our present services or to acquire additional business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services and changes in customer requirements. The amount of equipment available may exceed demand, which could result in active price competition. In addition, some exploration and production companies have commenced completing their wells using their own hydraulic fracturing equipment and personnel. Any increase in the development and utilization of in-house fracturing capabilities by our customers could decrease the demand for our services and have a material adverse impact on our business.\nPressure on pricing for our services resulting from the industry downturn has impacted, and may continue to impact, our ability to maintain utilization and pricing for our services or implement price increases. During periods of declining pricing for our services, we may not be able to reduce our costs accordingly, which could further adversely affect our results of operations. Also, we may not be able to successfully increase prices without adversely affecting our utilization levels. The inability to maintain our utilization and pricing levels, or to increase our prices as costs increase, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, competition among oilfield service and equipment providers is affected by each provider\u2019s reputation for safety and quality. We cannot assure that we will be able to maintain our competitive position.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers. Our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully eliminate customer credit risk. If we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers or unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness, any resulting increase in nonpayment or nonperformance by them and our inability to re-market or otherwise use the production could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays and failures to pay due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers\u2019 cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets or other sources of capital. The decline in and unpredictable nature of oil and gas prices in 2019 and 2020 has negatively impacted the financial condition and liquidity of our customers, and future declines, sustained lower prices, or continued volatility could impact their ability to meet their financial obligations to us. If our customers delay paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur business depends upon our ability to obtain specialized equipment, parts and key raw materials, including sand and chemicals, from third-party suppliers, and we may be vulnerable to delayed deliveries and future price increases.\nWe purchase specialized equipment, parts and raw materials (including, for example, frac sand, chemicals and fluid ends) from third party suppliers and affiliates. At times during the business cycle, there is a high demand for hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield services and extended lead times to obtain equipment and raw materials needed to provide these services. Should our current suppliers be unable or unwilling to provide the necessary equipment, parts or raw materials or otherwise fail to deliver the products timely and in the quantities required, any resulting delays in the provision of our services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, future price increases for this type of equipment, parts and raw materials could negatively\nimpact our ability to purchase new equipment, to update or expand our existing fleets, to timely repair equipment in our existing fleets or meet the current demands of our customers. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may have a negative impact on our suppliers\u2019 ability or willingness to provide necessary equipment, parts or raw materials, and they may otherwise fail to deliver the products timely and in the quantities required.\nWe may be required to pay fees to certain of our sand suppliers based on minimum volumes under long-term contracts regardless of actual volumes received.\nWe enter into purchase agreements with sand suppliers (the \u201cSand suppliers\u201d) to secure supply of sand in the normal course of our business. The agreements with the Sand suppliers require that we purchase certain sand volumes, which is based on a certain percentage of our overall sand requirements and agreed minimum volumes, otherwise certain penalties may be charged. Under certain of the purchase agreements, a shortfall fee applies if we purchase less than the agreed percentage of our sand requirements or agreed minimum volumes. The shortfall fee represents liquidated damages and is either a fixed percentage of the purchase price for the minimum volumes or a fixed price per ton of unpurchased volumes. Our current agreements with Sand suppliers expire at different times prior to April 30, 2022.\nIf the activity level of our customers declines and the demand for our services is materially and adversely affected, we may be required to pay for more sand from one of our Sand suppliers than we need in the performance of our services, regardless of whether we take physical delivery of such sand. In such an event, we may be required to pay shortfall fees or other penalties under the purchase agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. The decrease in our customers\u2019 activity resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and depressed energy market, among other factors, has heightened the risk that we may be required to pay shortfall fees or other penalties to at least one of our Sand suppliers in the future.\nReliance upon a few large customers may adversely affect our revenue and operating results.\nThe majority of our revenue is generated from our hydraulic fracturing services. Due to the large percentage of our revenue historically derived from our hydraulic fracturing services with recurring customers and the limited availability of our fracturing units, we have had some degree of customer concentration. Our top ten customers represented approximately 97.3%, 95.5% and 85.5% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. It is likely that we will depend on a relatively small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue in the future. If a major customer fails to pay us, revenue would be impacted and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nAdditionally, if we were to lose any material customer, we may not be able to redeploy our equipment at similar utilization or pricing levels and such loss could have an adverse effect on our business until the equipment is redeployed at similar utilization or pricing levels. One customer, Pioneer, accounted for 42.5% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. The revenue generated from our relationship with Pioneer is largely derived from pressure pumping and related services provided pursuant to the Pressure Pumping Services Agreement (the \u201cPioneer Services Agreement\u201d). Although the Pioneer Services Agreement provides for the provision of services for a term of up to 10 years, Pioneer has the right to terminate the Pioneer Services Agreement in its sole discretion, in whole or part, effective as of December 31 of each of the calendar years of 2022, 2024 and 2026. While management believes our relationship with Pioneer will continue beyond December 31, 2022, if Pioneer elects to terminate the Pioneer Services Agreement effective December 31, 2022, or seeks to renegotiate the terms on which we provide services to Pioneer, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Employees\nWe rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business.\nMany key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees. The loss of their services could adversely affect our business. In particular, the loss of the services of one or more members of our executive team, such as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Strategy and Administrative Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and General Counsel could disrupt our operations. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies on any of our employees. As a result, we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees.\nIf we are unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled and qualified workers, our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired.\nThe delivery of our services requires skilled and qualified workers with specialized skills and experience who can perform physically demanding work. As a result of the volatility of the oilfield services industry and the demanding nature of the work, workers may choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a more desirable work environment at wage rates that are competitive. Our ability to be productive and profitable will depend upon our ability to employ and retain skilled workers. In addition, our ability to expand our operations depends in part on our ability to increase the size of our skilled labor force. As a result of the downturn in the oil and gas industry resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and depressed energy market, among other factors, we have made reductions in the size of workforce due to reduced demand for our services. If demand for our services increases, we may experience difficulty in hiring or re-hiring skilled and unskilled workers in the future to meet that demand. At times, the demand for skilled workers in our geographic areas of operations is high, and the supply is limited. As a result, competition for experienced oilfield service personnel is intense, and we face significant challenges in competing for crews and management with large and well-established competitors. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force, increases in the wage rates that we must pay, or both. Furthermore, a significant decrease in the wages paid by us or our competitors as a result of reduced industry demand could result in a reduction of the available skilled labor force, and there is no assurance that the availability of skilled labor will improve following a subsequent increase in demand for our services or an increase in wages. If either of these events were to occur, our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations, and future compliance, claims, and liabilities relating to such matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nThe nature of our operations, including the handling, storing, transporting and disposing of a variety of fluids and substances, including hydraulic fracturing fluids, which can contain substances such as hydrochloric acid, and other regulated substances, air emissions and wastewater discharges exposes us to some risks of environmental liability, including the release of pollutants from oil and natural gas wells and associated equipment to the environment. The cost of compliance with these laws can be significant. Failure to properly handle, transport or dispose of these materials or otherwise conduct our operations in accordance with these and other environmental laws could expose us to substantial liability for administrative, civil and criminal penalties, cleanup and site restoration costs and liability associated with releases of such materials, damages to natural resources and other damages, as well as potentially impair our ability to conduct our operations. Such liability is commonly on a strict, joint and several liability basis, without regard to fault. Liability may be imposed as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Neighboring landowners and other third parties may file claims against us for personal injury or property damage allegedly caused by the release of pollutants into the environment. Environmental laws and regulations have changed in the past, and they may change in the future and become more stringent. For example, following the election of President Biden and Democratic control in both houses of Congress, it is possible that our operations may be subject to greater environmental, health and safety restrictions, particularly with regards to hydraulic fracturing, permitting and GHG emissions. Separately, current and future claims and liabilities may have a material adverse effect on us because of potential adverse outcomes, defense costs, diversion of management resources, unavailability of insurance coverage and other factors. The ultimate costs of these liabilities are difficult to determine and may exceed any reserves we may have established. If existing environmental requirements or enforcement policies change, we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures.\nOur and our customers\u2019 operations are subject to a series of risks arising out of the threat of climate change that could result in increased operating costs, limit the areas in which oil and natural gas production may occur, and reduce demand for the products and services we provide.\nThe threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and in foreign countries. Numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of GHGs as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions. As a result, our operations as well as the operations of our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers are subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation, and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of GHGs.\nIn the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level. However, following the U.S. Supreme Court finding that GHG emissions constitute a pollutant under the CAA, the EPA\nhas adopted regulations that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the United States and together with the DOT, implementing GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States. For example, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules that establish new air emission controls for methane emissions from certain new, modified, or reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission, and storage activities, otherwise known as Subpart OOOOa. The EPA finalized amendments to the 2016 standards in September 2020 that removed the transmission and storage segment from the oil and natural gas source category and rescinded the methane-specific requirements for production and processing facilities. However, several lawsuits have been filed challenging these amendments, and President Biden has called for the issuance of regulations that would restore the previous 2016 standards or the introduction of more stringent standards for the oil and gas sector.\nAdditionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, there is an agreement, the United Nations-sponsored \u201cParis Agreement,\u201d that requires nations to submit non-binding emissions reduction targets every five years after 2020. Although the United States had previously withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, President Biden has signed executive orders on his first day in office recommitting the United States to the agreement and calling for the federal government to begin formulating the United States\u2019 nationally determined emissions reduction targets under the agreement. However, the impacts of these executive orders, and the terms of any legislation or regulation to implement the United States\u2019 commitment under the Paris Agreement, are unclear at this time.\nGovernmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the United States, including climate-change-related pledges made by certain candidates for public office. On January 27, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that commits to substantial action on climate change, calling for, among other things, the increased use of zero-emissions vehicles by the federal government, the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry, and an increased emphasis on climate-related risk across government agencies and economic sectors. The executive order also suspends the issuance of new leases for oil and gas development on federal land; for more information, see our regulatory disclosure titled \u201cRegulation of Hydraulic Fracturing and Related Activities. Other actions that the Biden Administration may take include the imposition of more restrictive requirements for the development of pipeline infrastructure or LNG export facilities, or more restrictive GHG emissions limitations for oil and gas facilities. Litigation risks are also increasing as a number of cities and other local governments have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas companies in state or federal court, alleging among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to climate change or that such companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change but failed to adequately disclose those impacts to their investors or customers.\nThere are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers as shareholders currently invested in fossil-fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. There is also a risk that financial institutions will be required to adopt policies that have the effect of reducing the funding provided to the fossil fuel sector. Recently, the Federal Reserve announced that it has joined the Network for Greening the Financial System, a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector. Limitation of investments in and financings for fossil fuel energy companies could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of drilling programs or development or production activities.\nThe adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector or otherwise restrict the areas in which this sector may produce oil and natural gas or generate GHG emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, oil and natural gas, which could reduce demand for our services and products. Additionally, political, litigation and financial risks may result in our oil and natural gas customers restricting or cancelling production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes, or impairing their ability to continue to operate in an economic manner, which also could reduce demand for our services and products. One or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation\nMoreover, climate change may cause more extreme weather conditions and increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our operations and increase our costs, and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nOur hydraulic fracturing operations are a significant component of our business, and it is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly oil and natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has previously issued a series of rules under the CAA that establish new emission control requirements for emissions of volatile organic compounds and methane from certain oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations and equipment. Separately, the BLM finalized a rule governing hydraulic fracturing on federal lands but this rule was subsequently rescinded. Although several of these rulemakings have been rescinded or modified, new or stringent regulations may be promulgated by the Biden Administration. For example, on January 20, the Biden Administration\u2019s DOI issued an order that temporarily suspended the issuance of fossil fuel authorizations, including leases and permits, for a period of 60 days. Although the order specifies that it does not limit existing operations under valid leases, any restrictions for new or existing production activities on federal land could adversely impact our customers\u2019 operations, and consequently demand for our services. Further, legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing (except when diesel fuels are used) from the definition of \u201cunderground injection\u201d and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, have been proposed in recent sessions of Congress. Several states and local jurisdictions in which we or our customers operate also have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids.\nFederal and state governments have also investigated whether the disposal of produced water into underground injection wells has caused increased seismic activity in certain areas. In response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, Oklahoma has issued rules for wastewater disposal wells in 2014 that imposed certain permitting and operating restrictions and reporting requirements on disposal wells in proximity to faults and also, from time to time, has implemented plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations. In particular, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission released well completion seismicity guidelines for operators in the SCOOP and STACK require hydraulic fracturing operations to be suspended following earthquakes of certain magnitudes in the vicinity. In addition, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission\u2019s Oil and Gas Conservation Division has previously issued an order limiting future increases in the volume of oil and natural gas wastewater injected into the ground in an effort to reduce the number of earthquakes in the state. The Texas Railroad Commission has adopted similar rules.\nIncreased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and related activities could subject us and our customers to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, and plugging and abandonment requirements. New requirements could result in increased operational costs for us and our customers, and reduce the demand for our services.\nIncreasing trucking regulations may increase our costs and negatively impact our results of operations.\nIn connection with our business operations, including the transportation and relocation of our hydraulic fracturing equipment and shipment of frac sand, we operate trucks and other heavy equipment. As such, we operate as a motor carrier in providing certain of our services and therefore are subject to regulation by the DOT and by various state agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, driver licensing, insurance requirements, financial reporting and review of certain mergers, consolidations and acquisitions, and transportation of hazardous materials. Our trucking operations are subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may increase our costs. Some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations, changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time a driver may drive or work in any specific period, onboard black box recorder device requirements or limits on vehicle weight and size.\nInterstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the DOT. To a large degree, intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to state safety regulations that mirror federal regulations. Matters such as the weight and dimensions of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations. From time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, including proposals to increase federal, state, or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, which may increase our costs or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any increase in such taxes applicable to us will be enacted.\nCertain motor vehicle operators require registration with the DOT. This registration requires an acceptable operating record. The DOT periodically conducts compliance reviews and may revoke registration privileges based on certain safety performance criteria that could result in a suspension of operations.\nConservation measures, commercial development and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas and our services.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas, resulting in reduced demand for oilfield services. The impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe commercial development of economically-viable alternative energy sources and related products (such as electric vehicles, wind, solar, geothermal, tidal, fuel cells and biofuels) could have a similar effect. In addition, certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, including the allowance of percentage depletion for oil and natural gas properties, may be eliminated as a result of proposed legislation. Any future decreases in the rate at which oil and natural gas reserves are discovered or developed, whether due to the passage of legislation, increased governmental regulation leading to limitations, or prohibitions on exploration and drilling activity, including hydraulic fracturing, or other factors, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, even in a stronger oil and natural gas price environment.\nCertain of our completion services, particularly our hydraulic fracturing services, are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on our or our customers\u2019 ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWater is an essential component of unconventional shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Over the past several years, certain of the areas in which we and our customers operate have experienced extreme drought conditions and competition for water in such areas is growing. In addition, some state and local governmental authorities have begun to monitor or restrict the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to ensure adequate local water supply. For instance, some states require E&P companies to report certain information regarding the water they use for hydraulic fracturing and to monitor the quality of groundwater surrounding some wells stimulated by hydraulic fracturing. Generally, our water requirements are met by our customers from sources on or near their sites, but there is no assurance that our customers will be able to obtain a sufficient supply of water from sources in these areas. Our or our customers\u2019 inability to obtain water from local sources or to effectively utilize flowback water could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to our Tax Matters\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTCJA\u201d) included a reduction to the maximum deduction allowed for net operating losses generated in tax years after December 31, 2017 and the elimination of carrybacks of net operating losses. Under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, which modified the TCJA, U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) generated in taxable periods beginning after December 31, 2017, may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such NOLs in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020, is limited to 80% of taxable income. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $397.4 million of federal NOLs, some of which will begin to expire in 2035. Approximately $229.5 million of our federal NOLs relate to pre-2018 periods. As of December 31, 2020, our state net operating losses were approximately $51.0 million and will begin to expire in 2024.\nUtilization of these NOLs depends on many factors, including our future income, which cannot be assured. In addition, Section 382 (\u201cSection 382\u201d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income that may be offset by NOLs when a corporation has undergone an\n\u201cownership change\u201d (as determined under Section 382). Generally, a change of more than 50% in the ownership of a corporation\u2019s stock, by value, over a three-year period constitutes an ownership change for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any unused annual limitation may, subject to certain limitations, be carried over to later years. We may experience ownership changes, which may result in annual limitation under Section 382 determined by multiplying the value of our stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate as defined in Section 382, increased under certain circumstances as a result of recognizing built-in gains in our assets existing at the time of the ownership change. The limitations arising from ownership changes may prevent utilization of our NOLs prior to their expiration. Future ownership changes or regulatory changes could further limit our ability to utilize our NOLs. To the extent we are not able to offset our future income with our NOLs, this could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows if we attain profitability.\nRisks Inherent to an Investment in our Common Stock\nWe are subject to certain requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404\u201d). If we fail to comply with the requirements of Section 404 or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, our investors may lose confidence in our reported information and our stock price may be negatively affected.\nWe are required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404, which requires that we document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue our management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. This section also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm issue an attestation report on such internal control.\nIf we fail to comply with the requirements of Section 404, or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers, reduce our ability to obtain financing and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and stockholder rights plan, as well as Delaware law, may discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval. If our Board elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our shareholders, including:\n\u2022limitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022limitations on the ability of our shareholders to call special meetings;\n\u2022advance notice provisions for shareholder proposals and nominations for elections to the Board to be acted upon at meetings of shareholders;\n\u2022providing that the Board is expressly authorized to adopt, or to alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022establishing advance notice and certain information requirements for nominations for election to our Board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at shareholder meetings.\nIn addition, our Board adopted a short-term stockholder rights plan (currently scheduled to expire on March 31, 2021) that would likely discourage a hostile attempt to acquire control of us.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist shareholders.\nPublicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by investors seeking to increase shareholder value by advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases, sales of assets or even sale of the entire company. Given our shareholder composition and other factors,\nit is possible such shareholders or future activist shareholders may attempt to effect such changes or acquire control over us. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by such activist shareholders or others in the future would be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our Board and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of shareholder activism or changes to the composition of the Board may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business, instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. If customers choose to delay, defer or reduce transactions with us or transact with our competitors instead of us because of any such issues, then our business, financial condition, revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our shareholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein.\nThe exclusive forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. To the extent that any such claims may be based upon federal law claims, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.\nThe enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 certificates of incorporation or similar governing documents has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable, including with respect to claims arising under the U.S. federal securities laws.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of our certificate of incorporation regarding exclusive forum. This choice of forum provision may limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe market price of our common stock is subject to volatility.\nThe market of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, and the level of trading of our common stock may be affected by, numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among other things, our limited trading volume, the concentration of holdings or our common stock, actual or anticipated variations in our operating results and cash flow, the nature and content of our earnings releases, announcements or events that impact our products, customers, competitors or markets, business conditions in our markets and the general state of the securities markets and the market for energy-related stocks, as well as general economic and market conditions and other factors that may affect our future results, including those described in this report. Significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, by significant shareholders, officers or directors could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThere may be future sales or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional common stock, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent a right to receive, common stock. Any issuance of additional shares of our common stock or convertible securities will dilute the ownership interest of our common stockholders. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity-related securities in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 16617, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "PUMP"}
