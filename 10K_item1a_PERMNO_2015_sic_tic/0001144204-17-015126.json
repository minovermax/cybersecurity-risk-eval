{"cik": "1575793", "company": "Energous Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe are subject to many risks that may harm our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. This discussion highlights some of the risks that might adversely affect our future operating results in material ways. We believe these are the risks and uncertainties that are the most important ones we face. We cannot be certain that we will successfully address these risks, and if we are unable to address them, our business may not grow, our stock price may suffer and you could lose the value of your investment in our company. Other risks and uncertainties that we do not currently recognize as material risks, or that are similar to risks faced by other companies in our industry, may also impair our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. The risks discussed below include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from what is in these forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOther than engineering services revenues, we have no history of generating revenue, have a history of operating losses, and we may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have a limited operating history upon which investors may rely in evaluating our business and its prospects. We have generated only very limited revenues to date and we have a history of losses from operations. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $125 million. Our ability to generate revenues on a more reliable and larger scale, and to achieve profitability, will depend on our ability to execute our business plan, complete the development of our technology, and incorporate it into products that customers wish to buy, and to do so rapidly with appropriate financing if necessary. If we are unable to generate revenues of significant scale to cover our costs of doing business, our losses will continue and we may not achieve profitability, which could negatively impact the value of your investment in our securities.\nTerms of our Development and License Agreement with a tier-one consumer electronics company could inhibit potential licensees from working with us in specific markets.\nWe have entered into a Development and License Agreement with a tier-one consumer electronics company to embed our WattUp wire-free charging receiver and transmitter technology in various products, including mobile consumer electronics and related accessories. This agreement provides our strategic partner a time-to-market advantage during the development and until one year after the first customer shipment for specified consumer WattUp-enabled products. This may inhibit other potential licensees of our technology from engaging with us and may cause them to seek solutions offered by other companies, which could have a negative impact on our revenue opportunities and financial results.\nWe may be unable to demonstrate the feasibility of our technology.\nWe have developed working prototypes of products using our technology, but additional research and development is required to commercialize our technology for mid field and far field applications so that it can be successfully integrated into commercial products. Our research and development efforts remain subject to the risks associated with the development of new products that are based on emerging technologies, such as unanticipated technical problems, the inability to identify products utilizing our technology that will be in demand with customers, getting our technology designed in to those products, designing new products for manufacturability, and achieving acceptable price points for final products. Any delays in developing our technology that arise from factors of this sort would aggravate our exposure to the risk of having inadequate capital to fund the research and development needed to complete development of these products. Technical problems causing delays would cause us to incur additional expenses that would increase our operating losses. If we experience significant delays in developing our technology and products based on it for use in potential commercial applications, particularly after incurring significant expenditures, our business may fail and you could lose the value of your investment in our company. To our knowledge, the technological concepts we are applying have never previously been successfully applied. If we fail to develop practical and economical commercial products based on our technology, our business may fail and you could lose the value of your investment in our stock.\nThe FCC may deny approval for our technology, and future legislative or regulatory changes may impair our business.\nOur wire-free charging technology involves transmission of power using radio frequency energy, which is subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, and may be subject to regulation by other federal, state and local agencies. We intend to design our technology to operate in a frequency band that is also used for Wi-Fi routers and other wireless consumer electronics. Different customer applications may require us to develop our technology to work at different frequencies. For those products, the FCC grants product approval if, among other things, the human exposure to radio frequency emissions is below specified thresholds. For some of our products that transmit more power, additional FCC approvals would be required. We received an initial approval for near field charging technology in 2016. There is no guarantee that additional FCC approvals that may be necessary to commercialize our technology will be obtained. To our knowledge, the transmission of power using RF energy by a consumer product at the ranges and power levels we are proposing has not previously been approved by the FCC. There can be no assurance that devices incorporating our technology will be able to obtain FCC approval or that other governmental approvals will not be required. Our efforts to have devices using our technology to be authorized by the FCC could be costly and time consuming, making it more difficult to achieve our business plan. If manufacturers of these products are unable to receive required approvals in a timely and cost-efficient manner, our technology may be used less often and our business and operating results could be materially harmed. The cost of compliance with new laws or regulations governing our technology could adversely affect our revenues and financial results. Any such new laws or regulations could impose restrictions or obligations on us that could require us to redesign our technology or future products, and may impose restrictions that are difficult or impracticable to comply with, which could harm our business and operating results.\nWe are currently dependent upon our strategic relationship with Dialog Semiconductor, a provider of electronics products, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve the expected benefits of this relationship.\nWe have entered into a strategic cooperation agreement with Dialog Semiconductor, a provider of electronics products, pursuant to which we licensed our WattUp technology to Dialog and it became the exclusive provider of our technology. We intend to leverage Dialog\u2019s sales and distribution channels and its operational capabilities to accelerate market adoption of our technology, while we focus our resources on research and development of our technology. There can be no assurance that Dialog will promote our technology successfully, or that it will be successful in producing and distributing products containing our technology to our customers\u2019 specifications. Dialog may have other priorities or may encounter difficulties in its own business that interfere with the success of our relationship. If this strategic relationship does not work as we intend, then we may be required to seek an arrangement with another strategic partner, or to develop internal capabilities, which will require a commitment of management time and our financial resources to identify a replacement strategic partner, or to develop our own production and distribution capabilities. As a result, we may be unable without undue expense to replace this agreement with one or more new strategic relationships to promote and provide our technology to end users.\nWe may require additional financing in order to achieve our business plans, and there is no guarantee that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe believe our technology is novel and promising in offering, but the electronics industry in general - and the power, recharging and alternative recharging segments of that industry in particular - are subject to intense competition and new technologies often emerge to dominate other technologies. Accordingly, for our business plans to succeed we believe it will be important for us to move quickly to develop our technology, obtain required regulatory approvals and engage with strategic partners. As a small company, we may be unable to successfully implement our ambitions of targeting large markets in a competitive industry segment without significantly increasing our resources. We may not have sufficient funds to fully implement our business plan. While we believe our current cash on hand, together with anticipated payments received under product development projects entered into with customers, will be sufficient to fund our operations through 2017. Depending on how soon we are able to begin to generate meaningful commercial revenue we may need to raise capital through new financings. Such financings could include equity financing, which may be dilutive to stockholders, or debt financing, which could restrict our ability to borrow from other sources. In addition, such securities may contain rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of current stockholders. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available on terms attractive to us, or at all, which may require us to curtail development of our technology or reduce our operations. We could be forced to sell or dispose of our rights or assets we may have. Accordingly, if we are not able to raise adequate funds on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition, including the possibility that a lack of funds could cause our business to fail and liquidate with little or no return to investors.\nWe may have difficulty managing growth in our business.\nExpanding our activities as we intend will increase the demands on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. If we do not upgrade our technical, administrative, operating and financial control systems, or the unexpected expansion difficulties arise, including issues relating to our research and development activities and retention of experienced scientists, managers and engineers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, our results of operations and financial condition, and our ability to timely execute our business plan. If we are unable to implement these actions in a timely manner, our results may be adversely affected.\nIf products incorporating our technology are launched commercially but do not achieve widespread market acceptance, we will not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our business.\nAcceptance of a wire-free charging system as a preferred method to recharge low-power fixed and mobile electronic devices will be crucial to our continued success. Consumers and commercial customers will not begin to use or increase the use of products incorporating our technology unless they agree that the convenience of our wire-free charging solution would be worth the additional expense of purchasing such products. These and other factors, including the following factors, may affect the rate and level of market acceptance of products in our industry:\n\u2022 the price of products incorporating our technology relative to other products or competing methods of recharging;\n\u2022 the effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts of our commercialization partners;\n\u2022 the support and rate of acceptance of our technology and solutions with our joint development partners;\n\u2022 Perception, by individual and enterprise users, of our wire-free charging solution\u2019s convenience, safety, efficiency and benefits compared to competing methods of recharging;\n\u2022 press and blog coverage, social media coverage, and other publicity and public relations factors which are not within our control; and\n\u2022 regulatory developments related to our solution or their inclusion in others\u2019 products.\nIf we are unable to achieve or maintain market acceptance of our technology and related products, our business would be significantly harmed.\nIf products incorporating our technology are commercially launched, we may experience seasonality or other unevenness in our financial results in consumer markets or a long and variable sales cycle in enterprise markets.\nWhile we do not now have license revenue, , our strategy depends on the development of successful commercial products and effectively licensing our technology into the consumer, enterprise and commercial markets. We will need to understand procurement and buying cycles to be successful in licensing our technology into those markets. We anticipate it is possible that demand for our technology could vary similarly with the market for products with which our technology may be used, for example, the market for new purchases of laptops, tablet, mobile phones, gaming systems, toys, wearables and the like. Such consumer markets are often seasonal, with peaks in and around the December holiday season and the August-September back-to-school season. Enterprises and commercial markets may have annual or other budgeting and buying cycles that could affect us, and, particularly if we are designated as a capital improvement project, we may have a long or unpredictable sales cycle.\nWe may not be able to achieve all the features we seek to include in our technology.\nWe have developed working prototypes of commercial products that utilize our technology. Additional features and performance specifications we seek to include in our technology have not yet been developed. For example, certain customer applications may require specific combinations of cost, footprint, efficiencies and capabilities at various charging power levels and distances as part of an overall system. We believe our research and development efforts will yield additional functionality and capabilities over time. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving all the features we are targeting and our inability to do so may limit the appeal of our technology to consumers.\nUse of our technology or other future products based on our technology may require the user to purchase additional products to use with existing devices. To the extent these additional purchases are inconvenient, the adoption of our technology under development or other future products could be slowed, which would harm our business.\nFor rechargeable devices that utilize our receiver technology, the technology may be embedded in a sleeve, case or other enclosure. For example, products such as remote controls or toys equipped with replaceable AA size or other batteries would need to be outfitted with enhanced batteries and other hardware enabling the devices to be rechargeable by our system. In each case, an end user would be required to retrofit the device with a receiver and may be required to upgrade the battery technology used with the device (unless, for example, compatible battery technology and a receiver are built into the device). These additional steps and expenses may offset the convenience for some users and discourage some users from purchasing our technology under development or other future products. Such factors may inhibit adoption of our technology, which could harm our business. We have not developed an enhanced battery for use in devices with our technology, and our ability to enable use of our technology with devices that require an enhanced battery will depend on our ability to develop a commercial version of such a battery that could be manufactured at a reasonable cost. If we fail to develop or enable a commercially practicable enhanced battery, our business could be harmed, and we may need to change our strategy and target markets.\nLaboratory conditions differ from field conditions, which could affect the effectiveness of our technology under development or other future products. Failures to move from laboratory to the field effectively would harm our business.\nWhen used in the field, our technology may not perform as expected based on test results and performance of our technology under controlled laboratory circumstances. For example, in the laboratory a configuration of obstructions of transmission will be arranged in some fashion, but in the field receivers may be obstructed in many different and unpredictable ways over which we have no control. These conditions may significantly diminish the power received at the receiver or the effective range of the transmitter, because the RF energy from the transmitter may be absorbed by obscuring or blocking material or may need to be reflected off a surface to reach the receiver, making the transmission distance longer than straight-line distances. The failure of products using our technology or other future products to be able to meet the demands of users in the field could harm our business.\nSafety concerns and legal action by private parties may affect our business.\nWe believe that our technology is safe. However, it is possible that we could discover safety issues with our technology or that some people may be concerned with wire-free transmission of power in a manner that has occurred with some other wireless technologies as they were put into residential and commercial use, such as the safety concerns that were raised by some regarding the use of cellular telephones and other devices to transmit data wirelessly in close proximity to the human body. While we plan to at least partially address this potential concern by developing our management software and sensor technology to be configurable by users to selectively recharge devices in ways that would be intended to avoid recharging in close proximity to a human body, such as recharging only during predetermined time periods or recharging only when the device is not moving, we do not plan to conduct any tests to determine whether RF waves produce harmful effects on humans or other animals. We may be unable to effectively prevent recharging in close proximity to a user\u2019s body, which could affect the marketability of our technology or could result in requests for law or regulation governing our technology under development or a class of products in which our technology under development would be included. In addition, while we believe our technology is safe, users of our technology under development or other future products who suffer medical ailments may blame the use of products incorporating our technology, as occurred with a small number of users of cellular telephones. A discovery of safety issues relating to our technology could have a material adverse effect on our business and any legal action against us claiming our technology caused harm could be expensive, divert management and adversely affect us or cause our business to fail, whether or not such legal actions were ultimately successful.\nOur industry is subject to intense competition and rapid technological change, which may result in products or new solutions that are superior to our technology under development or other future products we may bring to market from time to time. If we are unable to anticipate or keep pace with changes in the marketplace and the direction of technological innovation and customer demands, our technology and products may become less useful or obsolete and our operating results will suffer.\nThe consumer and commercial electronics industry in general and the power, recharging and alternative recharging segments of that industry in particular are subject to intense and increasing competition and rapidly evolving technologies. Because products incorporating our technology are expected to have long development cycles, we must anticipate changes in the marketplace and the direction of technological innovation and customer demands. To compete successfully, we will need to demonstrate the advantages of our products and technologies over well-established alternative solutions, products and technologies, as well as newer methods of power delivery and convince consumers and enterprises of the advantages of our products and technologies. Traditional wall plug-in recharging remains an inexpensive alternative to our technology under development. Also, directly competing technologies such as inductive charging, magnetic resonance charging, conductive charging, ultrasound and other yet unidentified solutions may have greater consumer acceptance than the technologies we have developed. Furthermore, certain competitors may have greater resources than us and may be better established in the market than we are. We cannot be certain which other companies may have already decided to or may in the future choose to enter our markets. For example, consumer electronics products companies may invest substantial resources in wireless power or other recharging technologies and may decide to enter our target markets. Successful developments of competitors that result in new approaches for recharging could reduce the attractiveness of our products and technologies or render them obsolete.\nOur future success will depend in large part on our ability to establish and maintain a competitive position in current and future technologies. Rapid technological development may render our technology under development or future products based on our technology obsolete. Many of our competitors have greater corporate, financial, operational, sales and marketing resources than we have, as well as more experience in research and development. We cannot assure you that our competitors will not succeed in developing or marketing technologies or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our products or that would render our technologies and products obsolete. We may not have or be able to raise or develop the financial resources, technical expertise, marketing, distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future. Our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with our technologies.\nOur competitive position also depends on our ability to:\n\u2022 generate widespread awareness, acceptance and adoption by the consumer and enterprise markets of our technology under development and future products;\n\u2022 design a product that may be sold at an acceptable price point;\n\u2022 develop new or enhanced technologies or features that improve the convenience, efficiency, safety or perceived safety, and productivity of our technology under development and future products;\n\u2022 properly identify customer needs and deliver new products or product enhancements to address those needs;\n\u2022 limit the time required from proof of feasibility to routine production;\n\u2022 limit the timing and cost of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022 attract and retain qualified personnel;\n\u2022 protect our inventions with patents or otherwise develop proprietary products and processes; and\n\u2022 secure sufficient capital resources to expand both our continued research and development, and sales and marketing efforts.\nIf our technology is not competitive based on these or other factors, our business could be harmed.\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to obtain, maintain and protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in products incorporating our technologies. Patents and other proprietary rights provide uncertain protections, and we may be unable to protect our intellectual property. For example, we may be unsuccessful in defending our patents and other proprietary rights against third party challenges. If we do not have the resources to defend our intellectual property, the value of our intellectual property and our licensed technology will decline, threatening our potential revenue and results of operations.\nWe have in excess of 250 pending U.S. patents and provisional patent applications on file. The PTO issued our first twenty-two patents and notified us of the allowance of ten additional patents to protect our technology.\nIn addition to patents, we expect to rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical security measures to protect our intellectual property rights. These measures may not be adequate to safeguard our technology. If they do not protect our rights adequately, third parties could use our technology, and our ability to compete in the market would be reduced. Although we are attempting to obtain patent coverage for our technology where available and where we believe appropriate, there are aspects of the technology for which patent coverage may never be sought or received. We may not possess the resources to or may not choose to pursue patent protection outside the United States or any or every country other than the United States where we may eventually decide to sell our future products. Our ability to prevent others from making or selling duplicate or similar technologies will be impaired in those countries in which we have no patent protection. Although we have in excess of 250 pending and provisional patent applications on file in the United States protecting aspects of our technology under development, our patents may not issue as a result of those applications drawing priority or otherwise based on those patent applications, may issue only with limited coverage or may issue and be subsequently successfully challenged by others and held invalid or unenforceable.\nSimilarly, even if patents do issue based on our applications or future applications, any issued patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages. Competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop products that provide outcomes comparable or superior to ours. Our patents may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges by third parties, and others may challenge the inventorship or ownership of our patents and pending patent applications. In addition, if we choose to and are able to secure protection in countries outside the United States, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. In the event a competitor infringes upon our patent or other intellectual property rights, enforcing those rights may be difficult and time consuming. Even if successful, litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenge could be expensive and time consuming and could divert our management\u2019s attention. We may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against a challenge.\nOur strategy is to deploy our technology into the market, license patent and other proprietary rights to aspects of our technology to third parties and customers. Disputes with our licensors may arise regarding the scope and content of these licenses. Further, our ability to expand into additional fields with our technologies may be restricted by existing licenses or licenses we may grant to third parties in the future.\nThe policies we use to protect our trade secrets may not be effective in preventing misappropriation of our trade secrets by others. In addition, confidentiality agreements executed by our employees, consultants and advisors may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure. Litigating a trade secret claim is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge methods and know-how. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be unable to prevent competitors from using our own inventions and intellectual property to compete against us, and our business may be harmed.\nWe may be subject to patent infringement or other intellectual property lawsuits that could be costly to defend.\nBecause our industry is characterized by competing intellectual property, we may become involved in litigation based on claims that we have violated the intellectual property rights of others. Determining whether a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues, and the outcome of patent litigation actions is often uncertain. No assurance can be given that third party patents containing claims covering our products, parts of our products, technology or methods do not exist, have not been filed, or could not be filed or issued. Because of the number of patents issued and patent applications filed in our technical areas or fields (including some pertaining specifically to wireless charging technologies), our competitors or other third parties may assert that our products and technology and the methods we employ in the use of our products and technology are covered by United States or foreign patents held by them. In addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue and because publication schedules for pending applications vary by jurisdiction, there may be applications now pending which may result in issued patents that our technology under development or other future products would infringe. Also, because the claims of published patent applications can change between publication and patent grant, there may be published patent applications that may ultimately issue with claims that we infringe. There could also be existing patents that one or more of our technologies, products or parts may infringe and of which we are unaware. As the number of competitors in the market for wire-free power and alternative recharging solutions increases, and as the number of patents issued in this area grows, the possibility of patent infringement claims against us increases. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations.\nIn the event that we become subject to a patent infringement or other intellectual property lawsuit and if the relevant patents or other intellectual property were upheld as valid and enforceable and we were found to infringe or violate the terms of a license to which we are a party, we could be prevented from selling any infringing products of ours unless we could obtain a license or were able to redesign the product to avoid infringement. If we were unable to obtain a license or successfully redesign, we might be prevented from selling our technology under development or other future products. If there is a determination that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of a competitor or other person, we may be required to pay damages, pay a settlement, or pay ongoing royalties, or be enjoined. In these circumstances, we may be unable to sell our products or license our technology at competitive prices or at all, and our business and operating results could be harmed.\nWe could become subject to product liability claims, product recalls, and warranty claims that could be expensive, divert management\u2019s attention and harm our business.\nOur business exposes us to potential liability risks that are inherent in the marketing and sale of products used by consumers. We may be held liable if our technology under development now or in the future causes injury or death or are found otherwise unsuitable during usage. Our technology under development incorporates sophisticated components and computer software. Complex software can contain errors, particularly when first introduced. In addition, new products or enhancements may contain undetected errors or performance problems that, despite testing, are discovered only after installation. While we believe our technology is safe, users could allege or possibly prove defects (some of which could be alleged or proved to cause harm to users or others) because we design our technology to perform complex functions involving RF energy, possibly in close proximity to users. A product liability claim, regardless of its merit or eventual outcome, could result in significant legal defense costs. The coverage limits of our insurance policies we may choose to purchase to cover related risks may not be adequate to cover future claims. If sales of products incorporating our technology increase or we suffer future product liability claims, we may be unable to maintain product liability insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or with adequate amounts. A product liability claim, any product recalls or excessive warranty claims, whether arising from defects in design or manufacture or otherwise, could negatively affect our sales or require a change in the design or manufacturing process, any of which could harm our reputation and business, harm our relationship with licensors of our products, result in a decline in revenue and harm our business.\nIn addition, if a product that we or a strategic partner design is defective, whether due to design or manufacturing defects, improper use of the product or other reasons, we or our strategic partners may be required to notify regulatory authorities and/or to recall the product. A required notification to a regulatory authority or recall could result in an investigation by regulatory authorities of products incorporating our technology, which could in turn result in required recalls, restrictions on the sale of such products or other penalties. The adverse publicity resulting from any of these actions could adversely affect the perception of our customers and potential customers. These investigations or recalls, especially if accompanied by unfavorable publicity, could result in our incurring substantial costs, losing revenues and damaging our reputation, each of which would harm our business.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our utilization of consultants.\nTo improve productivity and accelerate our development efforts while we build out our own engineering team, we use experienced consultants to assist in selected business functions, including the development of our ICs. We take steps to monitor and regulate the performance of these independent third parties. However, arrangements with third party service providers may make our operations vulnerable if these consultants fail to satisfy their obligations to us as a result of their performance, changes in their own operations, financial condition, or other matters outside of our control. Effective management of our consultants is important to our business and strategy. The failure of our consultants to perform as anticipated could result in substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention from other strategic activities, or create other operational or financial problems for us. Terminating or transitioning arrangements with key consultants could result in additional costs and a risk of operational delays, potential errors and possible control issues as a result of the termination or during the transition.\nWe expect to depend on consumer electronics supply chain firms to manufacture and market products using our technology. If these firms fail to successfully manufacture, market and distribute our technology under development, our business and results of operations will be materially harmed.\nWe intend to license our system architecture, proprietary waveform, antenna designs to consumer electronics supply chain firms, rather than manufacture our technology ourselves. We will not be able to control the efforts and resources these consumer electronics supply chain firms devote to marketing our technology under development or other future products. Those firms may not be able to successfully market and sell the products they develop based on our technology, may not devote sufficient time and resources to support the marketing and selling efforts, and may not market those products at prices that will permit the products to develop, achieve or sustain market acceptance. Finding new licensors could be an expensive and time-consuming process and we may not be able to find suitable consumer electronics supply chain firms and other distribution strategic partners on acceptable terms or at all. If we cannot find suitable third party partners or our third-party partners experience difficulties, do not actively market our technology under development or future products or do not otherwise perform under our license agreements, our potential for revenue may be dramatically reduced, and our business could be harmed.\nWe intend to pursue licensing of our technology as a primary means of commercialization but we may not be able to secure advantageous license agreements. If we are not able to secure advantageous license agreements, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe are pursuing the licensing of our technology as a primary means of commercialization. We believe there are many companies that would be interested in implementing our technology into their devices. Many of these companies are well-known, world-wide companies. We have entered into one product development and license agreement with a tier-one consumer electronics company that has the potential to yield license revenue. In addition, we have also entered into a number of evaluation and joint development agreements with potential strategic partners. However, these agreements do not commit either party to a long-term relationship and any of these parties may disengage with us at any time. Creating a license or other business relationship with these classes of companies will take a substantial effort, as we expect to have to convince them of the efficacy of our technology, meet their design and manufacturing requirements, satisfy their marketing and product needs, and comply with their selection, review and contracting requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to gain entry to these companies, or that they will ultimately decide to integrate our technology with their products. We may not be able to secure license agreements with customers on terms that are advantageous to us. Furthermore, the timing and volume of revenue earned from license agreements will be outside of our control. If the license agreements we enter into do not prove to be advantageous to us, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to develop a technology that meets the specifications required by our Development and License Agreement with our tier-one consumer products company customer. Even if we succeed in developing a technology that meets all the specifications, this customer could decline to use our technology in its products. Any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe terms of our Development and License Agreement with a tier-one consumer products company require us to meet stringent performance specifications and aggressive technical milestones. While we are devoting substantial corporate time and resources to the development of our technology for this company\u2019s products, there can be no assurance that we can meet the performance specifications and technical milestones in the timeframe required by the Development and License Agreement or at all. Further, the decision to embed our technology within its products is completely in our development partner\u2019s discretion and it could decline to use our technology in its products even if we meet all the performance specifications and technical milestones set forth in the agreement. Additionally, the Development and License Agreement prohibits us from the development of our technology for certain product categories until one year following our development partner\u2019s introduction of products with our technology embedded in those categories to consumers. If we are unable to meet the stringent performance specifications and aggressive technical milestones required by the Development and License Agreement or our development partner declines to embed our technology in its products, our business could be significantly harmed in the absence of additional license agreements that equal or exceed the potential of this agreement. The harm to our business resulting from either of these scenarios will exacerbated by the fact that we have agreed to limited exclusivity in certain product categories with our development partner.\nWe are highly dependent on key members of our executive management team. Our inability to retain these individuals could impede our business plan and growth strategies, which could have a negative impact on our business and the value of your investment.\nOur ability to implement our business plan depends, to a critical extent, on the continued efforts and services of a very small number of key executives. If we lose the services of any of these persons, we would be required to expend significant time and money in the pursuit of replacements, which may result in a delay in the implementation of our business plan and plan of operations. We can give no assurance that we could find satisfactory replacements for these individuals on terms that would not be unduly expensive or burdensome to us. We do not currently carry a key-man life insurance policy that would assist us in recouping our costs in the event of the death or disability of any of these executives.\nOur success and growth depend on our ability to attract, integrate and retain high-level engineering talent.\nBecause of the highly specialized and complex nature of our business, our success depends on our ability to attract, hire, train, integrate and retain high-level engineering talent. Competition for such personnel is intense because we compete for talent against many large profitable companies and our inability to adequately staff our operations with highly qualified and well-trained engineers could render us less efficient and impede our ability to develop and deliver a commercial product. Such a competitive market could put upward pressure on labor costs for engineering talent. We may incur significant costs to attract and retain highly qualified talent, and we may lose new employees to our competitors or other technology companies before we realize the benefit of our investment in recruiting and training them. Volatility or lack of performance in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nYou may lose all of your investment.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. As an investor, you may never recoup all, or even part of, your investment and you may never realize any return on your investment. You must be prepared to lose all of your investment.\nOur stock price could be volatile and investors may have difficulty selling their shares.\nOur common stock is currently listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol \u201cWATT.\u201d For the period from March 28, 2014 when trading began on The NASDAQ Stock Market through March 6, 2017, the daily trading volume for shares of our common stock ranged from 6,200 to 6,288,000 shares traded per day, and the average daily trading volume during such period was approximately 394,000 shares.\nThe market price of the common stock has fluctuated significantly since it was first listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market on March 28, 2014. Since this date, through March 6, 2017, the intra-day trading price has fluctuated from a low of $3.65 to a high of $20.55. The price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022 actual or anticipated variations in operating results;\n\u2022 the limited number of holders of the common stock;\n\u2022 changes in the economic performance and/or market valuations of other technology companies;\n\u2022 our announcements of significant strategic partnerships or other events;\n\u2022 announcements by other companies in the wire-free charging space;\n\u2022 articles published or rumors circulated by third parties regarding our business, technology or development partners;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u2022 sales or other transactions involving our capital stock, including sales that may occur following the termination of applicable lock-up periods.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and are able to take advantage of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act, and, for as long as we continue to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and have no immediate plans to pay dividends.\nWe plan to reinvest all of our earnings, to the extent we have earnings, in order to market our products and technology and to cover operating costs and to otherwise become and remain competitive. We do not plan to pay any cash dividends with respect to our securities in the foreseeable future. We cannot assure you that we would, at any time, generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock as a dividend.\nConcentration of ownership among our existing executive officers, directors and significant stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nAll decisions with respect to the management of our company are made by our board of directors and our officers, who beneficially own approximately 8% of our common stock collectively. In addition, other greater than 5% stockholders such as DvineWave which beneficially owned approximately 7.7% of our common stock as of December 31, 2016 and Ascend Capital LLC and its affiliates, which beneficially owned approximately 17.8% of our common stock. As a result, these stockholders will be able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant costs as a result of being a public reporting company and our management will be required to devote substantial time to meet our compliance obligations.\nAs a public reporting company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. We are subject to reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) that require us to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and financial controls, as well as some specific corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel are expected to devote a substantial amount of time to compliance initiatives associated with our public reporting company status.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nOur stock price has fluctuated in the past and may be volatile in the future. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation, and we may be the target of litigation of this sort in the future. Securities litigation is costly and can divert management attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business and the value of your investment in our company.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be maintained.\nOur stock is currently traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market, but we can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain an active trading market on The NASDAQ Stock Market or any other exchange in the future. If an active market for our common stock is not maintained, it may be difficult for our stockholders to sell shares without depressing the market price for the shares or at all. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. There can be no assurance that analysts will continue to cover us or provide favorable coverage. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or change their opinion of our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover that stockholders consider favorable.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and applicable Delaware law, may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control or change in our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. The provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u2022 authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and to designate the rights, preferences and privileges of each class; if issued, such preferred stock would increase the number of outstanding shares of our capital stock and could include terms that may deter an acquisition of us;\n\u2022 limit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u2022 do not permit stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022 do not provide for cumulative voting rights; and\n\u2022 provide that all vacancies may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may limit our ability to engage in any business combination with a person who beneficially owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock unless certain conditions are satisfied. This restriction lasts for a period of three years following the share acquisition. These provisions may have the effect of entrenching our management team and may deprive you of the opportunity to sell your shares to potential acquirers at a premium over prevailing prices. This potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 14556, "SIC": 3690, "TIC": "WATT"}
