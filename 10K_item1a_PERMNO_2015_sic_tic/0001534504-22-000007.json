The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows would likely suffer. In that case, the trading price of PBF Energy Class A common stock could fall.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic significantly and adversely affected our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations starting in the first quarter of 2020. While we have seen the demand for our products return in 2021, there can be no assurance that our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations will revert to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels going forward.\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic starting in the first quarter of 2020, negatively impacted, and may continue to impact, worldwide economic and commercial activity and financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic, and variants thereof, and the related governmental responses resulted in significant business and operational disruptions, including business and school closures, supply chain disruptions, travel restrictions, stay-at-home orders and limitations on the availability of workforces, inclusive of mandatory quarantine periods, and has resulted in significantly lower global demand for refined petroleum and petrochemical products. Although demand for these products started to recover throughout the year ended December 31, 2021 following the lifting or easing of certain restrictions and the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and other protective measures, there can be no assurance that future periods will not be negatively impacted by the continuing effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, including resurgences and variants of the virus.\nIn addition, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has created simultaneous shocks in oil supply and demand resulting in an economic challenge to our industry which has not occurred since our formation. It is impossible to estimate the duration or significance of the financial impact that will result from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity will depend largely on future developments, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and variants thereof, particularly within the geographic areas where we operate, the effectiveness of vaccine programs, and the related impact on overall economic activity, all of which cannot be predicted with certainty at this time.\nWe continue to work with federal, state and local health authorities to respond to COVID-19 cases in the regions we operate and are taking or supporting measures to try to limit the spread of the virus and to mitigate the burden on the healthcare system. Many of these measures will continue to have an adverse impact on our business and financial results that we are not currently able to fully quantify. For example, we are carefully\nevaluating projects and non-essential work at our refineries. Based on market conditions, our refineries have been operating at reduced rates, while constantly monitoring and adjusting our production to correlate to increases in product demand. We lowered our capital program for 2021 and will continue to plan to do so in 2022 as compared to historic levels. We have planned a level of capital expenditures we believe will allow us to satisfy and comply with all required safety, environmental and planned regulatory capital commitments and other regulatory requirements, although there are no assurances that we will be able to continue to do so. Non-compliance with applicable environmental and safety requirements, including as a result of reduced staff due to an outbreak at one of our refineries, may impair our operations, may subject us to fines or penalties assessed by governmental authorities and/or may result in an environmental or safety incident. We may also be subject to liability as a result of claims against us by impacted workers or third parties.\nDemand for our refined products can significantly decline due to changes in global and regional economic conditions.\nBusiness closings and layoffs in the markets we operate have adversely affected demand for our refined products. Deterioration of general economic conditions or weak demand levels could require additional actions on our part to lower our operating costs, including temporarily or permanently ceasing to operate units at our facilities, as experienced in 2020 in the case of the East Coast Refining Reconfiguration. There may be significant incremental costs associated with such actions. Further deterioration of global and regional economic conditions may harm our liquidity and ability to repay our outstanding debt and the trading price of PBF Energy\u2019s Class A common stock.\nThe persistence or worsening or market conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations and operate our business.\nOur borrowing base under PBF Holding\u2019s asset-based revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) could be reduced if market conditions deteriorate or crude prices decrease significantly. Our borrowing base availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $3,400.0 million as of December 31, 2021. If current market conditions return to levels experienced during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, or worsen, we may require additional capital to meet our obligations as well as to operate our business, and additional financing and/or assets sales may not be possible on favorable terms or at all. Potential economic factors resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, which could lead to increasing unemployment rates, substantially reduced travel and reduced business and consumer spending, could also affect our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nThe price volatility of crude oil, other feedstocks, blendstocks, refined products and fuel and utility services may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur profitability, cash flows and liquidity from operations depend primarily on the margin above operating expenses (including the cost of refinery feedstocks, such as crude oil, intermediate partially refined products, and natural gas liquids that are processed and blended into refined products) at which we are able to sell refined products. Refining is primarily a margin-based business and, to increase profitability, it is important to maximize the yields of high value finished products while minimizing the costs of feedstock and operating expenses. When the margin between refined product prices and crude oil and other feedstock costs contracts, as we experienced in 2020, our earnings, profitability and cash flows are negatively affected. Historically, refining margins have been volatile, and are likely to continue to be volatile, as a result of a variety of factors, including fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, other feedstocks, refined products and fuel and utility services. An increase or decrease in the price of crude oil will likely result in a similar increase or decrease in prices for refined products; however, there may be a time lag in the realization, or no such realization, of the similar increase or decrease in prices for refined products. The effect of changes in crude oil prices on our refining margins therefore depends in part on how quickly and how fully refined product prices adjust to reflect these changes.\nThe nature of our business has required us to maintain substantial crude oil, feedstock and refined product inventories. Although we reduced our crude oil, feedstock and refined product inventories in 2020 to strengthen our financial position in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, inventory has slowly returned to normalized levels in 2021. Because crude oil, feedstock and refined products are commodities, we have no control over the changing market value of these inventories. Our crude oil, feedstock and refined product inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value under the last-in-first-out (\u201cLIFO\u201d) inventory valuation methodology. If the market value of our crude oil, feedstock and refined product inventory declines to an amount less than our LIFO cost, we would record a write-down of inventory and a non-cash impact to cost of products and other. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an adjustment to value our inventories to the lower of cost or market which decreased income from operations and net income by $268.0 million and $196.7 million, respectively, reflecting the net change in the LCM inventory reserve from $401.6 million at December 31, 2019 to $669.6 million at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021, the replacement value of inventories exceeded the LIFO carrying value, therefore no LCM inventory reserve was recorded.\nPrices of crude oil, other feedstocks, blendstocks, and refined products depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply of and demand for crude oil, other feedstocks, gasoline, diesel, ethanol, asphalt and other refined products. Such supply and demand are affected by a variety of economic, market, environmental and political conditions.\nOur direct operating expense structure also impacts our profitability. Our major direct operating expenses include employee and contract labor, maintenance and energy. Our predominant variable direct operating cost is energy, which is comprised primarily of fuel and other utility services. The volatility in costs of fuel, principally natural gas, and other utility services, principally electricity, used by our refineries and other operations affect our operating costs. Fuel and utility prices have been, and will continue to be, affected by factors outside our control, such as supply and demand for fuel and utility services in both local and regional markets. Natural gas prices have historically been volatile and, typically, electricity prices fluctuate with natural gas prices. Future increases in fuel and utility prices may have a negative effect on our refining margins, profitability and cash flows.\nOur working capital, cash flows and liquidity can be significantly impacted by volatility in commodity prices and refined product demand.\nPayment terms for our crude oil purchases are typically longer than those terms we extend to our customers for sales of refined products. Additionally, reductions in crude oil purchases tend to lag demand decreases for our refined products. As a result of this timing differential, the payables for our crude oil purchases are generally proportionally larger than the receivables for our refined product sales. As we are normally in a net payables position, a decrease in commodity prices generally results in a use of working capital. Given we process a significant volume of crude oil, the impact can materially affect our working capital, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur profitability is affected by crude oil differentials and related factors, which fluctuate substantially.\nA significant portion of our profitability is derived from the ability to purchase and process crude oil feedstocks that historically have been less expensive than benchmark crude oils, such as the heavy, sour crude oils processed at our Delaware City, Paulsboro, Chalmette, Torrance and Martinez refineries. For our Toledo refinery, aside from recent crude differential volatility, purchased crude prices have historically been slightly above the WTI benchmark, however, such crude slate typically results in favorable refinery production yield. For all locations, these crude oil differentials can vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on overall economic conditions and trends and conditions within the markets for crude oil and refined products. Any change in these crude oil differentials may have an impact on our earnings. Our rail investment and strategy to acquire cost advantaged Mid-Continent and Canadian crude, which are priced based on WTI, could be adversely affected when the WTI/Dated Brent or related differentials narrow. A narrowing of the WTI/Dated Brent differential may result in our Toledo refinery losing a portion of its crude oil price advantage over certain of our competitors, which negatively impacts our profitability. In addition, efforts in Canada to control the imbalance between its production and capacity to export crude may continue to result in price volatility and the narrowing of the WTI/WCS differential, which is a proxy for the difference between light U.S. and heavy Canadian crude oil, and may reduce our refining margins and adversely affect our profitability and earnings. Divergent views have been expressed as to the expected magnitude of changes to these crude differentials in future periods. Any continued or further narrowing of these differentials could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.\nAdditionally, governmental and regulatory actions, including continued resolutions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to restrict crude oil production levels and executive actions by the current U.S. presidential administration to restrict the advancement of certain energy infrastructure projects such as the Keystone XL pipeline or Enbridge's Line 5 pipeline, may continue to impact crude oil prices and crude oil differentials. Any increase in crude oil prices or unfavorable movements in crude oil differentials due to such actions or changing regulatory environment may negatively impact our ability to acquire crude oil at economical prices and could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.\nA significant interruption or casualty loss at any of our refineries and related assets or logistics terminals, pipelines or other facilities could reduce our production, particularly if not fully covered by our insurance. Failure by one or more insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could materially and adversely affect our future cash flows, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business currently consists of owning and operating six refineries and related assets, as well as logistics terminals, pipelines and other facilities. As a result, our operations could be subject to significant interruption if any of our refineries or other facilities were to experience a major accident, be damaged by severe weather or other natural disaster, or otherwise be forced to shut down or curtail production due to unforeseen events, such as acts of God, nature, orders of governmental authorities, supply chain disruptions impacting our crude rail facilities or other logistics assets, power outages, acts of terrorism, fires, toxic emissions and maritime hazards. Any such shutdown or disruption would reduce the production from that refinery. There is also risk of mechanical failure and equipment shutdowns both in general and following unforeseen events. Further, in such situations, undamaged refinery processing units may be dependent on or interact with damaged sections of our refineries and, accordingly, are also subject to being shut down. In the event any of our refineries is forced to shut down for a significant period of time, it would have a material adverse effect on our earnings, our other results of operations and our financial condition as a whole.\nAs protection against these hazards, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, such potential losses and liabilities, including claims against us by third parties relating to our operations and products. We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies may increase substantially. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For example, coverage for hurricane damage can be limited, and coverage for terrorism risks can include broad exclusions. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position.\nOur insurance program includes a number of insurance carriers. Significant disruptions in financial markets could lead to a deterioration in the financial condition of many financial institutions, including insurance companies and, therefore, we may not be able to obtain the full amount of our insurance coverage for insured events. Even where we have insurance in place, there can be no assurance that the carriers will honor their obligations under the policies.\nOur refineries are subject to interruptions of supply and distribution as a result of our reliance on pipelines and railroads for transportation of crude oil and refined products.\nOur Toledo, Chalmette, Torrance and Martinez refineries receive a significant portion of their crude oil through our owned, as well as third-party, pipelines. These pipelines include the Enbridge system, Capline and Mid-Valley pipelines for supplying crude to our Toledo refinery, the MOEM Pipeline (which is owned by our subsidiary) and CAM Pipeline for supplying crude to our Chalmette refinery and the San Joaquin Pipeline, San Pablo Bay Pipeline, San Ardo and Coastal Pipeline systems for supplying crude to our Torrance and Martinez refineries. Additionally, our Toledo, Chalmette, Torrance and Martinez refineries deliver a significant portion of the refined products through pipelines. These pipelines include pipelines such as the Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. and Buckeye Partners L.P. pipelines at the Toledo refinery, the Collins pipeline (which is owned by our subsidiary) at our Chalmette refinery, the Jet Pipeline to the Los Angeles International Airport, the Product Pipeline to Vernon and the Product Pipeline to Atwood at our Torrance refinery and the KinderMorgan SFPP North Pipeline at our Martinez refinery. We could experience an interruption of supply or delivery, or an increased cost of receiving crude oil and delivering refined products to market, if the ability of these pipelines to transport crude oil or refined products is disrupted because of accidents, weather interruptions, governmental regulation, terrorism, other third-party action or casualty or other events.\nThe Delaware City rail unloading facilities and the assets acquired in connection with the PBFX acquisition of CPI Operations LLC (the \u201cEast Coast Storage Assets\u201d), allow our East Coast Refining System to source WTI-based crudes from Western Canada and the Mid-Continent, which may provide significant cost advantages versus traditional Brent-based international crudes in certain market environments. Any disruptions or restrictions to our supply of crude by rail due to problems with third-party logistics infrastructure or operations or as a result of increased regulations, could increase our crude costs and negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, due to the common carrier regulatory obligation applicable to interstate oil pipelines, capacity allocation among shippers can become contentious in the event demand is in excess of capacity. Therefore, nominations by new shippers or increased nominations by existing shippers may reduce the capacity available to us. Any prolonged interruption in the operation or curtailment of available capacity of the pipelines that we rely upon for transportation of crude oil and refined products could have a further material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur results of operations continue to be impacted by significant costs to comply with renewable fuels mandates. The market prices for RINs have been volatile and may harm our profitability.\nPursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, EPA has issued the Renewable Fuel Standard, implementing mandates to blend renewable fuels into the petroleum fuels produced and sold in the United States. Under the Renewable Fuel Standard, the volume of renewable fuels that obligated refineries must blend into their finished petroleum fuels historically has increased on an annual basis. In addition, certain states have passed legislation that requires minimum biodiesel blending in finished distillates. On October 13, 2010, EPA raised the maximum amount of ethanol allowed under federal law from 10% to 15% for cars and light trucks manufactured since 2007. The maximum amount allowed under federal law currently remains at 10% ethanol for all other vehicles. Existing laws and regulations could change, and the minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum fuels may increase. Because we do not produce renewable fuels, increasing the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into our products displaces an increasing volume of our refinery\u2019s product pool, potentially resulting in lower earnings and profitability. In addition, in order to meet certain of these and future EPA requirements, we may be required to purchase RINs, which may have fluctuating costs based on market conditions. The price of RINS was significant in 2021 and could increase further in 2022. We incurred approximately $726.0 million in RINs costs during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $326.4 million and $122.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The fluctuations in our RINs costs are due primarily to volatility in prices for ethanol-linked RINs and increases in our production of on-road transportation fuels since 2012. Our RINs purchase obligation is dependent on our actual shipment of on-road transportation fuels domestically and the amount of blending achieved which can cause variability in our profitability. EPA\u2019s proposed volumes of renewable fuels that obligated refineries must blend into their final petroleum fuels are expected to be finalized by the end of the first quarter of 2022. As a result, we could also experience fluctuating compliance costs in the future if the volumes finalized by EPA differ from what has been proposed.\nWe may have capital needs for which our internally generated cash flows and other sources of liquidity may not be adequate.\nIf we cannot generate sufficient cash flows or otherwise secure sufficient liquidity to support our short-term and long-term capital requirements, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations or our future debt obligations, comply with certain deadlines related to environmental regulations and standards, or pursue our business strategies, including acquisitions, in which case our operations may not perform as we currently expect. We have substantial short-term capital needs and may have substantial long-term capital needs. Our short-term working capital needs are primarily related to financing certain of our crude oil and refined products inventory not covered by our various supply agreements and the Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement.\nIf we cannot adequately handle our crude oil and feedstock requirements or if we are required to obtain our crude oil supply at our other refineries without the benefit of the existing supply arrangements or the applicable counterparty defaults in its obligations, our crude oil pricing costs may increase as the number of days between when we pay for the crude oil and when the crude oil is delivered to us increases. Termination of our Third Inventory Intermediation Agreement with J. Aron, which is currently scheduled to expire in 2024, would require us to finance the J. Aron Products covered by the agreement, which financing may not be available at terms that are as favorable or at all. We are obligated to repurchase from J. Aron all volumes of the J. Aron Products upon expiration or earlier termination of this agreement, which may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, working capital and financial condition. Further, if we are not able to market and sell our finished products to credit worthy customers, we may be subject to delays in the collection of our accounts receivable and exposure to additional credit risk. Such increased exposure could negatively impact our liquidity due to our increased working capital needs as a result of the increase in the amount of crude oil inventory and accounts receivable we would have to carry on our balance sheet. Our long-term needs for cash include those to repay our indebtedness and other contractual obligations, support ongoing capital expenditures for equipment maintenance and upgrades, including during turnarounds at our refineries, and to complete our routine and normally scheduled maintenance, regulatory and security expenditures.\nIn addition, from time to time, we are required to spend significant amounts for repairs when one or more processing units experiences temporary shutdowns. We continue to utilize significant capital to upgrade equipment, improve facilities, and reduce operational, safety and environmental risks. In connection with the Paulsboro, Torrance and Martinez acquisitions, we assumed certain significant environmental obligations, and we have assumed a portion of certain environmental liabilities that may arise in connection with the Martinez acquisition and may similarly do so in future acquisitions. We will likely incur substantial compliance costs in connection with new or changing environmental, health and safety regulations. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Our liquidity and financial condition will affect our ability to satisfy any and all of these needs or obligations.\nWe may incur significant liability under, or costs and capital expenditures to comply with, environmental and health and safety regulations, which are complex and change frequently.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state and local laws regulating, among other things, the use and/or handling of petroleum and other regulated materials, the emission and discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and remediation of discharges of petroleum and petroleum products, characteristics and composition of gasoline and distillates and other matters otherwise relating to the protection of the environment and the health and safety of the surrounding community. Our operations are also subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety.\nWe cannot predict what additional environmental, health and safety legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future, or how existing or future laws or regulations may be administered or interpreted with respect to our operations. Many of these laws and regulations have become increasingly stringent over time, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. For example, on July 21, 2021, the board of Bay Area Air Quality Management District (\u201cBAAQMD\u201d) voted to adopt proposed amendments to \u201cRegulation 6-5: Particulate Emissions from Refinery Fluidized Catalytic Cracking Units - 2021 Amendment\u201d (\u201cRule 6-5 Amendment\u201d) requiring compliance with more stringent standards for particulate emissions from FCC units at refineries in the Bay Area by 2026. The regulation does not require that any specific technology be utilized to meet the new standards. The costs incurred by us to achieve the new emissions standards at our Martinez refinery within the required timeframe may be significant, and there can be no assurance that the measures we implement will achieve the required emissions reductions.\nCertain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances, joint and several, liability for costs of investigation and cleanup of spills, discharges or releases on owners and operators of, as well as persons who arrange for treatment or disposal of regulated materials at, contaminated sites. Under these laws, we may incur liability or be required to pay penalties for past contamination, and third parties may assert claims against us for damages allegedly arising out of any past or future contamination. The potential penalties and clean-up costs for past or future spills, discharges or releases, the failure of prior owners of our facilities to complete their clean-up obligations, the liability to third parties for damage to their property, or the need to address newly-discovered information or conditions that may require a response could be significant, and the payment of these amounts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nPotential further laws and regulations related to climate change could have a material adverse impact on our operations and adversely affect our facilities.\nSome scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. We believe the issue of climate change will likely continue to receive scientific and political attention, with the potential for further laws and regulations that could materially adversely affect our ongoing operations.\nIn addition, as many of our facilities are located near coastal areas, rising sea levels may disrupt our ability to operate those facilities or transport crude oil and refined products. Extended periods of such disruption could have an adverse effect on our results of operation. We could also incur substantial costs to protect or repair these facilities.\nRegulation of emissions of greenhouse gases could force us to incur increased capital expenditures and operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nBoth houses of Congress have actively considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, such as carbon dioxide and methane, including proposals to: (i) establish a cap and trade system, (ii) create a federal renewable energy or \u201cclean\u201d energy standard requiring electric utilities to provide a certain percentage of power from such sources, and (iii) create enhanced incentives for use of renewable energy and increased efficiency in energy supply and use. In addition, EPA is taking steps to regulate GHGs under the existing federal Clean Air Act. EPA has already adopted regulations limiting emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles, addressing the permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources, and requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources, including refineries. These and similar regulations could require us to incur costs to monitor and report GHG emissions or reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations. In addition, various states, individually as well as in some cases on a regional basis, have taken steps to control GHG emissions, including adoption of GHG reporting requirements, cap and trade systems and renewable portfolio standards (such as AB 32). On September 23, 2020 the Governor of California issued an executive order effectively banning the sale of new gasoline-powered passenger cars and trucks by 2035 and requiring zero-emission medium to heavy duty vehicles by 2045 everywhere feasible. The executive order requires state agencies to build out sufficient electric vehicle charging infrastructure. It is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate form, timing or extent of federal or state regulation. In the event we do incur increased costs as a result of increased efforts to control GHG emissions, we may not be able to pass on any of these costs to our customers. Regulatory requirements also could adversely affect demand for the refined products that we produce. Any increased costs or reduced demand could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nRequirements to reduce emissions could result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities as well as implement and manage new emission controls and programs put in place. For example, in September 2016, the state of California enacted Senate Bill 32 which further reduces greenhouse gas emissions targets to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. Two regulations implemented to achieve these goals are Cap-and-Trade and the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (\u201cLCFS\u201d). In 2012, CARB implemented Cap-and-Trade. This program currently places a cap on GHGs and we are required to acquire a sufficient number of credits to cover emissions from our refineries and our in-state sales of gasoline and diesel. In 2009, CARB adopted the LCFS, which required a 10% reduction in the carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel by 2020. In 2018, CARB amended the LCFS to require a 20% reduction by 2030. Compliance is achieved through blending lower carbon intensity biofuels into gasoline and diesel or by purchasing credits. Compliance with each of these programs is facilitated through a market-based credit system. If sufficient credits are unavailable for purchase or we are unable to pass through costs to our customers, we have to pay a higher price for credits or if we are otherwise unable to meet our compliance obligations, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOn September 23, 2020, the California Governor issued Executive Order N-79-20 (\u201cN-79-20 Order\u201d) intended to further reduce GHGs within the state. The N-79-20 Order sets a 2035 goal of no sale of internal combustion engines for passenger cars and pickup trucks within California, and a 2045 goal of no sale of internal combustion engine medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and off-road vehicles and equipment. However, the N-79-20 Order would still allow used internal combustion engine vehicles to be used and sold after these dates. The N-79-20 Order encourages zero emissions technologies such as electric vehicles, and accelerated deployment of affordable fueling and charging options. It is currently uncertain how the N-79-20 Order may be ultimately implemented by various California regulatory agencies. In the event we do incur increased costs as a result of increased efforts to control GHG emissions through future adopted regulatory requirements, we may not be able to pass these costs to our customers. These future regulatory requirements also could adversely\naffect demand for the refined products that we produce. Any increased costs or reduced demand could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nEnvironmental clean-up and remediation costs of our sites and environmental litigation could decrease our net cash flow, reduce our results of operations and impair our financial condition.\nWe may be subject to liability for the investigation and clean-up of environmental contamination at each of the properties that we own, lease, occupy or operate and at off-site locations where we arrange for the treatment or disposal of regulated materials. We may become involved in litigation or other proceedings related to the foregoing. If we were to be held responsible for damages in any such litigation or proceedings, such costs may not be covered by insurance and may be material. Historical soil and groundwater contamination has been identified at our refineries. Currently, remediation projects for such contamination are underway in accordance with regulatory requirements at our refineries. In connection with the acquisitions of certain of our refineries and logistics assets, the prior owners have retained certain liabilities or indemnified us for certain liabilities, including those relating to pre-acquisition soil and groundwater conditions, and in some instances we have assumed certain liabilities and environmental obligations, including certain existing and potential remediation obligations. If the prior owners fail to satisfy their obligations for any reason, or if significant liabilities arise in the areas in which we assumed liability, we may become responsible for remediation expenses and other environmental liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. As a result, in addition to making capital expenditures or incurring other costs to comply with environmental laws, we also may be liable for significant environmental litigation or for investigation and remediation costs and other liabilities arising from the ownership or operation of these assets by prior owners, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Environmental, Health and Safety Matters\u201d and \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Contractual Obligations and Commitments\u201d.\nWe may also face liability arising from current or future claims alleging personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other regulated materials, such as various perfluorinated compounds, including perfluorooctanoate, perfluorooctane sulfonate, perfluorohexane sulfonate, or other per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (collectively, \u201cPFAS\u201d), asbestos, benzene, silica dust and petroleum hydrocarbons, at or from our facilities. We may also face liability for personal injury, property damage, natural resource damage or clean-up costs for the alleged migration of contamination from our properties. A significant increase in the number or success of these claims could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Recently, we have been voluntarily cooperating with various local, state and federal agencies in their review of the environmental and health effects of PFAS and additional PFAS-related laws may be developed at the local, state and federal level that could lead to our incurring liability for damages or other costs, civil or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, or other remedies or otherwise affect our business. Governmental inquiries or lawsuits involving PFAS could lead to our incurring liability for damages or other costs, civil or criminal proceedings, the imposition of fines and penalties, or other remedies, as well as restrictions on or added costs for our business operations going forward, including in the form of restrictions on discharges at our manufacturing facilities or otherwise. We may be subject to asserted or unasserted claims and governmental regulatory proceedings and inquiries related to the use of PFAS in a variety of jurisdictions.\nOur pipelines are subject to federal and/or state regulations, which could reduce profitability and the amount of cash we generate.\nOur transportation activities are subject to regulation by multiple governmental agencies. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the United States Department of Transportation, and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective or what impact such proposals may have. Projected operating costs related to our pipelines reflect the recurring costs resulting from compliance with these regulations, and these costs may increase due to future acquisitions, changes in regulation, changes in use, or discovery of existing but unknown compliance issues.\nWe could incur substantial costs or disruptions in our business if we cannot obtain or maintain necessary permits and authorizations or otherwise comply with health, safety, environmental and other laws and regulations.\nOur operations require numerous permits and authorizations under various laws and regulations. These authorizations and permits are subject to revocation, renewal or modification and can require operational changes to limit impacts or potential impacts on the environment and/or health and safety. A violation of authorization or permit conditions or other legal or regulatory requirements could result in substantial fines, criminal sanctions, permit revocations, injunctions, and/or facility shutdowns. In addition, major modifications of our operations could require modifications to our existing permits or upgrades to our existing pollution control equipment. Any or all of these matters could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may incur significant liabilities under, or costs and capital expenditures to comply with, health, safety, environmental and other laws and regulations, which are complex and change frequently. Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws regulating, among other things, the handling of petroleum and other regulated materials, the emission and discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, and remediation of discharges of petroleum and petroleum products, characteristics and composition of gasoline and distillates and other matters otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Our operations are also subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety, in addition to laws and regulations affecting the transportation of crude oil by rail in North America.\nWe cannot predict what additional environmental, health and safety legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future, or how existing or future laws or regulations may be administered or interpreted with respect to our operations. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time.\nCertain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances joint and several liability for, costs of investigation and cleanup of such spills, discharges or releases on owners and operators of, as well as persons who arrange for treatment or disposal of regulated materials at contaminated sites. Under these laws, we may incur liability or be required to pay penalties for past contamination, and third parties may assert claims against us for damages allegedly arising out of any past or future contamination. The potential penalties and clean-up costs for past or future releases or spills, the failure of prior owners of our facilities to complete their clean-up obligations, the liability to third parties for damage to their property, or the need to address newly-discovered information or conditions that may require a response could be significant, and the payment of these amounts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnhanced scrutiny on ESG matters may negatively impact our business and our access to capital markets.\nEnhanced scrutiny on ESG matters may impact our business as it relates to the use of refined products, climate change, increasing public expectations on companies to address climate change, and potential use of substitutes or replacements to our products may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our products, reduced profits, increased regulations and litigation, and adverse impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets. In addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform and advise their investment and voting decisions. Also, some stakeholders may advocate for divestment of fossil fuel investments and encourage lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the manufacturing of refined products. Unfavorable ESG ratings and investment community divestment initiatives may lead to negative investor and public sentiment toward the Company and to the diversion of capital from our industry, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to, and costs of, capital.\nWe may not be able to obtain funding on acceptable terms or at all because of volatility and uncertainty in the credit and capital markets. This may hinder or prevent us from meeting our future capital needs.\nIn the past, global financial markets and economic conditions have been, and may again be, subject to disruption and volatile due to a variety of factors, including uncertainty in the financial services sector, low consumer confidence, falling commodity prices, geopolitical issues and generally weak economic conditions. In addition, the fixed income markets have experienced periods of extreme volatility that have negatively impacted market liquidity conditions, including as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets has increased substantially at times while the availability of funds from those markets diminished significantly. In particular, as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally, which may be subject to unforeseen disruptions, the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets may increase as many lenders and institutional investors increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt on similar terms or at all and reduce or, in some cases, cease to provide funding to borrowers. Due to these factors, we cannot be certain that new debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms. If funding is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due. Moreover, without adequate funding, we may be unable to execute our growth strategy, complete future acquisitions, take advantage of other business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nAny political instability, military strikes, sustained military campaigns, terrorist activity, changes in foreign policy, or other catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAny political instability, military strikes, sustained military campaigns, terrorist activity, changes in foreign policy in areas or regions of the world where we acquire crude oil and other raw materials or sell our refined products may affect our business in unpredictable ways, including forcing us to increase security measures and causing disruptions of supplies and distribution markets. We may also be subject to United States trade and economic sanctions laws, which change frequently as a result of foreign policy developments, and which may necessitate changes to our crude oil acquisition activities. Further, like other industrial companies, our facilities may be the target of terrorist activities or subject to catastrophic events such as natural disasters and pandemic illness. Any act of war, terrorism, or other catastrophic events that resulted in damage to, or otherwise disrupts the operating activities of, any of our refineries or third-party facilities upon which we are dependent for our business operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA cyber-attack on, or other failure of, our technology infrastructure could affect our business and assets, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are becoming increasingly dependent on our technology infrastructure and certain critical information systems which process, transmit and store electronic information, including information we use to safely and effectively operate our respective assets and businesses. These information systems include data network and telecommunications, internet access, our websites, and various computer hardware equipment and software applications, including those that are critical to the safe operation of our refineries and logistics assets. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant time, manpower and capital in our technology infrastructure and information systems. These information systems are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters, software viruses or other malware, power failures, cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, cyber-attacks, which may render data systems unusable, and physical threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure. Additionally, our business is highly dependent on financial, accounting and other data processing systems and other communications and information systems, including our enterprise resource planning tools. We process a large number of transactions on a daily basis and rely upon the proper functioning of computer systems. Furthermore, we rely on information systems across our respective operations, including the management of supply chain and various other processes and transactions. As a result, a disruption on any information systems at our refineries or logistics assets, may cause disruptions to our collective operations.\nThe potential for such security threats or system failures has subjected our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that these information systems are under our control, we have implemented measures such as virus protection software, emergency recovery processes and a formal disaster recovery plan to address the outlined risks. However, security measures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe, and our formal disaster recovery plan and other implemented measures may not prevent delays or other complications that could arise from an information systems failure. If a key system were hacked or otherwise interfered with by an unauthorized user, or were to fail or experience unscheduled downtime for any reason, even if only for a short period, or any compromise of our data security or our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time, it could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business, damage our reputation and subject us to additional costs and liabilities. The increase in companies and individuals working remotely has increased the frequency and scope of cyber-attacks and the risk of potential cybersecurity incidents, both deliberate attacks and unintentional events. While, to date, we have not had a significant cybersecurity breach or attack that had a material impact on our business or results of operations, if we were to be subject to a material successful cyber intrusion, it could result in remediation or service restoration costs, increased cyber protection costs, lost revenues, litigation or regulatory actions by governmental authorities, increased insurance premiums, reputational damage and damage to our competitiveness, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCyber-attacks against us or others in our industry could result in additional regulations, and U.S. government warnings have indicated that infrastructure assets, including pipelines, may be specifically targeted by certain groups. These attacks include, without limitation, malicious software, ransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches. These attacks may be perpetrated by state-sponsored groups, \u201chacktivists\u201d, criminal organizations or private individuals (including employee malfeasance). Current efforts by the federal government, including the Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure executive order, the issuance of new cybersecurity requirements for critical pipeline owners and operators issued by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Transportation Security Administration following a cyber-attack on a major petroleum pipeline in 2021, and any potential future regulations could lead to increased regulatory compliance costs, insurance coverage cost or capital expenditures. We cannot predict the potential impact to our business or the energy industry resulting from additional regulations.\nFurther, our business interruption insurance may not compensate us adequately for losses that may occur. We do not carry insurance specifically for cybersecurity events; however, certain of our insurance policies may allow for coverage for a cyber-event resulting in ensuing property damage from an otherwise insured peril. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner and may be insufficient if such an event were to occur.\nCompetition from companies who have not been adversely impacted as much as we have been by the COVID-19 pandemic, produce their own supply of feedstocks, have extensive retail outlets, make alternative fuels or have greater financial and other resources than we do could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur refining operations compete with domestic refiners and marketers in regions of the United States in which we operate, as well as with domestic refiners in other regions and foreign refiners that import products into the United States. In addition, we compete with other refiners, producers and marketers in other industries that supply their own renewable fuels or alternative forms of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements of our industrial, commercial and individual consumers. Many of our competitors have not been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as much as we have been impacted. Certain of our competitors have larger and more complex refineries, and may be able to realize lower per-barrel costs or higher margins per barrel of throughput. Several of our principal competitors are integrated national or international oil companies that are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do and access to proprietary sources of controlled crude oil production. Unlike these competitors, we obtain substantially all of our feedstocks from unaffiliated sources. We are not engaged in the petroleum exploration and production business and therefore do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks. We do not have a retail business and therefore are dependent upon others for outlets for our refined products. Because of their integrated operations and larger capitalization, these companies may be more flexible in responding to volatile industry or market conditions, such as shortages of crude oil supply and other feedstocks or intense price fluctuations and they may also be able to obtain more favorable trade credit terms.\nNewer or upgraded refineries will often be more efficient than our refineries, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. We have taken significant measures to maintain our refineries including the installation of new equipment and redesigning older equipment to improve our operations. However, these actions involve significant uncertainties, since upgraded equipment may not perform at expected throughput levels, the yield and product quality of new equipment may differ from design specifications and modifications may be needed to correct equipment that does not perform as expected. Any of these risks associated with new equipment, redesigned older equipment or repaired equipment could lead to lower revenues or higher costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition. Over time, our refineries or certain refinery units may become obsolete, or be unable to compete, because of the construction of new, more efficient facilities by our competitors.\nWe must make substantial capital expenditures on our operating facilities to maintain their reliability and efficiency. If we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs and/or in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nDelays or cost increases related to capital spending programs involving engineering, procurement and construction of new facilities (or improvements and repairs to our existing facilities and equipment, including turnarounds) could adversely affect our ability to achieve targeted internal rates of return and operating results. Such delays or cost increases may arise as a result of unpredictable factors in the marketplace, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022denial or delay in obtaining regulatory approvals and/or permits;\n\u2022unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor;\n\u2022disruptions in transportation of modular components and/or construction materials;\n\u2022severe adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors and suppliers;\n\u2022shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages;\n\u2022market-related increases in a project\u2019s debt or equity financing costs; and/or\n\u2022non-performance or force majeure by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors or sub-contractors involved with a project.\nOur refineries contain many processing units, a number of which have been in operation for many years. Equipment, even if properly maintained, may require significant capital expenditures and expenses to keep it operating at optimum efficiency. One or more of the units may require unscheduled downtime for unanticipated maintenance or repairs that are more frequent than our scheduled turnarounds for such units. Scheduled and unscheduled maintenance could reduce our revenues during the period of time that the units are not operating.\nOur forecasted internal rates of return are also based upon our projections of future market fundamentals, which are not within our control, including changes in general economic conditions, impact of new regulations, available alternative supply and customer demand. Any one or more of these factors could have a significant impact on our business. If we were unable to make up the delays associated with such factors or to recover the related costs, or if market conditions change, it could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are subject to strict laws and regulations regarding employee and process safety, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and profitability.\nWe are subject to the requirements of the OSHA, and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, OSHA requires that we maintain information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that we provide this information to employees, state and local governmental authorities, and local residents. Failure to comply with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, process safety standards and control of occupational exposure to regulated substances, could result in claims against us that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and the cash flows of the business if we are subjected to significant fines or compliance costs.\nPBF Energy has suspended its quarterly dividend and does not anticipate that it will declare dividends in the foreseeable future.\nOn March 30, 2020, PBF Energy announced that it has suspended its quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share on its Class A common stock, as part of its strategic plan to respond to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and related market activity. PBF Energy is not obligated under any applicable laws, its governing documents or any contractual agreements with its existing and prior owners or otherwise to declare or pay any dividends or other distributions (other than the obligations of PBF LLC to make tax distributions to its members). Any future declaration, amount and payment of any dividends will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors, however, because the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and related market activity is difficult to predict, we do not anticipate that our Board of Directors will determine to declare a dividend in the foreseeable future. Our Board of Directors may take into account, among other things, general economic conditions, our financial condition and operating results, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, plans for expansion, including acquisitions, tax, legal, regulatory and contractual restrictions and implications, including under our subsidiaries\u2019 outstanding debt documents, and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant in determining whether to declare or pay any dividend. Because PBF Energy is a holding company with no material assets (other than the equity interests of its direct subsidiary), its cash flow and ability to pay dividends is dependent upon the financial results and cash flows of its indirect subsidiaries PBF Holding and PBFX and their respective operating subsidiaries and the distribution or other payment of cash to it in the form of dividends or otherwise. The direct and indirect subsidiaries of PBF\nEnergy are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to make any funds available to it other than in the case of certain intercompany transactions. As a result, if PBF Energy does not declare or pay dividends you may not receive any return on an investment in PBF Energy Class A common stock unless you sell PBF Energy Class A common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nProduct liability and operational liability claims and litigation could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nProduct liability and liability arising from our operations are significant risks. Substantial damage awards have been made in certain jurisdictions against manufacturers and resellers of petroleum products based upon claims for injuries and property damage caused by the use of or exposure to various products. Failure of our products to meet required specifications or claims that a product is inherently defective could result in product liability claims from our shippers and customers, and also arise from contaminated or off-specification product in commingled pipelines and storage tanks and/or defective fuels. We may also be subject to personal injury claims arising from incidents that occur in connection with or relating to our operations. Product liability and personal injury claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCompliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance.\nWe are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal, state, local and foreign taxes such as income, excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, property, gross receipts, withholding and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. These liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authorities, which could increase our tax liabilities. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may also subject us to interest and penalties. There can be no certainty that our federal, state, local or foreign taxes could be passed on to our customers.\nAcquisitions that we may undertake in the future involve a number of risks, any of which could cause us not to realize the anticipated benefits.\nWe may not be successful in acquiring additional assets, and any acquisitions that we do consummate may not produce the anticipated benefits or may have adverse effects on our business and operating results. We may selectively consider strategic acquisitions in the future within the refining and mid-stream sector based on performance through the cycle, advantageous access to crude oil supplies, attractive refined products market fundamentals and access to distribution and logistics infrastructure. Our ability to do so will be dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates, consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms, successfully integrate acquired assets and obtain financing to fund acquisitions and to support our growth and many other factors beyond our control. Risks associated with acquisitions include those relating to the diversion of management time and attention from our existing business, liability for known or unknown environmental conditions or other contingent liabilities and greater than anticipated expenditures required for compliance with environmental, safety or other regulatory standards or for investments to improve operating results, and the incurrence of additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions or capital expenditures relating to acquired assets. We may also enter into transition services agreements in the future with sellers of any additional refineries we acquire. Such services may not be performed timely and effectively, and any significant disruption in such transition services or unanticipated costs related to such services could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, it is likely that, when we acquire refineries, we will not have access to the type of historical financial information that we will require regarding the prior operation of the refineries. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to evaluate the probable impact of significant acquisitions on our financial performance until we have operated the acquired refineries for a substantial period of time.\nA portion of our workforce is unionized, and we may face labor disruptions that would interfere with our operations.\nMost hourly employees at our refineries are covered by collective bargaining agreements through the USW, the IOW and the IBEW. Certain of these agreements have expired while others are scheduled to expire on various dates in 2022 through 2024 (See \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d - Employees). For the agreements that expired, terms related to new collective bargaining agreements have been agreed to on local bargaining issues and are pending settlement of the National Oil Bargaining Program which will set contract term, wages, health care contributions and any other agreed upon issues prior to being executed. During this interim period, the terms of the expired agreements will remain in place under rolling 24-hour extensions until new agreements are finalized. Future negotiations prior to the expiration of our collective agreements may result in labor unrest for which a strike or work stoppage is possible. Strikes and/or work stoppages could negatively affect our operational and financial results and may increase operating expenses at the refineries.\nOur business may suffer if any of our senior executives or other key employees discontinues employment with us. Furthermore, a shortage of skilled labor or disruptions in our labor force may make it difficult for us to maintain labor productivity.\nOur future success depends to a large extent on the services of our senior executives and other key employees. Our business depends on our continuing ability to recruit, train and retain highly qualified employees in all areas of our operations, including engineering, accounting, business operations, finance and other key back-office and mid-office personnel. Furthermore, our operations require skilled and experienced employees with proficiency in multiple tasks. The competition for these employees is intense, and the loss of these executives or employees could harm our business. If any of these executives or other key personnel resigns or becomes unable to continue in his or her present role and is not adequately replaced, our business operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur hedging activities may limit our potential gains, exacerbate potential losses and involve other risks.\nWe may enter into commodity derivatives contracts to hedge our crude price risk or crack spread risk with respect to a portion of our expected gasoline and distillate production on a rolling basis or to hedge our exposure to the price of natural gas, which is a significant component of our refinery operating expenses. Consistent with that policy we may hedge some percentage of our future crude and natural gas supply. We may enter into hedging arrangements with the intent to secure a minimum fixed cash flow stream on the volume of products hedged during the hedge term and to protect against volatility in commodity prices. Our hedging arrangements may fail to fully achieve these objectives for a variety of reasons, including our failure to have adequate hedging arrangements, if any, in effect at any particular time and the failure of our hedging arrangements to produce the anticipated results. We may not be able to procure adequate hedging arrangements due to a variety of factors. Moreover, such transactions may limit our ability to benefit from favorable changes in crude oil, refined product and natural gas prices.\nIn addition, our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:\n\u2022the volumes of our actual use of crude oil or natural gas or production of the applicable refined products is less than the volumes subject to the hedging arrangement;\n\u2022accidents, interruptions in feedstock transportation, inclement weather or other events cause unscheduled shutdowns or otherwise adversely affect our refineries, or those of our suppliers or customers;\n\u2022changes in commodity prices have a material impact on collateral and margin requirements under our hedging arrangements, resulting in us being subject to margin calls;\n\u2022the counterparties to our derivative contracts fail to perform under the contracts; or\n\u2022a sudden, unexpected event materially impacts the commodity or crack spread subject to the hedging arrangement.\nAs a result, the effectiveness of our hedging strategy could have a material impact on our financial results. See \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nIn addition, these hedging activities involve basis risk. Basis risk in a hedging arrangement occurs when the price of the commodity we hedge is more or less variable than the index upon which the hedged commodity is based, thereby making the hedge less effective. For example, a New York Mercantile Exchange index used for hedging certain volumes of our crude oil or refined products may have more or less variability than the actual cost or price we realize for such crude oil or refined products. We may not hedge all the basis risk inherent in our hedging arrangements and derivative contracts.\nOur commodity derivative activities could result in period-to-period earnings volatility.\nWe do not currently apply hedge accounting to any of our commodity derivative contracts and, as a result, unrealized gains and losses will be charged to our earnings based on the increase or decrease in the market value of such unsettled positions. These gains and losses may be reflected in our income statement in periods that differ from when the settlement of the underlying hedged items are reflected in our income statement. Such derivative gains or losses in earnings may produce significant period-to-period earnings volatility that is not necessarily reflective of our underlying operational performance.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness.\nOur indebtedness may significantly affect our financial flexibility in the future. As of December 31, 2021, we have total debt of $4,330.8 million, excluding unamortized deferred debt issuance costs of $35.0 million and our PBF LLC Affiliate note payable with PBF Energy that eliminates in consolidation at the PBF Energy level, and we could incur additional borrowings under our credit facilities. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future including additional secured indebtedness, subject to the satisfaction of any debt incurrence and, if applicable, lien incurrence limitation covenants in our existing financing agreements. Although we were in compliance with incurrence covenants during the year ended December 31, 2021, to the extent that any of our activities triggered these covenants, there are no assurances that conditions could not change significantly, and that such changes could adversely impact our ability to meet some of these incurrence covenants at the time that we needed to. Failure to meet the incurrence covenants could impose certain incremental restrictions on, among other matters, our ability to incur new debt (including secured debt) and also may limit the extent to which we may pay future dividends, make new investments, repurchase our stock or incur new liens.\nThe level of our indebtedness has several important consequences for our future operations, including that:\n\u2022a portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes;\n\u2022under certain circumstances, covenants contained in our existing debt arrangements limit our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets and make certain investments;\n\u2022in certain circumstances these covenants also require us to meet or maintain certain financial tests, which may affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in our industry, such as being able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities when they arise;\n\u2022our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate and other purposes may be limited; and\n\u2022we may be at a competitive disadvantage to those of our competitors that are less leveraged; and we may be more vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions.\nOur indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations, certain of which contain cross-default and/or cross-acceleration provisions. Our, and our subsidiaries\u2019, ability to meet future principal obligations will be dependent upon our future performance, which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay our indebtedness. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, we may be required to sell assets, to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or to obtain additional financing. Refinancing may not be possible and additional financing may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe may not be able to secure necessary financing on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe currently have notes outstanding with varying maturity dates beginning in 2023 and ending in 2028. Additionally, our most significant credit facilities - the Revolving Credit Facility and the PBFX amended and restated revolving credit facility (the \u201cPBFX Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) - both have maturity dates in 2023. We can make no assurance that we will be able to refinance our outstanding indebtedness on acceptable terms prior to their maturity dates. Market disruptions, such as those experienced in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, may increase our cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to refinance our obligations as they become due. Further, ESG concerns and other pressures on the oil and gas industry could lead to increased costs of financing or limit our access to the capital markets. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness or access additional credit, or if short-term or long-term borrowing costs significantly increase, our ability to finance current operations and meet our short-term and long-term obligations could be adversely affected.\nDespite our substantial level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt, which could exacerbate the risks described above.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future including additional secured or unsecured debt. Although our debt instruments and financing arrangements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. To the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels, the leverage risks described above would increase. Also, these restrictions do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness.\nOur future credit ratings could adversely affect our business, the cost of our borrowing, and our ability to obtain credit in the future.\nChanges in our credit profile could affect the way crude oil and other suppliers view our ability to make payments and induce them to shorten the payment terms for our purchases or require us to post security or letters of credit prior to payment. Due to the large dollar amounts and volume of our crude oil and other feedstock purchases, any imposition by these suppliers of more burdensome payment terms on us may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to make payments to our suppliers. This, in turn, could cause us to be unable to operate one or more of our refineries at full capacity.\nThe 6.0% senior unsecured notes due 2028 (the \u201c2028 Senior Notes\u201d) and the 7.25% senior unsecured notes due 2025 (the \u201c2025 Senior Notes\u201d) are rated Caa1 by Moody\u2019s, B by S&P, and B- by Fitch. The 9.25% senior secured notes due 2025 (the \u201c2025 Senior Secured Notes\u201d) are rated B2 by Moody\u2019s, BB- by S&P, and BB by Fitch. The 6.875% PBFX senior notes due 2023 (the \u201cPBFX 2023 Senior Notes\u201d) are rated B3 by Moody\u2019s, B by S&P, and B+ by Fitch. During 2021, Moody\u2019s and S&P downgraded our corporate family rating as well as our unsecured and secured notes ratings, with all ratings on negative outlook. If the current market conditions persist or deteriorate, we expect that the credit rating agencies will continue to re-evaluate our corporate credit rating and the ratings of our unsecured and secured notes. Adverse changes in our credit ratings may also negatively impact the terms of credit we receive from our suppliers and require us to prepay or post collateral. Further adverse actions taken by the rating agencies on our corporate credit rating or the rating of our notes may further increase our cost of borrowings or hinder our ability to raise financing in the capital markets\nor have an unfavorable impact on the credit terms we have with our suppliers, which could impair our ability to grow our business, increase our liquidity and make cash distributions to our shareholders.\nRestrictive covenants in our debt instruments, including the indentures governing our notes, may limit our ability to undertake certain types of transactions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to service our indebtedness.\nVarious covenants in our current and future debt instruments and other financing arrangements, including the indentures governing our notes, may restrict our and our subsidiaries\u2019 financial flexibility in a number of ways. Our current indebtedness and the indentures that govern our notes subject us to significant financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, place liens upon assets, pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments and investments, consummate certain asset sales or asset swaps, conduct businesses other than our current businesses, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. Some of our debt instruments also require our subsidiaries to satisfy or maintain certain financial condition tests in certain circumstances. Our ability to meet these financial condition tests can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not meet such tests. In addition, a failure to comply with the provisions of our existing debt could result in an event of default that could enable our lenders, subject to the terms and conditions of such debt, to declare the outstanding principal, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. Events beyond our control, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental responses and developments in the global oil markets, may affect our ability to comply with our covenants. If we were unable to repay the accelerated amounts, our lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such debt. If the payment of our debt is accelerated, defaults under our other debt instruments, if any, may be triggered, and our assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full.\nProvisions in our indentures and other agreements could discourage an acquisition of us by a third-party.\nCertain provisions of our indentures could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third-party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a \u201cchange of control\u201d as described in the indentures governing the 2025 Senior Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes, the 2028 Senior Notes and the PBFX 2023 Senior Notes, holders of our notes could require us to repurchase all outstanding notes at 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, at the date of repurchase. Certain other significant agreements of ours such as our agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Agreement\u201d), Tax Receivable Agreement (as defined below) and the Third Intermediation Agreement with J. Aron also contain provisions related to a change in control that could make it more difficult or expensive for a third-party to acquire us.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure and PBF Energy Class A Common Stock\nPBF Energy is the managing member of PBF LLC and its only material asset is its interest in PBF LLC. Accordingly, PBF Energy depends upon distributions from PBF LLC and its subsidiaries to pay its taxes, meet its other obligations and/or pay dividends in the future.\nPBF Energy is a holding company and all of its operations are conducted through subsidiaries of PBF LLC. PBF Energy has no independent means of generating revenue and no material assets other than its ownership interest in PBF LLC. We depend on the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries to meet our obligations, including our indebtedness, tax liabilities and obligations to make payments under a tax receivable agreement entered into with PBF LLC Series A and PBF LLC Series B unitholders (the \u201cTax Receivable Agreement\u201d). If we do not receive such cash distributions, dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to meet our obligations and/or pay dividends.\nPBF Energy, as the sole managing partner of PBF LLC, may cause PBF LLC to make distributions to its members in an amount sufficient to enable PBF Energy to cover all applicable taxes at assumed tax rates, to make payments owed by PBF Energy under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and to pay other obligations and dividends, if any, declared by PBF Energy. To the extent we need funds and any of our subsidiaries is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of our financing or other contractual arrangements, or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, such restrictions could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility, the 2028 Senior Notes, the 2025 Senior Notes, the 2025 Senior Secured Notes and certain of our other outstanding debt arrangements include a restricted payment covenant, which restricts the ability of PBF Holding to make distributions to us, and we anticipate our future debt will contain a similar restriction. PBFX Revolving Credit Facility and PBFX\u2019s indenture governing its PBFX 2023 Senior Notes also contain covenants that limit or restrict PBFX\u2019s ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to make distributions and other restricted payments and restrict PBFX\u2019s ability to incur liens and enter into burdensome agreements. In addition, there may be restrictions on payments by our subsidiaries under applicable laws, including laws that require companies to maintain minimum amounts of capital and to make payments to stockholders only from profits. For example, PBF Holding is generally prohibited under Delaware law from making a distribution to a member to the extent that, at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, liabilities of the limited liability company (with certain exceptions) exceed the fair value of its assets, and PBFX is subject to a similar prohibition. As a result, we may be unable to obtain that cash to satisfy our obligations and make payments to PBF Energy stockholders, if any.\nThe rights of other members of PBF LLC may conflict with the interests of PBF Energy Class A common stockholders.\nThe interests of the other members of PBF LLC, which include current and former directors and officers, may not in all cases be aligned with PBF Energy Class A common stockholders\u2019 interests. For example, these members may have different tax positions which could influence their positions, including regarding whether and when we dispose of assets and whether and when we incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, especially in light of the existence of the Tax Receivable Agreement. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration these tax or other considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to PBF Energy Class A common stockholders or us. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions-IPO Related Agreements\u201d in our 2022 Proxy Statement incorporated herein by reference.\nUnder the Tax Receivable Agreement, PBF Energy is required to pay the former and current holders of PBF LLC Series A Units and PBF LLC Series B Units for certain realized or assumed tax benefits PBF Energy may claim arising in connection with prior offerings and future exchanges of PBF LLC Series A Units for shares of its Class A common stock and related transactions. The indentures governing the senior notes allow PBF LLC, under certain circumstances, to make distributions sufficient for PBF Energy to pay its obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nPBF Energy is party to a Tax Receivable Agreement that provides for the payment from time to time by PBF Energy to the current and former holders of PBF LLC Series A Units and PBF LLC Series B Units of 85% of the benefits, if any, that PBF Energy is deemed to realize as a result of (i) the increases in tax basis resulting from its acquisitions of PBF LLC Series A Units, including such acquisitions in connection with its prior offerings or in the future and (ii) certain other tax benefits related to its entering into the Tax Receivable Agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. See \u201cItem 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\u201d\nPBF Energy has recognized, as of December 31, 2021, a liability for the Tax Receivable Agreement of $48.3 million, reflecting the estimated undiscounted amounts that PBF Energy expects to pay under the agreement, net of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance recognized in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 740, Income Taxes (\u201cASC 740\u201d). As future taxable income is recorded, increases in our Tax Receivable Agreement liability may be necessary in conjunction with the revaluation of deferred tax assets. If PBF Energy does not have taxable income, PBF Energy generally is not required (absent a change of control or circumstances requiring an early termination payment) to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for that taxable year because no benefit will have been actually realized. However, any tax benefits that do not result in realized benefits in a given tax year will likely generate tax attributes that may be utilized to generate benefits in previous or future tax years. The utilization of such tax attributes will result in payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The foregoing are merely estimates based on assumptions that are subject to change due to various factors, including, among other factors, the timing of exchanges of PBF LLC Series A Units for shares of PBF Energy Class A common stock as contemplated by the Tax Receivable Agreement, the price of PBF Energy Class A common stock at the time of such exchanges, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable, and the amount and timing of PBF Energy\u2019s income. The actual payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement could differ materially. It is possible that future transactions or events could increase the actual tax benefits realized and the corresponding Tax Receivable Agreement payments. There may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if, as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise, (i) the payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement exceed the actual benefits PBF Energy realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement, and/or (ii) distributions to PBF Energy by PBF LLC are not sufficient to permit PBF Energy, after it has paid its taxes and other obligations, to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are not conditioned upon any recipient\u2019s continued ownership of us.\nIn certain cases, payments by PBF Energy under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits it realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. These provisions may deter a change in control of the Company.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement provides that upon certain changes of control, or if, at any time, PBF Energy elects an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, PBF Energy\u2019s (or its successor\u2019s) obligations with respect to exchanged or acquired PBF LLC Series A Units (whether exchanged or acquired before or after such transaction) would be based on certain assumptions, including (i) that PBF Energy would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits related to entering into the Tax Receivable Agreement and (ii) that the subsidiaries of PBF LLC will sell certain nonamortizable assets (and realize certain related tax benefits) no later than a specified date. Moreover, in each of these instances, PBF Energy would be required to make an immediate payment equal to the present value (at a discount rate equal to the London Interbank Offering Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) plus 100 basis points) of the anticipated future tax benefits (based on the foregoing assumptions). Accordingly, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be made years in advance of the actual realization, if any, of the anticipated future tax benefits and may be significantly greater than the actual benefits PBF Energy realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. In these situations, PBF Energy\u2019s obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity. PBF Energy may not be able to finance its obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement and its existing indebtedness may limit its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make distributions to PBF Energy to pay these obligations. These provisions may deter a potential sale of our Company to a third-party and may otherwise make it less likely that a third-party would enter into a change of control transaction with us.\nMoreover, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that PBF Energy determines in accordance with the Tax Receivable Agreement. PBF Energy will not be reimbursed for any payments previously made under the Tax Receivable Agreement if the Internal Revenue Service subsequently disallows part or all of the tax benefits that gave rise to such prior payments. As a result, in certain circumstances, payments could be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement that are significantly in excess of the benefits that PBF Energy actually realized in respect of (i) the increases in tax basis resulting from our purchases or exchanges of PBF LLC Series A Units and (ii) certain other tax benefits related to PBF Energy entering into the Tax Receivable Agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nAnti-takeover and certain other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may discourage or delay a change in control.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u2022prohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022restrict certain business combinations with stockholders who obtain beneficial ownership of a certain percentage of our outstanding common stock;\n\u2022provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the Board of Directors, the chief executive officer or the Board of Directors, and establish advance notice procedures for the nomination of candidates for election as directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022provide that our stockholders may only amend our bylaws with the approval of 75% or more of all of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote.\nThese anti-takeover provisions and other provisions of Delaware law may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company. Certain provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of PBF Energy Class A common stock.\nThe market price of PBF Energy Class A common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline.\nThe market price of PBF Energy Class A common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations due to a number of factors including:\n\u2022market conditions in the oil refining industry and volatility in commodity prices and the ongoing impact of COVID-19;\n\u2022changes in, or failure to meet, earnings estimates of securities analysts;\n\u2022variations in actual or anticipated operating results or dividends, if any, to stockholders;\n\u2022the impact of disruptions to crude or feedstock supply to any of our refineries, including disruptions due to problems with third-party logistics infrastructure;\n\u2022litigation and government investigations;\n\u2022the timing and announcement of any potential acquisitions or divestitures and subsequent impact of any future acquisitions or divestitures on our capital structure, financial condition or results of operations;\n\u2022changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations or enforcement thereof;\n\u2022general economic and stock market conditions; and\n\u2022the availability for sale, or sales by PBF Energy or its senior management, of a significant number of shares of its Class A common stock in the public market.\nIn addition, the stock markets generally may experience significant volatility, often unrelated to the operating performance of the individual companies whose securities are publicly-traded. These and other factors may cause the market price of PBF Energy Class A common stock to decrease significantly, which in turn would adversely affect the value of your investment.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation.\nOur current stockholders could experience dilution, which could further depress the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe continue to require substantial working capital to fund our business. We may sell equity securities or convertible securities or other derivative securities in the public or private markets if we continue to need capital, and even when conditions or terms are not otherwise favorable, including at prices at or below the then current market price of our shares of Class A common stock. As a result, stockholders may experience substantial dilution, and the market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of the introduction of a large number of shares of our Class A common stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our Class A common stock, into the market or the perception that these sales could occur. Sales of a large number of shares of our Class A common stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our Class A common stock, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. In addition, any equity securities we issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our Class A common stock, and our current debt agreements contain, and any agreements for future debt or preferred equity financings, if available, are likely to contain, covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt. Holders of Class A common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on our capital needs as well as market conditions and other factors beyond om control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, nature or impact of future issuances, if any. Our Class A common stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the per share market price of our Class A common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Ownership of PBFX\nWe depend upon PBFX for a substantial portion of our refineries\u2019 logistics needs and have obligations for minimum volume commitments in our commercial agreements with PBFX.\nWe depend on PBFX to receive, handle, store and transfer crude oil, petroleum products and natural gas for us from our operations and sources located throughout the United States and Canada in support of certain of our refineries under long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with our subsidiaries. These commercial agreements have an initial term ranging from one to fifteen years and generally include minimum quarterly commitments and inflation escalators. If we fail to meet the minimum commitments during any calendar quarter, we will be required to make a shortfall payment quarterly to PBFX equal to the volume of the shortfall multiplied by the applicable fee.\nPBFX\u2019s operations are subject to all of the risks and operational hazards inherent in receiving, handling, storing and transferring crude oil, petroleum products and natural gas, including: damages to its facilities, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by floods, fires, severe weather, explosions and other natural disasters and acts of terrorism; mechanical or structural failures at PBFX\u2019s facilities or at third-party facilities on which its operations are dependent; curtailments of operations relative to severe seasonal weather; inadvertent damage to our facilities from construction, farm and utility equipment; and other hazards. Any of these events or factors could result in severe damage or destruction to PBFX\u2019s assets or the temporary or permanent shut-down of PBFX\u2019s facilities. If PBFX is unable to serve our logistics needs, our ability to operate our refineries and receive crude oil and distribute products could be adversely impacted, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2021, PBF LLC owns 29,953,631 common units representing 47.9% limited partner interest in PBFX. The inability of PBFX to continue operations, perform under its commercial arrangements with our subsidiaries or the occurrence of any of these risks or operational hazards, could also adversely impact the value of our investment in PBFX and, because PBFX is a consolidated entity, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPBF Energy will be required to pay taxes on its share of taxable income from PBF LLC and its other subsidiary flow-through entities (including PBFX), regardless of the amount of cash distributions PBF Energy receives from PBF LLC.\nThe holders of limited liability company interests in PBF LLC, including PBF Energy, generally have to include for purposes of calculating their U.S. federal, state and local income taxes their share of any taxable income of PBF LLC, regardless of whether such holders receive cash distributions from PBF LLC. PBF Energy ultimately may not receive cash distributions from PBF LLC equal to its share of the taxable income of PBF LLC or even equal to the actual tax due with respect to that income. For example, PBF LLC is required to include in taxable income PBF LLC\u2019s allocable share of PBFX\u2019s taxable income and gains (such share to be determined pursuant to the partnership agreement of PBFX), regardless of the amount of cash distributions received by PBF LLC from PBFX, and such taxable income and gains will flow-through to PBF Energy to the extent of its allocable share of the taxable income of PBF LLC. As a result, at certain times, the amount of cash otherwise ultimately available to PBF Energy on account of its indirect interest in PBFX may not be sufficient for PBF Energy to pay the amount of taxes it will owe on account of its indirect interests in PBFX.\nIf PBFX was to be treated as a corporation, rather than as a partnership, for U.S. federal income tax purposes or if PBFX was otherwise subject to entity-level taxation, PBFX\u2019s cash available for distribution to its unitholders, including to us, would be reduced, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of units, including the units held by us.\nThe present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly-traded partnerships, including PBFX, or an investment in its common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial interpretation at any time. For example, from time to time the U.S. Congress considers substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that would affect publicly-traded partnerships. Any modification to the U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible for PBFX to meet the exception to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes, or other proposals, will ultimately be enacted. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in PBFX common units.\nIf PBFX were treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would pay U.S. federal income tax on income at the corporate tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 21% under the TCJA, and would likely be liable for state income tax at varying rates. Distributions to PBFX unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses, deductions or credits would flow through to PBFX unitholders. Because taxes would be imposed upon PBFX as a corporation, the cash available for distribution to PBFX unitholders would be substantially reduced. Therefore, PBFX\u2019s treatment as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to PBFX unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of the units.\nAll of the executive officers and a majority of the directors of PBF GP are also current or former officers or directors of PBF Energy. Conflicts of interest could arise as a result of this arrangement.\nPBF Energy indirectly owns and controls PBF GP, and appoints all of its officers and directors. All of the executive officers and a majority of the directors of PBF GP are also current or former officers or directors of PBF Energy. These individuals will devote significant time to the business of PBFX. Although the directors and officers of PBF GP have a fiduciary duty to manage PBF GP in a manner that is beneficial to PBF Energy, as directors and officers of PBF GP they also have certain duties to PBFX and its unitholders. Conflicts of interest may arise between PBF Energy and its affiliates, including PBF GP, on the one hand, and PBFX and its unitholders, on the other hand. In resolving these conflicts of interest, PBF GP may favor its own interests and the interests of PBFX over the interests of PBF Energy. In certain circumstances, PBF GP may refer any conflicts of interest or potential conflicts of interest between PBFX, on the one hand, and PBF Energy, on the other hand, to its conflicts committee (which must consist entirely of independent directors) for resolution, which conflicts committee must act in the best interests of the public unitholders of PBFX. As a result, PBF GP may manage the business of PBFX in a way that may differ from the best interests of PBF Energy or its stockholders.", "PERMNO": 13730, "SIC": 2911, "TIC": "PBF"}
