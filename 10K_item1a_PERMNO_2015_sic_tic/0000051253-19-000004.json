{"cik": "51253", "company": "INTERNATIONAL FLAVORS & FRAGRANCES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS.\nWe routinely encounter and address risks in conducting our business. Some of these risks may cause our future results to be different - sometimes materially different - than we presently anticipate. Below are material risks we have identified that could adversely affect our business. How we react to material future developments, as well as how our competitors and customers react to those developments, could also affect our future results\nWe may not realize the benefits anticipated from the Frutarom acquisition, which could adversely affect our business.\nPart of our growth strategy has included growth through acquisitions within the fragrance, flavors, natural ingredient industries and adjacencies. The Frutarom acquisition was our most significant acquisition and brings a significantly different customer base and new adjacent product categories to our business. Our expectations about the benefits of this acquisition are based on projections and assumptions about our combined businesses which depend on (i) our ability to maintain the current Frutarom business, (ii) our ability to achieve the anticipated synergies and (iii) our ability to cross-sell the combined company\u2019s products. We may encounter significant challenges achieving these anticipated benefits, including the following:\n\u2022\npotential disruption of, or reduced growth in, our historical core businesses, due to diversion of management attention from our historical core business and uncertainty with our current customer and supplier relationships;\n\u2022\nchallenges arising from the expansion of our product offerings into adjacencies with which we have limited experience, including functional foods and nutraceuticals;\n\u2022\ncoordinating and integrating research and development teams across technologies and products to enhance product development while reducing costs;\n\u2022\nconsolidating and integrating corporate, information technology, finance and administrative infrastructures, and integrating and harmonizing business systems, which may be more difficult than anticipated due to the significant number of acquisitions completed by Frutarom over the past few years;\n\u2022\ncoordinating sales and marketing efforts to effectively position our capabilities and the direction of product development;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities, cross-selling opportunities and growth prospects from combining Frutarom\u2019s business with our business;\n\u2022\nthe increased scale, regulatory compliance costs and complexity of our operations;\n\u2022\nretaining key employees, suppliers and other partners;\n\u2022\nretaining and efficiently managing Frutarom\u2019s significantly expanded and decentralized customer base;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in anticipating and responding to actions that may be taken by competitors in response to the transaction; and\n\u2022\nthe assumption of and exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of Frutarom.\nIn addition, our anticipated benefits of the acquisition of Frutarom contemplate significant cost-saving synergies, which we expect to arise principally from facility consolidation and rationalization of supply chain relationships. Even if we are able to successfully integrate the operations of Frutarom with ours, we may not realize the full benefits of the acquisition if we are unable to identify and implement the anticipated cost savings or if the actions taken to implement such cost-savings have unintended consequences on our other business operations.\nIf we do not successfully manage these issues and the other challenges inherent in integrating Frutarom, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, we could incur unanticipated expenses and charges and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Frutarom acquisition resulted, and may continue to result, in significant charges or other liabilities that could adversely affect the financial results of the combined company.\nOur financial results, following the acquisition of Frutarom, were adversely affected by cash expenses and non-cash accounting charges incurred in connection with the acquisition. We expect these types of charges to continue as a result of the integration of the business and operations of Frutarom. As a result of the acquisition, we assumed all of Frutarom\u2019s liabilities, including unknown and contingent liabilities. Due to the nature of the transaction and the characteristics of Frutarom, our ability to conduct extensive due diligence was limited and we may subsequently identify additional obligations, including those that Frutarom assumed in its prior acquisitions, during the measurement period. Prior to our acquisition, Frutarom completed 47 acquisitions since 2011, including 22 since the beginning of 2016. Our ability to accurately identify and assess the magnitude of the liabilities assumed by Frutarom in these acquisitions was limited by, among other things, the information available to us and Frutarom and the limited operating experience that Frutarom has with these acquired entities. If we are not able to completely assess the scope of these liabilities or if these liabilities are neither probable nor estimable at this time, our future financial results could be adversely affected by unanticipated reserves or charges, unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting charges, unexpected increases in taxes due, a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nOur incurrence of additional debt to pay the cash portion of the Frutarom consideration increased our financial leverage and could adversely affect our future cash flows and cost of capital.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Frutarom, we borrowed approximately $3.3 billion of additional debt, consisting of $2.8 billion of senior unsecured notes, $350.0 million in term loans and $139.5 million of senior unsecured amortizing notes associated with the tangible equity units. Incurring this new debt significantly increased our leverage. There may be circumstances in which required payments of principal and/or interest on this new debt could adversely affect our cash flows, our operating results or our ability to return capital to our shareholders through dividends or stock repurchases. Furthermore, our degree of leverage could adversely affect our future credit ratings. If we are unable to maintain or improve our current investment grade rating, it could adversely affect our future cost of funding, liquidity and access to capital markets. In addition, our current level of leverage could increase our vulnerability to sustained, adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit our ability to obtain further financing, and our ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities, including large acquisitions.\nIf we are unable to successfully market to our expanded and decentralized Taste and Frutarom customer base, our operating results and future growth may be adversely affected.\nAs a result of our acquisition of Frutarom, the number of our customers significantly increased and became more decentralized. Our historical customer base was primarily comprised of large food, beverage and consumer products companies. These customers have faced, in recent years, growing competition from mid- and small-sized regional companies and companies focused on niche-product categories. In connection with Vision 2020, we identified serving these small and mid-sized clients as a key element of our business strategy and invested in this strategy through the introduction of Tastepoint by IFF in the US, which resulted from the acquisitions of Ottens Flavors and David Michael. With the Frutarom acquisition, we have significantly expanded our customer base, by approximately 39,000 customers, composed principally of globally-located small and mid-sized companies. This substantial increase in our customer base will require us to adjust our corporate, information technology, finance and administrative infrastructures and corporate sales and customer culture. Further, we may experience difficulty managing the growth of a portfolio of customers that is diverse both with respect to the types of services they will require and the infrastructure required to deliver our products. However, if we are unable to successfully implement this strategy or gain market share with this growing customer base, our future growth could be adversely affected.\nOur business is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively our sales and results of operations will suffer.\nThe market for flavors, fragrances and natural ingredients is highly competitive. We face vigorous competition from companies throughout the world, including multi-national and specialized flavor, fragrance and cosmetic ingredients companies, as well as consumer product companies who may develop their own flavors, fragrances or cosmetic ingredients. In the flavors industry, we also face increasing competition from ingredient suppliers that have expanded their portfolios to include flavor offerings. Some of our competitors specialize in one or more of our product sub-segments, while others participate in many of our product sub-segments. In addition, some of our global competitors may have greater resources than we do or may have proprietary products that could permit them to respond to changing business and economic conditions more effectively than we can. Consolidation of our competitors may exacerbate these risks.\nAs we continue to enter into adjacent markets, such as cosmetic ingredients and, recently through the Frutarom acquisition, functional foods, specialty fine ingredients and health and wellness products, we may face greater competition-related risks in these markets than with our core historic flavor and fragrances businesses. For example, the specialty fine ingredients market is more price sensitive than the flavors market and is characterized by relatively lower profit margins. Some fine ingredients products manufactured by Frutarom are less unique and more replaceable by competitors\u2019 products. There is no assurance that operating margins will not erode in the future, which could substantially impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nCompetition in our business is based on innovation, product quality, regulatory compliance, pricing, quality of customer service, the support provided by marketing and application groups, and understanding of consumers. It is difficult for us to predict the timing, scale and success of our competitors\u2019 actions in these areas. In particular, the discovery and development of new flavors and fragrance compounds and ingredients, protection of our intellectual property and development and retention of key employees are critical to our ability to effectively compete in our business. Increased competition by existing or future competitors, including aggressive price competition, could result in the potential loss of substantial sales or create the need for us to reduce prices or increase spending, and this could have an adverse impact on sales and profitability.\nIf we are unable to provide our customers with innovative, cost-effective products that allow them to achieve their own profitability expectations, our sales and results of operations will suffer.\nDuring 2018, our 25 largest customers accounted for 47% of our sales, and the largest customer across all end-use categories accounted for 9% to 12 % of our sales for each of the last three fiscal years. Loss of or a reduction in sales to our largest customer or any of our other large customers for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nLarge multi-national customers, and increasingly, middle-market customers are unilaterally limiting the number of their suppliers or rationalizing the number of products that they offer to increase their margins and profitability. As part of these initiatives, these customers are creating \u201ccore lists\u201d of suppliers and giving these \u201ccore lists\u201d suppliers priority for new or modified products. Recently, these customers are making inclusion on their \u201ccore lists\u201d contingent upon a supplier providing more favorable commercial terms, including rebates, which could adversely affect our margins. We must either offer competitive cost-in-use solutions to secure and maintain inclusion on these \u201ccore lists\u201d or seek to manage the relationship without being on the \u201ccore-list\u201d. If we chose not to pursue \u201ccore-list\u201d status due to profitability concerns or if we are unable to obtain \u201ccore-list\u201d status our ability to maintain our share of the customers\u2019 future purchases could be adversely affected and therefore our future results of operations.\nFurthermore, consolidations amongst our customers have resulted in larger and more sophisticated customers with greater buying power and additional negotiating strength. These and other profitability initiatives being pursued by our customers reduce the market opportunity for which we compete and subject the volume and pricing of the remaining suppliers to downward pressure. To be successful in this competitive environment, we must continue to make investments in customer relationships and tailor product research and development in order to anticipate customers\u2019 needs, deliver products that contribute to our customers\u2019 profitability, and provide effective customer service.\nWe may not successfully develop and introduce new products that meet our customers\u2019 needs, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur ability to differentiate ourselves and deliver growth in line with our Vision 2020 strategy largely depends on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and product improvements that meet our customers\u2019 needs, and ultimately appeal to consumers. Innovation is a key element of our ability to develop and introduce new products. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in achieving our innovation goals, such as the development of new molecules, new and\nexpanded delivery systems and other technologies. We currently spend approximately 8% of our sales on research and development; however, such investments may only generate future revenues to the extent that we are able to develop products that meet our customers\u2019 specifications, are at an acceptable cost and achieve acceptance by the targeted consumer market. Furthermore, there may be significant lag times from the time we incur R&D costs to the time that these R&D costs may result in increased revenue. Consequently, even when we \u201cwin\u201d a project, our ability to generate revenues as a result of these investments is subject to numerous customer, economic and other risks that are outside of our control, including delays by our customers in the launch of a new product, the level of promotional support for the launch, poor performance of our third-party vendors, anticipated sales by our customers not being realized or changes in market preferences or demands, or disruptive innovations by competitors.\nA disruption in our manufacturing operations or our supply chain could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nAs a company engaged in the global development, manufacture and distribution of products, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, product quality control issues, safety, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as well as natural disasters, international conflicts, terrorist acts and other external factors over which we have no control. While we operate research and development, manufacturing and distribution facilities throughout the world, many of these facilities are extremely specialized and certain of our R&D or creative laboratories facilities are uniquely situated to support our research and development efforts while certain of our manufacturing facilities are the sole location where a specific ingredient or product is produced. If our research and development activities or the manufacturing of ingredients or products were disrupted, the cost of relocating or replacing these activities or reformulating these ingredients or products may be substantial, which could result in production or development delays or otherwise have an adverse effect on our margins, operating results and future growth.\nA disruption in our supply chain, including the inability to obtain ingredients and raw materials from third parties, could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIn connection with our manufacture of our fragrance and flavor compounds, we often rely on third party suppliers for ingredients and raw materials that are integral to our manufacture of such compounds. Our purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather, climate change, growing and harvesting conditions, market conditions, governmental actions and other factors beyond our control. Our natural products and ingredients may also be subject to import alerts or specific country regulations that would impair our ability to obtain sufficient quantity at the relevant manufacturing facility. In addition, our ingredient suppliers, similar to us, are subject to the risks inherent in manufacturing and distribution on a global scale, including industrial accidents, environmental events, strikes and other labor disputes, disruptions in supply chain or information systems, disruption or loss of key research or manufacturing sites, product quality control, safety and environmental compliance issues, licensing requirements and other regulatory issues, as well as natural disasters, international conflicts, terrorist acts and other external factors over which they have no control. These suppliers also could become insolvent or experience other financial distress. For example, a fire at the manufacturing facility of BASF Group (\u201cBASF\u201d), one of our suppliers, in 2017 caused them to declare a force majeure and has resulted in a disruption of the availability of certain ingredients used in some of our fragrance and flavor compounds. If our suppliers are unable to supply us with sufficient ingredients and raw materials to meet our needs, we would need to seek alternative sources of such materials or pursue our own production of such ingredients or direct acquisition of such raw materials. However, for certain of our raw ingredients and raw materials we rely on a limited number of suppliers where there are not readily available alternatives. If we are unable to obtain or manufacture alternative sources of such ingredients or raw materials at a similar cost, we would seek to (i) reformulate our compounds and/or (ii) increase pricing to reflect the higher supply cost. However, if we are not able to successfully implement any of these alternatives, we could experience disruptions in production, increased cost of sales and a corresponding decrease in gross margin or reduced sales if our competitors were able to more successfully adjust to such market disruption. Such fluctuations and decrease in gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nVolatility and increases in the price of raw materials, energy and transportation could harm our profits.\nWe use many different raw materials for our business, including essential oils, extracts and concentrates derived from fruits, vegetables, flowers, woods and other botanicals, animal products, raw fruits, organic chemicals and petroleum-based chemicals. Historically, we have experienced a considerable amount of price volatility in natural products that represent approximately half of our raw material purchases, and we expect this volatility to continue in the near future. For example, during and in 2018, we experienced increases in the prices of certain naturals, including citrus. In addition, because Frutarom\u2019s number of natural product offerings is substantial, this risk may be exacerbated. Availability and pricing of these natural products can be impacted by crop size and quality, weather, climate change, alternative land use, and other factors which we cannot control.\nIf we are unable to increase the prices to our customers of our flavor or fragrance compounds or natural ingredient products to offset raw material and other input cost increases, or if we are unable to achieve cost savings to offset such cost increases, we could fail to meet our cost expectations and our profits and operating results could be adversely affected. Increases in prices of our products to customers may lead to declines in volume, and we may not be able to accurately predict the volume impact of price increases, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nSimilarly, commodities and energy prices are subject to significant volatility caused by market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuations, production and transportation disruptions, and other world events. As we source many of our raw materials globally to help ensure quality control, if the cost of energy, shipping or transportation increases and we are unable to pass along these costs to our customers, our profit margins would be adversely affected. Furthermore, increasing our prices to our customers could result in long-term sales declines or loss of market share if our customers find alternative suppliers or choose to reformulate their consumer products to use fewer ingredients, which could have an adverse long-term impact on our results of operations.\nTo mitigate our sourcing risk, we maintain strategic stock levels for critical items. However, if we do not accurately estimate the amount of raw materials that will be used for the geographic region in which we will need these materials, our margins could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to comply with regulatory requirements and industry standards, including those regarding product safety, quality, efficacy and environmental impact, we could incur significant costs and suffer reputational harm which could adversely affect results of operations.\nThe development, manufacture and sale of our products are subject to various regulatory requirements in each of the countries in which our products are developed, manufactured and sold. In addition, we are subject to product safety and compliance requirements established by the industry or similar oversight bodies or contractually by our customers, including requirements concerning product safety, quality and efficacy, environmental impacts (including packaging, energy and water use and waste management) and other sustainability or similar issues. We use a variety of strategies, methodologies and tools to (i) identify current product standards, (ii) assess relative risks in our supply chain that can impact product integrity, (iii) monitor internal and external performance and (iv) test raw materials and finished goods to minimize the likelihood of product or process non-compliance.\nGaps in our operational processes or those of our suppliers can result in products that do not meet our quality control standards or industry standards or fail to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements, which in turn can result in finished consumer goods that do not comply with these standards and requirements. Products that are mislabeled, contaminated or damaged could result in a regulatory non-compliance event or even a product recall by the FDA or a similar foreign agency. Our contracts often require us to indemnify our customers for the costs associated with a product non-compliance event, including penalties, costs and settlements arising from litigation, remediation costs or loss of sales. As our flavors and fragrance compounds and ingredients are used in many products intended for human use or consumption, these consequences would be exacerbated if we or our customer did not identify the defect before the product reaches the consumer and there was a resulting impact at the consumer level. Such a result could lead to potentially large scale adverse publicity, negative effects on consumer\u2019s health, recalls and potential consumer litigation. In addition, if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification from suppliers or other third parties, or if insurance or indemnification is not available, the liability relating to product or possible third-party claims arising from mislabeled, contaminated or damaged products could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, adverse publicity about our products, or our customers\u2019 products that contain our ingredients, including concerns about product safety or similar issues, whether real or perceived, could harm our reputation and result in an immediate adverse effect on our sales and customer relationships, as well as require us to utilize significant resources to rebuild our reputation.\nThe interruption or failure of key information technology systems or a loss of data, malicious attack or other breach of security of our information technology systems, may have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business, subject us to increased operating costs, damage our reputation and expose us to litigation.\nWe rely on information technology systems, including some managed by third-party providers, to conduct business and support our business processes, including product formulas, product development, sales, order processing, production, distribution, internal communications and communications with third parties throughout the world, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, tax or legal requirements, and collecting and storing customer, supplier, employee and other stakeholder information. The Frutarom acquisition may also pose additional burden on our information technology systems as we integrate our information and financial systems into our newly acquired facilities. These systems may be susceptible to disruptions or outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, natural disasters, cyber-attacks, failed upgrades or other similar events, or due to the poor performance of third-party\nproviders. An effective response to disruptions will require effort and diligence on the part of our employees and third-party providers to avoid any adverse impact to our business. In addition, our systems and proprietary data stored electronically may be vulnerable to computer viruses, cybercrime, computer hacking and similar information security breaches, which in turn could result in the unauthorized release or misuse of confidential or proprietary information about our business (including, but not limited to, the trade secrets upon which we rely to protect our proprietary fragrance and flavor formulations), employees, or customers, and disrupt our operations. Depending on their nature and scope, these threats could potentially lead to improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data or product non-compliance. The occurrence of any of these events could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our sales, subject us to increased operating costs, damage our reputation and expose us to litigation or regulatory proceedings.\nIncreasing awareness of health and wellness are driving changes in the consumer products industry, and if we are unable to react in a timely and cost-effective manner, our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected.\nWe must continually anticipate and react, in a timely and cost-effective manner, to changes in consumer preferences and demands, including changes in demand driven by increasing awareness of health and wellness and demands for transparency with respect to product ingredients. Consumers, especially in developed economies such as the U.S. and Western Europe, are shifting away from products containing artificial ingredients to all natural, healthier alternatives. In addition, there has been a growing demand by consumers, non-governmental organizations and, to a lesser extent, governmental agencies to provide more transparency in product labeling and our customers have been taking steps to address this demand, including by voluntarily providing product-specific ingredients disclosure. These two trends could affect the types and volumes of our ingredients and compounds that our customers include in their consumer product offerings. If we are unable to react to or anticipate these trends in a timely and cost-effective manner, our results of operations and future growth may be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to successfully establish and manage collaborations, joint ventures or partnerships that lead to development or commercialization of products, it could adversely affect our growth.\nFrom time to time, we evaluate and enter into collaborations, joint ventures or partnerships to enhance our research and development efforts or expand our materials portfolio or technology. The process of establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships is difficult and time-consuming to negotiate, document and implement. We may not be able to successfully negotiate these arrangements or the terms of the arrangements may not be as favorable as anticipated. Furthermore, our ability to generate revenues from such collaborations will depend on our partners\u2019 abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements and these collaborations may not lead to development or commercialization of products in the most efficient manner, or at all. In addition, from time to time, Frutarom has acquired, and we intend to continue to acquire, only a majority interest in companies and providing earnouts for the former owners and the ability for us to acquire the minority interests at a future date at an established price. These investments may have additional risks and may not be as efficient as other operations as we may have fiduciary or contractual obligations to the minority investors. If we are unable to successfully establish and manage these collaborative relationships and majority investments it could adversely affect our future growth.\nWe have made investments in and continue to expand our business into emerging markets, which exposes us to certain risks.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have increased our presence in emerging markets by expanding our manufacturing presence, sales organization and product offerings in these markets, and we expect to continue to expand our business in these markets. With our combination with Frutarom, who also had a significant presence in emerging markets, our business in these markets has meaningfully grown. In addition to the currency and international risks described below, our operations in these markets may be subject to a variety of other risks. Emerging markets typically have a consumer base with limited or fluctuating disposable income and customer demand in these markets may fluctuate accordingly. As a result, decrease in customer demand in emerging markets may have an adverse effect on our ability to execute our growth strategy. Further, there is no assurance that our existing products, variants of our existing products or new products that we make, manufacture, distribute or sell will be accepted or be successful in any particular developing or emerging market, due to local or global competition, product price, cultural differences, consumer preferences or otherwise. In addition, emerging markets may have weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights, exchange controls, unstable governments and privatization or other government actions that may affect taxes, subsidies and incentive programs and the flow of goods and currency. In conducting our business, we move products from one country to another and may provide services in one country from a subsidiary located in another country. Accordingly, we are vulnerable to abrupt changes in trade, customs and tax regimes in these markets. If we are unable to expand our business in developing and emerging\nmarkets, effectively operate, or manage the risks associated with operating in these markets, or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets, our operating results and future growth could be adversely affected.\nThe impact of currency fluctuation or devaluation in the international markets in which we operate may negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe have significant operations outside the US, the results of which are reported in the local currency and then translated into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. The exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated and will continue to do so in the future. For example, as of July 1, 2018, we concluded that Argentina\u2019s economy is highly inflationary under US GAAP, as it has experienced cumulative inflation of approximately 100% or more over a three-year period. While our current operations in Argentina represent less than 3% of our consolidated net sales and less than 1% of our consolidated total assets, continuing inflation in Argentina could adversely affect our profitability in a specific period. With our increased operations in emerging markets arising from our Frutarom acquisition, these risks will become exacerbated. Changes in exchange rates between these local currencies and the U.S. dollar will affect the recorded levels of sales, profitability, assets and/or liabilities. Additionally, volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial condition, cash flows or liquidity. Although we employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, including sourcing strategies and a limited number of foreign currency hedging activities, we cannot guarantee that such hedging and risk management strategies will be effective, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur international operations are subject to regulatory, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues, cash flows or financial position.\nWe operate on a global basis, with manufacturing and sales facilities in the US, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, Israel and Greater Asia. During 2018, 75% of our net sales and, as a result of our acquisition of Frutarom, 80% of our combined net sales were to customers outside the U.S. and we intend to continue expansion of our international operations. As a result, our business is increasingly exposed to risks inherent in international operations. These risks, which can vary substantially by location, include the following:\n\u2022\ngovernmental laws, regulations and policies adopted to manage national economic and macroeconomic conditions, such as increases in taxes, austerity measures that may impact consumer spending, monetary policies that may impact inflation rates, currency fluctuations and sustainability of resources;\n\u2022\nchanges in environmental, health and safety regulations, such as the continued implementation of the European Union\u2019s REACH regulations and similar regulations that are being evaluated and adopted in other markets, and the burdens and costs of our compliance with such regulations;\n\u2022\nincreased environmental, health and safety regulations or the loss of necessary environmental permits in certain countries, arising from growing consumer sensitivity concerning the inclusion of flavor additives in food products and the fact that regulators perceive nutraceuticals, medical food and functional food products as having medicinal attributes;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of or changes in tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, by the U.S. or other Countries, which could adversely affect our cost or ability to import raw materials or export our flavors and fragrance products to surrounding markets;\n\u2022\nrisks and costs arising from language and cultural differences;\n\u2022\nchanges in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment in the countries in which we operate, including the risk of expropriation or nationalization, and the costs and ability to repatriate the profit that we generate in these countries;\n\u2022\nrisks and costs associated with political and economic instability, bribery and corruption, anti-American sentiment, and social and ethnic unrest in the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in recruiting and retaining trained local personnel;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, pandemics or international conflicts, including terrorist acts, or national and regional labor strikes in the countries in which we operate, which could interrupt our operations or endanger our personnel; or\n\u2022\nthe risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation, application and enforceability of laws and regulations and the enforceability of contract rights and intellectual property rights.\nThe occurrence of any one or more of these factors could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations.\nEconomic uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products which may have a negative impact on our operating results and future growth.\nOur flavors and fragrance compounds and our fragrance, cosmetic active and functional food ingredients are components of a wide assortment of global consumer products throughout the world. Historically, demand for consumer products using these compounds and ingredients was stimulated and broadened by changing social habits and consumer needs, population growth, an expanding global middle-class and general economic growth, especially in emerging markets. The global economy has experienced significant recessionary pressures and declines in consumer confidence and economic growth. While some segments of the global economy appear to be recovering, the predictions surrounding the global recessionary economic environment in Europe has, and may in the near future, increase unemployment and underemployment, decrease salaries and wage rates, increase inflation or result in other market-wide cost pressures that will adversely affect demand for consumer products in both developed and emerging markets. In addition, growth rates in the emerging markets have moderated from previous levels. Reduced consumer spending may cause changes in our customer orders including reduced demand for our flavors and fragrances compounds or ingredients, or order cancellations.\nThe timing of placing of orders and the amounts of these orders are generally at our customers' discretion. Customers may cancel, reduce or postpone orders with us on relatively short notice. Significant cancellations, reductions or delays in orders by customers could affect our quarterly results.\nIt is currently anticipated that these challenging economic uncertainties will continue to affect certain of our markets during 2019 which could adversely affect our sales, profitability and overall operating results.\nOur success depends on attracting and retaining talented people within our business. Significant shortfalls in recruitment or retention could adversely affect our ability to compete and achieve our strategic goals.\nAttracting, developing, and retaining talented employees, including our perfumers, scientists and flavorists, is essential to the successful delivery of our products and success in the marketplace. Furthermore, as we continue to focus on innovation, our need for scientists and other professionals will increase. An important factor in our ability to realize our anticipated benefits from the Frutarom acquisition is our ability to retain key employees at Frutarom. The ability to attract and retain talented employees is critical in the development of new products and technologies which is an integral component of our growth strategy.\nCompetition for employees can be intense and if we are unable to successfully integrate, motivate and reward the acquired Frutarom employees or our current employees in our combined company, we may not be able to retain them. However, if we are unable to retain these employees or attract new employees in the future, our ability to effectively compete with our competitors and to grow our business could be adversely affected.\nFailure to comply with environmental protection laws may cause us to close, relocate or operate one or more of our plants at reduced production levels, and expose us to civil or criminal liability, which could adversely affect our operating results and future growth.\nOur business operations and properties make use of, manufacture, sell, and distribute substances that are sometimes considered hazardous and are therefore subject to extensive and increasingly stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to protection of the environment, including air emissions, sewage discharges, the use of hazardous materials, waste disposal practices and clean-up of existing environmental contamination. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or any future changes to them may result in significant consequences to us, including the need to close or relocate one or more of our production facilities, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, liability for damages and negative publicity. If we are unable to meet production requirements, we can lose customer orders, which can adversely affect our future growth or we may be required to make incremental capital investments to ensure supply. For example, in 2015 Chinese authorities notified us of compliance issues pertaining to the emission of odors from several of our plants in China and, consequently, we invested approximately $6.5 million in odor-abatement equipment at these facilities and have built a second flavors manufacturing facility in China, with an estimated cost of $45 million. We have also recently completed negotiations with the Chinese government concerning the relocation of a second Fragrance facility in China. Idling of facilities or production modifications has caused or may cause customers to seek alternate suppliers due to concerns regarding supply interruptions and these customers may not return or may order at reduced levels even once issues are remediated. If these non-compliance issues reoccur in China or occur or in any other jurisdiction, we may lose business and may be required to incur capital spending above previous expectations, close a plant, or operate a plant at significantly reduced production levels on a permanent basis, and our operating results and cash flows from operations may be adversely affected.\nOur ongoing optimization of our manufacturing facilities may not be as effective as we anticipate, and we may fail to realize the expected cost savings and increased efficiencies.\nAs part of our ongoing strategy, we seek to enhance our manufacturing efficiency and align our geographic manufacturing footprint with our expectations of future growth and technology needs.\nFor example, we are in the process of relocating one of our Fragrance Ingredients facilities in China, constructing new facilities in India and Indonesia, and other capital projects required to integrate our recently acquired Frutarom business. The spending associated with these projects may result in capital spending above previous expectations, which could adversely affect our cash flows.\nIn addition, an integral component of our synergy strategy for the Frutarom acquisition is focused on rationalizing the aggregate number of sites that the combined company operates. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and synergies from these activities may be affected by various factors and may pose significant risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe risk that we may be unable to successfully and efficiently manufacture the relocated product lines at a different manufacturing facility;\n\u2022\nthe risk that we may be unable to effectively reduce overhead and integrate and retain employees of the relocated operations;\n\u2022\nthe risk that we may face difficulties in implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;\n\u2022\nthe risk that we may face integrating newly acquired manufacturing, distribution and technology facilities;\n\u2022\npotential strains on our personnel, systems and resources and diversion of attention from other priorities; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen or contingent liabilities of the relocated operations.\nFurthermore, actual charges, costs and adjustments due to these activities may vary materially from our estimates, and these activities may require cash and non-cash integration and implementation costs or charges in excess of budgeted amounts, which could offset any such savings and other synergies and therefore could have an adverse effect on our margins.\nOur performance may be adversely impacted if we are not successful in managing our inventory and/or working capital balances.\nWe evaluate our inventory balances of materials based on shelf life, expected sourcing levels, known uses and anticipated demand based on forecasted customer order activity and changes in our product/sales mix. Efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success, financial returns and profitability. To be successful, we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate product/sales mix to meet our customers\u2019 demands, without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs associated with storing and holding other inventory adversely impact our financial results. If our buying decisions do not accurately predict sourcing levels, customer trends or our expectations about customer needs are inaccurate, we may have to take unanticipated markdowns or impairment charges to dispose of the excess or obsolete inventory, which can adversely impact our financial results. Additionally, we believe excess inventory levels of raw materials with a short shelf life in our manufacturing facilities subjects us to the risk of increased inventory shrinkage. If we are not successful in managing our inventory balances and shrinkage, our results of and cash flows from operations may be negatively affected.\nWe sell certain accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to unrelated financial institutions under \u201cfactoring\u201d agreements that are sponsored, solely and individually, by certain customers. The cost of participating in these programs was immaterial to our results in all periods. Should we choose not to participate, or if these programs were no longer available, it could reduce our cash flows from operations in the period in which the arrangement ends.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar U.S. or foreign anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nThe global nature of our business, the significance of our international revenue and our focus on emerging markets create various domestic and local regulatory challenges and subject us to risks associated with our international operations. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations in other countries generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or for other commercial advantage. In addition, U.S. public companies are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by directors, officers, employees,\nagents, or other strategic or local partners or representatives. As such, if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA or similar legislation, governmental authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere could seek to impose substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition.\nWe operate or may pursue opportunities in some jurisdictions, such as China, India, Brazil, Russia and Africa, which pose potentially elevated risks of fraud or corruption or increased risk of internal control issues. In certain jurisdictions, compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. From time to time, we have conducted and will conduct internal investigations of the relevant facts and circumstances, control testing and compliance reviews, and take remedial actions, when appropriate, to help ensure that we are in compliance with applicable corruption and similar laws and regulations. In addition, Frutarom grew through rapid acquisition and, as part of our integration efforts, we will be seeking to implement our anti-corruption and similar policies throughout a number of those acquired companies, many of which were not previously subject to these U.S. laws.\nDetecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations of the FCPA or similar laws is expensive and could consume significant time and attention of our senior management. We could be subject to inquiries or investigations by government and other regulatory bodies. Any allegations of non-compliance with the FCPA or similar laws could have a disruptive effect on our operations in such jurisdiction over the near term, including interruptions of business or loss of third-party relationships, which may negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition. Any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with the FCPA or similar laws could expose us to severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, significant fines, termination of necessary licenses and permits, and penalties or other sanctions that may harm our business and reputation.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on patents and trade secrets to protect our intellectual property rights. We often rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary fragrance and flavor formulations, as well as our extract methodologies, and processes for our nutraceutical, natural colors for food and natural antioxidants for food protection, as this does not require us to publicly file information regarding our intellectual property. From time to time, a third party may claim that we have infringed upon or misappropriated their intellectual property rights, or a third party may infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property rights. We could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions to assert our intellectual property rights against third parties or to defend ourselves from third party assertions of invalidity, infringement or misappropriation or other claims. Any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such litigation could require us to obtain a license to continue to use the intellectual property rights that are the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of such intellectual property rights. Any required licensing fees may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. For those intellectual property rights that are protected as trade secrets, this litigation could result in even higher costs, and potentially the loss of certain rights, since we would not have a perfected intellectual property right that precludes others from making, using or selling our products or processes. The ongoing trend among our customers towards more transparent labeling could further diminish our ability to effectively protect our proprietary flavor formulations.\nFor intellectual property rights that we seek to protect through patents, we cannot be certain that these rights, if obtained, will not later be opposed, invalidated, or circumvented. In addition, even if such rights are obtained in the US, the laws of some of the other countries in which our products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the US. If other parties were to infringe on our intellectual property rights, or if a third party successfully asserted that we had infringed on their intellectual property rights, it could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations by (i) reducing the price that we could obtain in the marketplace for products which are based on such rights, (ii) increasing the royalty or other fees that we may be required to pay in connection with such rights or (iii) limiting the volume, if any, of such products that we can sell.\nOur results of operations may be negatively impacted by the outcome of uncertainties related to litigation.\nFrom time to time we are involved in a number of legal claims, regulatory investigations and litigation, including claims related to intellectual property, product liability, environmental matters and indirect taxes. For instance, product liability claims may arise due to the fact that we supply flavors and fragrances to the food and beverage, functional food, pharma/nutraceutical and personal care industries. Our manufacturing and other facilities may expose us to environmental claims and regulatory investigations. In addition, as we expand our product offering into functional food, nutraceuticals, and natural antioxidants, we may also be subject to claims of false or deceptive advertising claims in the U.S., Europe and other foreign jurisdictions in which we offer these types of products. These claims can arise as a result of function claims, health claims, nutrient content claims and other claims that impermissibly suggest therapeutic benefits for certain foods or food\ncomponents. The cost of defending these claims or our obligations for direct damages and indemnification if we were found liable could adversely affect our profitability and our results of operations.\nAs a result of the acquisition of Frutarom, we assumed a number of legal claims, regulatory investigations and litigation and we may become involved in additional actions in the future arising from the acquired operations. Specifically, as Frutarom has a significantly greater number of facilities that are located globally and a significantly larger number of customers, our exposure to these type of environmental claims, product liability claims and regulatory investigations may increase. This could result in an increase in our cost for defense or settlement of claims or indemnification obligations if we were to be found liable in excess of our historical experience. Our insurance may not be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to pending and future claims and our current levels of insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable prices. Any of these factors, could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.\nOur funding obligations for our pension and postretirement plans could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.\nThe funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets, particularly the equity markets and interest rates. Funding obligations are determined under government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date. If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are expected under the governmental funding calculations, we could be required to make larger contributions. The equity markets can be very volatile, and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements. An adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our required contributions in the future and adversely impact our liquidity.\nAssumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are determined by us in consultation with outside consultants and advisors. In the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on assets, or expected health care costs, our future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease. Due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population, the assumptions that we use may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liabilities and related costs and funding requirements.\nAny future impairment of our tangible or intangible long-lived assets may adversely impact our profitability.\nA significant portion of our assets consists of long-lived assets, including tangible assets such as our manufacturing facilities, and intangible assets and goodwill. As a result of numerous recent acquisitions, including the 2018 acquisition of Frutarom, as of December 31, 2018, we had recorded approximately $8.4 billion of intangible assets and goodwill including goodwill and intangible assets related to our acquisitions. After the Frutarom acquisition was completed, for instance, we recorded a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated financial statements. Long-lived assets are subject to an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. For example, the amount of goodwill that we recorded from the Frutarom acquisition could be subject to impairment based upon future adverse changes in our business or prospects, including our inability to recognize the benefits anticipated by the transaction. Additionally, goodwill is subject to an impairment test at least annually. Indicators such as under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, changes in our strategy for its overall business or use of acquired assets, unexpected negative industry or economic trends, decreased market capitalization relative to net book values, unanticipated competitive activities, change in consumer demand, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired. To the extent any of our acquisitions do not perform as anticipated, whether due to internal or external factors, the value of such assets may be negatively affected and we may be required to record impairment charges. Our results of operations and financial position in future periods could be negatively impacted should future impairments of our long-lived assets, including intangible assets or goodwill occur.\nChanges in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or changes in existing tax laws could expose us to additional tax liabilities that may affect our future results.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in liabilities for uncertain tax positions, cost of repatriations or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nWe have and will continue to implement transfer pricing policies among our various operations located in different countries. These transfer pricing policies are a significant component of the management and compliance of our operations across international boundaries and overall financial results. Many countries routinely examine transfer pricing policies of\ntaxpayers subject to their jurisdiction, challenge transfer pricing policies aggressively where there is potential non-compliance and impose significant interest charges and penalties where non-compliance is determined. However, governmental authorities could challenge these policies more aggressively in the future and, if challenged, we may not prevail. We could suffer significant costs related to one or more challenges to our transfer pricing policies.\nWe are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and foreign tax authorities in those countries in which we operate, and we may be subject to assessments or audits in the future in any of the countries in which we operate. The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals, and while we do not believe the results that follow would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, such results could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made.\nIn addition, a number of international legislative and regulatory bodies have proposed legislation and begun investigations of the tax practices of multi-national companies and, in the European Union, the tax policies of certain European Union member states. One of these efforts has been led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international association of 34 countries including the U.S., which has finalized recommendations to revise corporate tax, transfer pricing, and tax treaty provisions in member countries. Since 2013, the European Commission (\u201cEC\u201d) has been investigating tax rulings granted by tax authorities in a number of European Union member states with respect to specific multi-national corporations to determine whether such rulings comply with European Union rules on state aid, as well as more recent investigations of the tax regimes of certain European Union member states. Under European Union law, selective tax advantages for particular taxpayers that are not sufficiently grounded in economic realities may constitute impermissible state aid. If the EC determines that a tax ruling or tax regime violates the state aid restrictions, the tax authorities of the affected European Union member state may be required to collect back taxes for the period of time covered by the ruling. In late 2015 and early 2016, the EC declared that tax rulings, related to other companies, by tax authorities in Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Belgium did not comply with the European Union state aid restrictions. If the EC were to successfully challenge tax rulings applicable to us in any of the member states in which we are subject to taxation, we could be exposed to increased tax liabilities.\nThe recently adopted U.S. tax legislation may result in additional tax liabilities that may affect our future results and profitability.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) that significantly revised the U.S. tax code effective January 1, 2018 by, among other things, lowering the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat 21%, limiting deductibility of interest expense and performance based incentive compensation, transitioning to a territorial system and creating new taxes associated with global operations. The Tax Act impacted our consolidated results of operations during 2018 and is expected to continue to impact our consolidated results of operations in future periods. In future periods, we expect that our effective tax rate will be impacted by the lower U.S. corporate tax rate that will initially be offset by the elimination of the deductibility of performance based incentive compensation, and other provisions of the Tax Act that may impact us prospectively. However, the ultimate impact of the Tax Act will depend on additional regulatory or accounting guidance that may be issued with respect to the Tax Act and any operating and structural changes that we may undertake to permit us to benefit from the new, lower U.S. tax rate prospectively. This could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe potential government regulation of certain of our product development initiatives is uncertain, and we may be subject to adverse consequences if we fail to comply with applicable regulations.\nAs part of our ingredients research program, we seek to enhance our collaboration with research institutions and companies throughout the world, including biotechnology companies. However, it is unclear whether any of our product developments will be classified as genetically modified food products subject to regulation as a biotechnology product. The manufacture of biotechnology products is subject to applicable Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations as prescribed by the Food and Drug Administration and the applicable standards prescribed by European Commission and the competent authorities of European Union Member States and to other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities. Compliance with these regulations can be expensive and time consuming. Such regulation could also subject us to requirements for labeling and traceability, which may cause our customers to avoid our affected products and seek our competitors\u2019 products. This may result in our inability to realize any benefit from our investment and have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur business may be negatively impacted as a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s expected departure from the European Union in 2019.\nWe currently manufacture goods in the United Kingdom for distribution in the European Union and vice-versa and therefore may be adversely affected as a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s expected departure from the European Union in 2019. The United Kingdom is expected to withdraw from the European Union in March 2019, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d. Negotiations are still underway to determine the terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union. The progress and outcomes of Brexit negotiations have, and may continue to, create global economic uncertainty, especially as customers and potential customers are unable to currently gauge the future regulations, and therefore costs, that will apply to their operations in the United Kingdom, and between the United Kingdom and the European Union. The withdrawal could, among other outcomes, exacerbate the disruption of the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union, undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas and significantly disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union or other nations as the United Kingdom pursues independent trade relations. In addition, Brexit has caused legal uncertainty, which could last indefinitely, and may potentially create divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate.\nThe effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the United Kingdom makes to retain access to European Union or other markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union would have and how such withdrawal would affect us. Adverse consequences concerning Brexit or the European Union could include deterioration in global economic conditions, instability in global financial markets, political uncertainty, volatility in currency exchange rates, or adverse changes in the cross-border agreements currently in place, any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results in the future.", "PERMNO": 40272, "SIC": 2860, "TIC": "IFF"}
