Risk Factors\nCOVID-19 Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has materially and adversely affected, and will likely continue to materially and adversely affect, the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.\nIn late 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 was identified in Wuhan, China. The COVID-19 outbreak has since spread and grown globally, including within the United States and, in March 2020, the President of the United States declared a national emergency. The COVID-19 pandemic has materially and adversely affected passenger demand and bookings for both business and leisure travel, thereby materially and adversely affecting operating income and cash flows from operations. The Company has bolstered its liquidity through the financings discussed in Notes 7, 8, and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, the Company has aggressively evaluated all capital spending, discretionary spending, and non-essential costs to identify opportunities for cost reductions or deferrals and significantly reduced annual 2020 cash outlays and spending, compared with original plans. The Company's cost reduction actions have included, among others, (i) cutting or deferring non-essential projects; (ii) reducing the Company's published flight schedule; (iii) placing a significant number of aircraft in storage; (iv) implementing voluntary separation and time-off programs for Employees; (v) substantially suspending all hiring; (vi) reducing the Chief Executive Officer's salary by 20 percent; (vii) reducing the other named executive officer salaries and Board of Director cash retainer fees by 20 percent through December 31, 2020; and (viii) where possible, modifying vendor and supplier payment terms.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s business and its financial and operational performance will depend on future developments, including (i) the duration, spread, severity, and any recurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic, including through any new variant strains of the underlying virus; (ii) the effectiveness and availability of vaccines; (iii) the duration and scope of related federal, state, and local government orders and restrictions; (iv) the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on overall demand for air travel; and (v) the Company\u2019s access to capital, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Continued reductions in the Company's flight schedule could have a significant negative effect on the Company's overall network and operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused public health officials to recommend precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, federal, state, and local authorities have at various times instituted measures such as imposing testing and self-quarantine requirements, issuing directives forcing businesses to reduce operations or temporarily close, restricting international air travel, and issuing shelter-in-place and similar orders limiting the movement of individuals. Additionally, businesses have restricted non-essential travel for their employees. Such measures have depressed demand for air travel, disrupted the Company\u2019s operations, and materially adversely affected the Company\u2019s business. The resulting cancellations of flights has resulted in a significant amount of cash refunds and the issuance of travel credits to Customers. The total value of refunds, excluding taxes and related fees, issued to Customers during March 2020, second quarter 2020, third quarter 2020, and fourth quarter 2020, was $248 million, $322 million, $162 million, and $202 million, respectively. The cancellations and cash refunds have negatively affected the Company's revenues and liquidity, and the Company expects such negative effects to continue. Further, due to the fears and restrictions involved with travel in the near term, sales of tickets for future travel have been adversely affected. The Company will continue to be materially adversely affected if government authorities extend existing orders or impose new orders or other restrictions intended to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, if businesses continue to restrict travel for their employees, or if fear of travel continues to depress future ticket sales.\nCertain Employees of the Company, and employees of its suppliers and service providers, including airport and air traffic personnel, have tested positive for or been suspected of having COVID-19. These cases have resulted in the closure of facilities, reduction in available staffing, and disruptions to the Company\u2019s overall operations. Additional instances of actual or perceived risk of infection among the Company\u2019s Employees, or its suppliers\u2019 or service providers\u2019 employees, could further negatively impact the Company\u2019s operations. The Company could also be materially adversely affected if it were unable to effectively maintain a suitably skilled and sized workforce, address employment-related matters, or maintain satisfactory relations with its Employees or its Employees\u2019 representatives.\nMoreover, the ability to attract and retain passengers depends, in part, upon the perception and reputation of the Company and the public\u2019s concerns regarding the health and safety of travel generally, especially regarding airline travel. Actual or perceived risk of infection on Company flights could have a material adverse effect on the public's comfort with air travel, which could harm the Company's reputation and business. The Company expects it will continue to incur COVID-19 related costs as it sanitizes airplanes and implements additional hygiene-related protocol to airplanes, and takes other action to limit infection among its Employees and passengers. In addition, the industry may be subject to enhanced health and hygiene requirements in attempts to counteract future outbreaks, which requirements may be costly and take a significant amount of time to implement.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s supply chain. For example, the Company is dependent on Boeing as its sole supplier for many of its aircraft parts. See other Risk Factors and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d below for further discussion of and risks related to the Company\u2019s relationship with Boeing. The Company is also dependent on (i) sole or limited suppliers for aircraft engines and certain other aircraft parts, equipment, and services; (ii) third party vendors; and (iii) service providers. The COVID-19 pandemic could result in delays and other performance issues, ceased operations, or even bankruptcies among these suppliers, third party vendors, and service providers. If a supplier, third party vendor, or service provider were unable to timely provide adequate products or support for its products, or otherwise fulfill its commitments to the Company, the Company\u2019s operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial markets may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s access to capital and cost of capital, including its ability to raise funds through equity or debt financings. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant disruption of global financial markets, which has negatively impacted the value of the Company\u2019s common stock and its debt ratings and could negatively affect the Company\u2019s liquidity. For example, as a result of the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, in the first half of 2020, Moody\u2019s, S&P Global, and Fitch downgraded the Company\u2019s senior unsecured debt ratings and issuer ratings. If the Company\u2019s credit ratings were to be further downgraded, or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to the Company\u2019s rating levels, the airline industry, or the Company, the Company\u2019s access to capital and the cost of\nany debt financing would be negatively affected. The Company continues to evaluate potential sources of additional liquidity in the short-term. The terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants or require incremental collateral, which could further restrict the Company\u2019s business operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak affects the Company\u2019s earnings and liquidity will depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to successfully access capital. There is no guarantee that debt or equity financings will be available in the future to fund the Company\u2019s obligations, or that they will be available on terms consistent with the Company\u2019s expectations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. The current outbreak and continued spread of COVID-19 could cause a global recession, which would have a further adverse impact on the Company\u2019s medium- and long-term financial condition and operations. Historically, unfavorable U.S. economic conditions have driven changes in travel patterns, including reduced spending for both leisure and business travel. Unfavorable economic conditions, when low fares are often used to stimulate traffic, have also historically hampered the ability of airlines to raise fares to counteract any increases in fuel, labor, and other costs. Any significant increases in unemployment in the United States would likely continue to have a negative impact on passenger bookings, and these effects could exist for an extensive period of time.\nRecent developments with respect to COVID-19 vaccines have the potential to affect the scope and duration of the pandemic. While a number of COVID-19 vaccines have received regulatory approval and are available in limited quantities in the United States and other parts of the world, a degree of uncertainty exists with respect to the distribution, utilization, and long-term efficacy of vaccinations among the general population. The impact of COVID-19 vaccines on the pandemic, demand for air travel, and the Company\u2019s business remain unknown. Even once the pandemic and fears of travel subside, demand for air travel may remain weak for a significant period of time. In particular, consumer behavior related to traveling may be negatively impacted by adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate, including higher unemployment rates, declines in income levels, and loss of wealth resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change.\nThe Company has entered into agreements with the U.S. Treasury with respect to funding support pursuant to the Payroll Support Program under the CARES Act and the Payroll Support Program Extension; pursuant to these agreements the Company has agreed to certain restrictions on how it operates its business and uses its cash, which could limit the ability of the Company to take actions that it otherwise might have determined were in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders.\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law. The CARES Act provides liquidity in the form of grants and loans to air carriers, such as the Company, that incurred, or are expected to incur, covered losses such that the continued operations of the business are jeopardized, as determined by the Treasury. In April 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with the Treasury with respect to funding support pursuant to the Payroll Support Program. In January 2021, the Company entered into an additional agreement with the Treasury with respect to the Payroll Support Program Extension. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company has agreed to certain restrictions on, and requirements with respect to, its business and operations, including the following:\n\u2022The Company is prohibited from repurchasing its common stock and from paying dividends or making capital contributions with respect to its common stock through March 31, 2022;\n\u2022The Company must place certain restrictions on certain higher-paid employee and executive pay, including limiting pay increases and severance pay or other benefits upon terminations, until October 1, 2022;\n\u2022The Company is prohibited from implementing involuntary terminations or furloughs of its Employees (except for death, disability, cause, or certain disciplinary reasons) through March 31, 2021;\n\u2022The Company may not reduce the salaries, wages, or benefits of its Employees (other than its Executive Officers, or as otherwise permitted under the terms of the Payroll Support Program) through March 31, 2021;\n\u2022Until March 1, 2022, the Company must comply with any requirement issued by the DOT that the Company maintain certain scheduled air transportation service as DOT deems necessary to ensure services to any point served by the Company before March 1, 2020; and\n\u2022The Company must maintain certain internal controls and records relating to the CARES Act funds, and is subject to additional reporting requirements.\nThese restrictions and requirements may necessitate that the Company take, or limit taking, actions it might otherwise believe to be in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders. For example, the restrictions could require that the Company change certain of its business practices, risk the Company's ability to retain key personnel, and expose the Company to additional costs (including increased compliance costs).\nBoeing 737-MAX Risks\nThe Company is currently dependent on Boeing as the sole manufacturer of the Company's aircraft. Prolonged delays completing the FAA\u2019s requirements to return the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft to Customer service, or further regulatory actions by the FAA with respect to the MAX aircraft, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business plans, strategies, and results of operations.\nThe Boeing 737 MAX aircraft are crucial to the Company\u2019s growth plans and fleet modernization initiatives. On November 18, 2020, the FAA rescinded its March 2019 Boeing 737 MAX grounding order, issued an airworthiness directive, and published training requirements enabling the Company to begin modifying certain operating procedures, implementing enhanced pilot training requirements, installing FAA-approved flight control software updates, and completing other required maintenance tasks specific to the MAX aircraft. See \"Business - Boeing 737 MAX Grounding\" above. In addition to training its active Pilots, the Company is continuing work on its 34 MAX aircraft delivered prior to the FAA\u2019s rescission of the grounding order to prepare each aircraft for the return to Customer service, including removing the aircraft from storage, installing the new flight control software updates, and performing required maintenance checks. The Company will also conduct multiple readiness flights on each of its MAX aircraft before each such aircraft is operated in Customer service.\nThe MAX groundings have adversely affected the Company's operations and financial results. While the Company has scheduled the MAX return to service on March 11, 2021, any prolonged delays completing the FAA\u2019s requirements to return the MAX aircraft to Customer service, or further regulatory actions by the FAA with respect to the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, could require additional flight schedule adjustments, result in delays of aircraft deliveries, and materially and adversely affect the Company's business plans, strategies, and results of operations.\nBoeing no longer manufactures versions of the 737 other than the 737 MAX family of aircraft. If the 737 MAX aircraft were to again become unavailable for the Company\u2019s flight operations, the Company\u2019s growth would be restricted unless and until it could procure and operate other types of aircraft from Boeing or another manufacturer, seller, or lessor, and the Company\u2019s operations would be materially adversely affected. In particular, if the Company\u2019s growth were to be dependent upon the introduction of a new aircraft make and model to the Company\u2019s fleet, the Company would need to, among other things, (i) develop and implement new maintenance, operating, and training programs; (ii) secure extensive regulatory approvals; and (iii) implement new technologies. The requirements associated with operating a new aircraft make and model could take an extended period of time to fulfill and would likely impose substantial costs on the Company. A shift away from a single fleet type could also add complexity to the Company\u2019s operations, present operational and compliance risks, and materially increase the Company's costs. Any of these events would have a material, adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results, and financial condition. The Company could also be materially adversely affected if the pricing or operational attributes of its aircraft were to become less competitive.\nFurther, even following the rescission of the FAA order to ground the MAX aircraft, the Company continues to be reliant on Boeing to provide necessary resources and support to return the MAX to Customer service. In addition, following the MAX return to Customer service, the Company could face significant operational challenges in\nefficiently taking delivery of a large number of MAX aircraft from Boeing and reintroducing the MAX aircraft into the Company's network in a controlled and steady manner.\nFinancial Risks\nThe airline industry is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions; in the event of continued unfavorable economic conditions or economic uncertainty, the Company's results of operations could be further negatively affected, which could require the Company to further adjust its business strategies.\nThe airline industry, which is subject to relatively high fixed costs and highly variable and unpredictable demand, is particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Historically, unfavorable U.S. economic conditions have driven changes in travel patterns and have resulted in reduced spending for both leisure and business travel. For some consumers, leisure travel is a discretionary expense, and short-haul travelers, in particular, have the option to replace air travel with surface travel. As has become particularly evident as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses and other travelers are able to forego air travel by using communication alternatives such as videoconferencing, business communication platforms, and the Internet. In addition, to the extent businesses continue to permit air travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, they are more likely to require the purchase of less expensive tickets to reduce costs. This, in turn, can result in a decrease in average revenue per seat. Also, as has become particularly evident as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, unfavorable economic conditions, when low fares are often used to stimulate traffic, hamper the ability of airlines to raise fares to counteract any increases in fuel, labor, and other costs. Any continuing or future U.S. or global economic uncertainty could further negatively affect the Company's results of operations and could cause the Company to further adjust its business strategies. Additionally, because expenses of a flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried, a relatively small change in the number of passengers can have a disproportionate effect on an airline\u2019s operating and financial results. Therefore, any continued reduction in airline passenger traffic could continue to adversely affect the Company's results of operations.\nThe Company's business can be significantly impacted by high and/or volatile fuel prices, and the Company's operations are subject to disruption in the event of any delayed supply of fuel; therefore, the Company's strategic plans and future profitability are likely to be impacted by the Company's ability to effectively address fuel price increases and fuel price volatility and availability.\nAirlines are inherently dependent upon energy to operate, and jet fuel and oil represented approximately 14.4 percent of the Company's operating expenses for 2020. As discussed above under \"Business - Cost Structure,\" although the airline industry experienced a relatively stable and moderate fuel environment in 2020, the cost of fuel can be extremely volatile and unpredictable, and even a small change in market fuel prices can significantly affect profitability. Furthermore, volatility in fuel prices can be due to many external factors that are beyond the Company's control. For example, fuel prices can be impacted by political, environmental, and economic factors, such as (i) dependency on foreign imports of crude oil and the potential for hostilities or other conflicts in oil producing areas; (ii) limitations and/or disruptions in domestic refining or pipeline capacity due to weather, natural disasters, or other factors; (iii) worldwide demand for fuel, particularly in developing countries, which can result in inflated energy prices; (iv) changes in U.S. governmental policies on fuel production, transportation, taxes, and marketing; and (v) changes in currency exchange rates.\nThe Company's ability to effectively mitigate the impact of fuel price increases could be limited by factors such as its historical low-fare reputation, the portion of its Customer base that purchases travel for leisure purposes, the competitive nature of the airline industry generally, and the risk that higher fares will drive a decrease in demand. The Company attempts to manage its risk associated with volatile jet fuel prices by utilizing over-the-counter fuel derivative instruments to hedge a portion of its future jet fuel purchases. However, energy prices can fluctuate significantly in a relatively short amount of time. Because the Company uses a variety of different derivative instruments at different price points, the Company is subject to the risk that the fuel derivatives it uses will not provide adequate protection against significant increases in fuel prices and in some cases could in fact result in\nhedging losses, which could result in the Company effectively paying higher than market prices for fuel, thus creating additional volatility in the Company's earnings.\nIn addition, the Company is subject to the risk that its fuel derivatives will no longer qualify for hedge accounting under applicable accounting standards, which can create additional earnings volatility. Adjustments in the Company's overall fuel hedging strategy, as well as the ability of the commodities used in fuel hedging to qualify for special hedge accounting, could continue to affect the Company's results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to cost-effectively hedge against increases in fuel prices.\nThe Company's fuel hedging arrangements and the various potential impacts of hedge accounting on the Company's financial position, cash flows, and results of operations are discussed in more detail under \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,\" and in Note 1 and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company is also reliant upon the readily available supply and timely delivery of jet fuel to the airports that it serves. A disruption in that supply could present significant challenges to the Company's operations and could ultimately cause the cancellation of flights and/or the inability of the Company to provide service to a particular airport.\nThe Company's low-cost structure has historically been one of its primary competitive advantages, and many factors have affected and could continue to affect the Company's ability to control its costs.\nThe Company's low-cost structure has historically been one of its primary competitive advantages, as it has enabled it to offer low fares, drive traffic volume, grow market share, and, prior to 2020, protect profits; however, as has been the case for the Company, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced the Company's competitors to implement significant cost reduction measures. Competitor cost reduction measures such as accelerated fleet retirements, capacity cuts, and headcount reductions, could have a negative impact on the Company's relative cost position.\nEven before the pandemic, the Company's low-cost position had been challenged by the significant growth of \"Ultra-Low Cost Carriers\" (\"ULCCs\"), which in some cases have surpassed the Company's cost advantage with larger aircraft, increased seat density, and lower wages. ULCCs have further introduced \"unbundled\" service offerings which appeal to price-sensitive travelers through promotion to consumers of an extremely low relative base fare for a seat, while separately charging for related services and products. In response, most major U.S. airlines began to offer expanded cabin segmentation fare products, such as \"basic economy\" and \"premium economy\" products. A basic economy product provides for a lower base fare to compete with a ULCC base fare, but may include significant additional restrictions on amenities such as seat assignments (including restrictions on group and family seating), order of boarding, checked baggage and use of overhead bin space, flight changes and refunds, and eligibility for upgrades. A \"premium economy\" fare targets consumers willing to pay a premium for certain amenities that were previously included in the carriers' base fare (e.g., more favorable seating locations in the main cabin). Also in response to competitive ULCC pricing, some carriers removed fare floors for certain routes, leading to a lower fare offering across the industry.\nThe Company's low-cost structure can also be negatively impacted by costs over which the Company has limited control. These include costs such as fuel, labor, airport, and regulatory compliance costs.\nJet fuel and oil constituted approximately 14.4 percent of the Company's operating expenses during 2020, and the Company's ability to control the cost of fuel is subject to the external factors discussed in the fifth Risk Factor above.\nSalaries, wages, and benefits constituted approximately 52.9 percent of the Company's operating expenses during 2020. The Company's ability to control labor costs is limited by the terms of its collective-bargaining agreements, and this limited control has negatively impacted the Company's low-cost position, in particular in the context of the Company's cost reduction efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic. As discussed further under \"Management\u2019s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" the Company's unionized workforce, which makes up approximately 83 percent of its Employees, has had pay scale increases as a result of contractual rate increases, which has put pressure on the Company's labor costs. Additionally, as indicated above under \"Business - Employees,\" the majority of Southwest's unionized Employee work groups, including its Pilots; Flight Attendants; Ramp, Operations, Provisioning, and Freight Agents; Customer Service Agents, Customer Representatives, and Source of Support Representatives; Aircraft Appearance Technicians; Dispatchers; and Meteorologists, are in unions currently in negotiations for labor agreements or have labor agreements that become amendable in 2021, which could result in additional pressure on the Company's low-cost structure.\nAs discussed above under \"Business - Regulation,\" the airline industry is heavily regulated, and the Company's regulatory compliance costs are subject to potentially significant increases from time to time based on actions by regulatory agencies that are out of the Company's control. Additionally, because of airport infrastructure updates and other factors, the Company has experienced increased space rental rates at various airports in its network. Further, the Company cannot control decisions by other airlines to reduce their capacity. When this occurs, certain fixed airport costs are allocated among a fewer number of total flights, which can result in increased landing fees and other costs for the Company.\nThe Company is reliant upon third party vendors and service providers, and the Company's low-cost advantage is dependent in part on its ability to obtain and maintain commercially reasonable terms with those parties. Disruptions to capital markets, shortages of skilled personnel, geopolitical developments, and/or adverse economic conditions could subject certain of the Company's third party vendors and service providers to significant financial pressures, which could lead to delays and other performance issues, ceased operations, or even bankruptcies among these third party vendors and service providers. If a third party vendor or service provider is unable to fulfill its commitments to the Company, the Company may be unable to replace that third party vendor or service provider in a short period of time, or at competitive terms, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.\nAs discussed above under \"Business - Insurance,\" the Company carries insurance of types customary in the airline industry. Although the Company has been able to purchase aviation, property, liability, and professional insurance via the commercial insurance marketplace, available commercial insurance could be more expensive in the future and/or have material differences in coverage than insurance that has historically been provided and may not be adequate to protect against the Company's risk of loss from future events, including acts of terrorism. Further, available cyber-security insurance with regards to data protection and business interruption could be more expensive in the future and/or have material differences in coverage than insurance that has historically been provided and may not be adequate to protect the Company's risk of loss. With respect to any insurance claims, policy coverages and claims are subject to acceptance by the many insurers involved and may require arbitration and/or mediation to effectively settle the claims over prolonged periods of time. In addition, an accident or other incident involving Southwest aircraft could result in costs in excess of its related insurance coverage, which costs could be substantial. Any aircraft accident or other incident, even if fully insured, could also have a material adverse effect on the public's perception of the Company, which could harm its reputation and business.\nAs discussed below under \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" the Company experienced significant unit cost pressure in 2019 following the MAX groundings and in 2020 following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Historically, except for changes in the price of fuel, changes in operating expenses for airlines have been largely driven by changes in capacity. However, the Company's operating expenses are largely fixed once flight schedules are published; and the Company experienced lower than expected capacity during 2019 due to the MAX groundings and, in particular, during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has made schedule adjustments and canceled flights based on consumer demand and booking trends. The continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to require the Company to make additional schedule adjustments and drive additional unit cost pressure.\nThe Company's results of operations could be adversely impacted if it is unable to effectively execute its strategic plans.\nThe Company is reliant on the success of its revenue strategies and other strategic plans and initiatives to grow and to help offset increasing costs. The execution of the Company's strategic plans has been significantly negatively affected by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Company cannot predict the duration or scope of continued impacts from the pandemic. Nevertheless, the Company has taken multiple actions to bolster its liquidity and better optimize its network in an effort to position itself to opportunistically recover and grow if and as the pandemic subsides. The timely and effective execution of the Company's strategies is dependent upon, among other factors, (i) the Company's ability to effectively balance its investment of incremental operating expenses and capital expenditures related to its strategies against the need to effectively control costs; (ii) the Company's ability to timely and effectively implement, transition, and maintain related information technology systems and infrastructure; (iii) as discussed below, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain satisfactory relations with its Employees or its Employees\u2019 representatives; and (iv) the Company's dependence on third parties with respect to the execution of its strategic plans.\nThe airline industry is intensely competitive.\nAs discussed in more detail above under \"Business - Competition,\" the airline industry is intensely competitive. The Company's primary competitors include other major domestic airlines, as well as regional and new entrant airlines, surface transportation, and alternatives to transportation such as videoconferencing, business communication platforms, and the Internet. The Company's revenues are sensitive to the actions of other carriers with respect to pricing, routes, loyalty programs, scheduling, capacity, customer service, operational reliability, comfort and amenities, cost structure, aircraft fleet, strategic alliances, and code-sharing and similar activities.\nInformation Technology Risks\nThe Company is increasingly dependent on technology to operate its business and continues to implement substantial changes to its information systems; any failure, disruption, breach, or delay in implementation of the Company's information systems could materially adversely affect its operations.\nThe Company is increasingly dependent on the use of complex technology and systems to run its ongoing operations and support its strategic objectives. These technologies and systems include, among others, the Company's website and reservation system; flight dispatch and tracking systems; flight simulators; check-in kiosks; aircraft maintenance, planning, and record keeping systems; telecommunications systems; flight planning and scheduling systems; crew scheduling systems; human resources systems; and financial planning, management, and accounting systems. The performance, reliability, and security of the Company's technology infrastructure and supporting systems are critical to the Company's operations and initiatives.\nImplementation and integration of complex systems and technology present significant challenges in terms of costs, human resources, and development of effective internal controls. Implementation and integration require a balancing between the introduction of new capabilities and the managing of existing systems, and present the risk of operational or security inadequacy or interruption, which could materially affect the Company's ability to effectively operate its business and/or could negatively impact the Company's results of operations.\nThe Company is also reliant upon the performance of its third party vendors for timely and effective implementation and support of many of its technology initiatives and for maintaining adequate information security measures within the services and/or software they deliver. If any of the Company's significant technologies or automated systems were to cease functioning, or if its third party vendor service providers were to fail to adequately and timely provide technical support, system maintenance, security, or software upgrades for any of the Company's existing systems, the Company could experience service interruptions, delays, and loss of critical data, which could harm its operations, and result in financial losses and reputational damage.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company's systems will continue to require modification and refinements to address growth and changing business requirements. In addition, the Company's systems may require modification to enable the Company to comply with changing regulatory requirements. Modifications and refinements to the\nCompany's systems have been and are expected to continue to be expensive to implement and can divert management\u2019s attention from other matters. In particular, during 2020, in connection with the Company's efforts to reduce capital and operating expenditures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company deferred a significant number of technology projects. In addition, the Company's operations could be adversely affected, or the Company could face imposition of regulatory penalties, if it were unable to timely or effectively modify its systems as necessary or appropriately balance the introduction of new capabilities with the management of existing systems.\nThe Company has experienced system interruptions and delays that have made its websites and operational systems unavailable or slow to respond, which has prevented the Company from efficiently processing Customer transactions or providing services. Any future system interruptions or delays could reduce the Company's operating revenues and the attractiveness of its services, as well as increase the Company's costs.\nThe Company's technologies and systems and functions could be damaged or interrupted by catastrophic events beyond its control such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes, power loss, computer and telecommunications failures, acts of war or terrorism, computer viruses, security breaches, and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruptions, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent the Company from processing Customer transactions or providing services, which could make the Company's business and services less attractive and subject the Company to liability. Any of these events could damage the Company's reputation and be expensive to remedy.\nDeveloping and expanding data security and privacy requirements could increase the Company's operating costs, and any failure of the Company to maintain the security of certain Customer, Employee, and business-related information could result in damage to the Company's reputation and could be costly to remediate.\nThe Company must receive information related to its Customers and Employees in order to run its business, and the Company's operations depend upon secure retention and the secure transmission of information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. This information is subject to the continually evolving risk of intrusion, tampering, and theft. Although the Company maintains systems to prevent or defend against these risks, these systems require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change, and security could be compromised, personal or confidential information could be misappropriated, or system disruptions could occur. In the ordinary course of its business, the Company also provides certain confidential, proprietary, and personal information to third parties. While the Company seeks to obtain assurances that these third parties will protect this information, there is a risk the security of data held by third parties could be breached. A compromise of the Company's security systems could adversely affect the Company's reputation and disrupt its operations and could also result in litigation against the Company or the imposition of penalties. In addition, it could be costly to remediate. Although the Company has not experienced cyber incidents that are individually, or in the aggregate, material, the Company has experienced cyber-attacks in the past, which have thus far been mitigated by preventative, detective, and responsive measures put in place by the Company.\nIn addition, in response to these types of threats, there has been heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data privacy and security in the United States and elsewhere. As a result, the Company must monitor a growing and fast-evolving set of legal requirements in this area. This regulatory environment is increasingly challenging and may present material obligations and risks to the Company's business, including significantly expanded compliance requirements, costs, and enforcement risks.\nThe Company has a dedicated cyber-security team and program that focuses on current and emerging data security matters. The Company continues to assess and invest in the growing needs of the cyber-security team through the allocation of skilled personnel, ongoing training, and support of the adoption and implementation of technologies coupled with cyber-security risk management frameworks.\nDuring the majority of 2020, and continuing into 2021, the Company has offered the ability to work remotely to most of the Company's office and clerical Employees, including the vast majority of its Employees at the Company's headquarters campus. Maintaining a remote work force significantly increases the risk of cyber incidents\nand events, such as computer viruses and security breaches, due to increased targeted attacks, which have thus far been mitigated by preventative, detective, and responsive measures put in place by the Company.\nThe Company carries a cyber-security insurance policy with regards to data protection and business interruption associated with both security breaches from malicious parties and from certain system failures. However, available cyber-security insurance with regards to data protection and business interruption could be more expensive in the future and/or have material differences in coverage than insurance that has historically been provided and may not be adequate to protect the Company's risk of loss.\nOperational Risks\nThe Company's business is labor intensive; therefore, the Company could be materially adversely affected in the event of conflict with its Employees or its Employees' representatives.\nThe airline business is labor intensive, and for the year ended December 31, 2020, Salaries, wages, and benefits expense represented approximately 52.9 percent of the Company's operating expenses. As discussed further under \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, to address the financial impacts of the COVID pandemic, the Company instituted voluntary separation and extended time off programs to mitigate costs. In addition, during 2020, the Company notified its non-unionized Employees of impending mandatory pay cuts, which have been avoided due to the Company\u2019s receipt of additional payroll support funds from Treasury under the Payroll Support Program Extension. The Company also sought equivalent wage and/or work rule concessions from its Employees represented for collective bargaining purposes by labor unions. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 83 percent of the Company's Employees were represented for collective bargaining purposes by labor unions, and because the Company was unable to obtain requested concessions from most of its unionized work groups, it sent furlough notices to the Employees in these work groups. These notices were also rescinded as a result of the Company\u2019s receipt of additional payroll support funds from Treasury under the Payroll Support Program Extension. Because of the percentage of its Employees represented for collective bargaining purposes by labor unions, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company was already particularly exposed in the event of labor-related job actions. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the Company\u2019s exposure and demonstrated the risk that the Company\u2019s results could be materially adversely affected in the event of conflicts with its Employees or its Employees\u2019 representatives.\nThe Company is currently dependent on a single engine supplier, as well as single suppliers of certain other aircraft parts and equipment; therefore, the Company could be materially adversely affected (i) if it were unable to obtain timely or sufficient delivery of aircraft parts or equipment from Boeing or other suppliers or adequate maintenance or other support from any of these suppliers, or (ii) in the event of a mechanical or regulatory issue associated with the Company's aircraft parts or equipment.\nThe Company is dependent on Boeing as its sole supplier for many of its aircraft parts. The Company is also dependent on sole or limited suppliers for aircraft engines and certain other aircraft parts, equipment, and services. If Boeing, or other suppliers, were unable or unwilling to timely provide adequate products or support for their products, or in the event of a mechanical or regulatory issue associated with engines or other parts, the Company's operations could be materially adversely affected. The Company could also be materially adversely affected if the pricing or operational attributes of its aircraft equipment were to become less competitive.\nThe airline industry has faced on-going security concerns and related cost burdens; further threatened or actual terrorist attacks, or other hostilities, even if not made directly on the airline industry, could significantly harm the airline industry and the Company's operations.\nTerrorist attacks or other crimes and hostilities, actual and threatened, have from time to time materially adversely affected the demand for air travel and also have necessitated increased safety and security measures and related costs for the Company and the airline industry generally. Safety and security measures can create delays and\ninconveniences, which in turn can reduce the Company's competitiveness against surface transportation for short-haul routes and alternatives to transportation such as videoconferencing, business communication platforms, and the Internet. Additional terrorist attacks or other hostilities, even if not made directly on the airline industry, or the fear of such attacks or other hostilities (including elevated national threat warnings, government travel warnings to certain destinations, travel restrictions, or selective cancellation or redirection of flights due to terror threats) would likely have a further significant negative impact on the Company and the airline industry.\nThe airline industry is affected by many conditions that are beyond its control, which can impact the Company's business strategies and results of operations.\nIn addition to the unpredictable economic conditions and fuel costs discussed above, the Company, like the airline industry in general, is affected by conditions that are largely unforeseeable and outside of its control, including, among others:\n\u2022adverse weather and natural disasters;\n\u2022changes in consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns, or demographic trends (including, without limitation, changes in travel patterns due to government shutdowns or sequestration);\n\u2022actual or potential disruptions in the air traffic control system (including, for example, as a result of inadequate FAA staffing levels due to government shutdowns or sequestration);\n\u2022actual or perceived delays at various airports resulting from government shutdowns (including, for example, longer wait-times at TSA checkpoints due to inadequate TSA staffing levels);\n\u2022changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation, industry bankruptcies, and other factors;\n\u2022delays in deliveries of new aircraft (including, without limitation, due to FAA groundings of certain aircraft types or due to the closure of the FAA's aircraft registry during government shutdowns);\n\u2022outbreaks of disease such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022actual or threatened war, terrorist attacks, government travel warnings to certain destinations, travel restrictions, and political instability.\nLegal, Regulatory, Compliance, and Reputational Risks\nThe Company is subject to extensive FAA regulation that may necessitate modifications to the Company\u2019s operations, business plans, and strategies.\nThe FAA promulgates and enforces regulations affecting the airline industry, and exercises extensive regulatory oversight of the Company\u2019s operations. The FAA from time to time also issues orders or directives relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft. FAA orders and directives can be issued with little or no notice, and in certain instances, require the temporary grounding of aircraft and/or the responsive investment of operational and financial resources. The issuance of new FAA regulations, regulatory amendments, or orders or directives could result in flight schedule adjustments and groundings or delays in aircraft deliveries, as well as lower operating revenues, operating income, and net income due to a variety of factors, including, among others, (i) lost revenue due to flight cancellations and disruptions as a result of a smaller operating aircraft fleet, (ii) the lack of ability to make corresponding reductions in expenses because of the fixed nature of many expenses, and (iii) possible negative effects on Customer confidence and airline choice. Government regulation affecting the Company is discussed in more detail in the below risk factor and above under \u201cBusiness - Regulation.\u201d\nAirport capacity constraints and air traffic control inefficiencies have limited and could continue to limit the Company's growth; changes in or additional governmental regulation could increase the Company's operating costs or otherwise limit the Company's ability to conduct business.\nAlmost all commercial service airports are owned and/or operated by units of local or state governments. Airlines are largely dependent on these governmental entities to provide adequate airport facilities and capacity at an affordable cost. In order to operate efficiently, as well as to add service in current and new markets, the Company must be able to maintain and/or obtain space and facilities at desirable airports with adequate infrastructure. Airport space, facility, and infrastructure constraints may prevent the Company from maintaining existing service and/or implementing new service in a commercially viable manner.\nSimilarly, the federal government singularly controls all U.S. airspace, and airlines are dependent on the FAA controlling that airspace in a safe and efficient manner. The current air traffic control system is mainly radar-based, supported in large part by antiquated equipment and technologies, and heavily dependent on skilled personnel. As a result, the air traffic control system may not be able to effectively keep pace with future air traffic growth. The FAA's protracted transition to modernized air traffic control systems and newer technologies could adversely impact airspace capacity and the overall efficiency of the system, resulting in limited opportunities for the Company to grow, longer scheduled flight times, increased delays and cancellations, and increased fuel consumption and aircraft emissions. The continuation of these air traffic control constraints or the FAA's inability to meet staffing needs on a long-term basis may have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations.\nAs discussed above under \"Business - Regulation,\" airlines are also subject to other extensive regulatory requirements. These requirements often impose substantial costs on airlines. The Company's strategic plans and results of operations could be negatively affected by changes in law and future actions taken by domestic and foreign governmental agencies having jurisdiction over its operations, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022increases in airport rates and charges;\n\u2022limitations on airport gate capacity or use of other airport facilities;\n\u2022limitations on route authorities;\n\u2022actions and decisions that create difficulties in obtaining access at slot-controlled airports;\n\u2022actions and decisions that create difficulties in obtaining operating permits and approvals;\n\u2022changes to environmental regulations;\n\u2022new or increased taxes or fees, including with respect to potential increases to the federal corporate income tax rate;\n\u2022changes to laws that affect the services that can be offered by airlines in particular markets and at particular airports;\n\u2022restrictions on competitive practices;\n\u2022changes in laws that increase costs for safety, security, compliance, or other Customer Service standards;\n\u2022changes in laws that may limit the Company's ability to enter into fuel derivative contracts to hedge against increases in fuel prices;\n\u2022changes in laws that may limit or regulate the Company's ability to promote the Company\u2019s business or fares;\n\u2022airspace closures or restrictions;\n\u2022grounding of commercial air traffic by the FAA; and\n\u2022the adoption of more restrictive locally-imposed noise regulations.\nThe Company is subject to various environmental requirements, including laws and regulations related to climate change and emissions. Compliance with new or existing environmental requirements could materially and adversely affect the Company's business plans, strategies, and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those relating to aircraft and ground-based emissions, discharges to water systems, safe drinking water, and the management of hazardous substances and waste materials. Certain legislative bodies and regulatory authorities are increasingly focused on climate change and have taken actions to implement additional\nlaws, regulations, and programs intended to protect the environment. For example, as discussed in more detail under \u201cBusiness - Regulation,\u201d the federal government, as well as several state and local governments, the governments of other countries, and the United Nations\u2019 International Civil Aviation Organization have implemented legislative and regulatory proposals and voluntary measures intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Compliance with laws, regulations, and other programs intended to reduce emissions or otherwise protect the environment may require the Company to modify its supply chain practices, secure carbon offset credits or otherwise pay for emissions, or make capital investments to modify certain aspects of its operations. Future policy, legal, and regulatory developments relating to the protection of the environment could increase the Company\u2019s costs and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s plans and operations.\nThe Company's future results will suffer if it is unable to effectively manage its expanded international operations and/or Extended Operations (\"ETOPS\").\nThe Company's international flight offerings are subject to CBP-mandated procedures, which can affect the Company's operations, costs, and Customer experience. The Company has made significant investments in facilities, equipment, and technologies at certain airports in order to improve the Customer experience and to assist CBP with its inspection and processing duties; however, the Company is not able to predict the impact, if any, that various CBP measures or the lack of CBP resources will have on Company revenues and costs, either in the short-term or the long-term.\nInternational flying requires the Company to modify certain processes, as the airport environment is dramatically different in certain international locations with respect to, among other things, common-use ticket counters and gate areas, passenger entry requirements (including health requirements imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic), local operating requirements, and cultural preferences. Certain international routes served by the Company are also subject to specific aircraft equipage requirements and unique consumer behavior. Route-specific equipage requirements and unique consumer behavior, together or individually, may (i) restrict the Company's flexibility when scheduling and routing aircraft and crews; (ii) require the Company to modify its policies or procedures; and (iii) impact the Company's operational performance, costs, and Customer Experience. In addition, international flying exposes the Company to certain foreign currency risks to the extent the Company chooses to, or is required to, transact in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To the extent the Company seeks to serve additional international destinations in the future, or to renew its authority to serve certain routes, it may be required to obtain necessary authority from the DOT and/or approvals from the FAA, as well as any applicable foreign government entity.\nThe Company's operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions may subject the Company to the laws of those jurisdictions rather than, or in addition to, U.S. laws. Laws in some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the United States, and these differences can affect the Company's ability to react to changes in its business, and its rights or ability to enforce rights may be different than would be expected under U.S. laws. Furthermore, enforcement of laws in some jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which can affect both the Company's ability to enforce its rights and to undertake activities that it believes are beneficial to its business. As a result, the Company's ability to generate revenue and its expenses in non-U.S. jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if U.S. laws governed these operations. Although the Company has policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote compliance with the laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates, a violation by the Company's Employees, contractors, or agents or other intermediaries could nonetheless occur. Any violation (or alleged or perceived violation), even if prohibited by the Company's policies, could have an adverse effect on the Company's reputation and/or its results of operations.\nIn 2019, the Company began service to Hawaii after receiving approval from the FAA for ETOPS, a regulatory requirement to operate between the U.S. mainland and the Hawaiian Islands. The Company is subject to additional, ongoing, ETOPS-specific regulatory and procedural requirements, which present operational and compliance risks to the Company\u2019s business, including costs associated therewith.\nThe Company is currently subject to pending litigation, and if judgment were to be rendered against the Company in the litigation, such judgment could adversely affect the Company's operating results.\nAs discussed below under \"Legal Proceedings,\" the Company is subject to pending litigation.\nRegardless of merit, these litigation matters and any potential future claims against the Company may be both time consuming and disruptive to the Company's operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention. Should the Company fail to prevail in these or other matters, the Company may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could materially adversely affect its business and might materially affect its financial condition and operating results and could cause reputational harm.\nThe Company\u2019s reputation and brand could be harmed if it were to experience significant negative publicity, including through social media.\nThe Company operates in a public-facing industry with significant exposure to social media. Negative publicity, whether or not justified, can spread rapidly through social media. To the extent that the Company is unable to respond timely and appropriately to negative publicity, the Company\u2019s reputation and brand can be harmed. Damage to the Company\u2019s overall reputation and brand could have a negative impact on its financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s Bylaws provide, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, that the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas or, if such court lacks jurisdiction, the state district court of Dallas County, Texas, will be the exclusive forum for certain legal actions between the Company and its Shareholders, which could increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims, or limit the ability of the Company\u2019s Shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum viewed by the Shareholders as more favorable for disputes with the Company or the Company\u2019s directors, officers, or other Employees.\nThe Company\u2019s Bylaws provide, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas or, if such court lacks jurisdiction, the state district court of Dallas County, Texas, will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company; (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, or other Employee of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s Shareholders; (c) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director, officer, or other Employee of the Company pursuant to any provision of the Company\u2019s Restated Certificate of Formation or Bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time) or the Texas Business Organizations Code; and (d) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director, officer, or other Employee of the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThe forum selection provision may increase costs to bring a claim, discourage claims, or limit a Shareholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such Shareholder finds favorable for disputes with the Company or the Company\u2019s directors, officers, or other Employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company or the Company\u2019s directors, officers, and other Employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the forum selection provision contained in the Company\u2019s Bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, the Company could incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions. The exclusive forum provision in the Bylaws will not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for actions brought under the federal securities laws including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the Securities Act of 1933, or the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.", "PERMNO": 58683, "SIC": 4512, "TIC": "LUV"}
