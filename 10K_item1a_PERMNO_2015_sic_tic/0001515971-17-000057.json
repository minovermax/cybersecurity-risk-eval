The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related To Our Company Generally\nWe have incurred, and may continue to incur, losses. We have incurred net losses for most fiscal periods since our inception. From inception through December 31, 2016, we have generated $97,228,090 in revenues and an accumulated deficit (including preferred stock dividends and returns) in the amount of $121,942,132. The negative cash flow we have sustained has materially reduced our working capital, which in turn could materially and negatively impact our ability to fund future operations and continue to operate as a going concern. Management has taken and continues to take actions to improve our results. The availability of necessary working capital, however, is subject to many factors beyond our control, including our ability to obtain favorable financing, economic cycles, market acceptance of our products, competitors' responses to our products, the intensity of competition in our markets, and the level of demand for our products.\nWe may need additional financing to continue operations. Because we may continue to experience negative cash flow, we may need to obtain additional financing to continue operations. Management will continue to plan and take actions to improve our financial results which could enhance our ability to obtain debt financing. However, obtaining additional financing is subject to many factors beyond our control and may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. We are subject to potential material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. The materials used in our operations subject us to risks of environmental contamination that subject us to liability, including remediation obligations that could be very costly. In addition, the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We have a Surety Bond in place supported by funds in a restricted cash account to provide the financial assurance required by the NRC for our Idaho facility license for decommissioning and a similar mechanism will be required to fund the decommissioning of the proposed new depleted uranium facility. However, if a contamination event occurred within, or outside of, our facility we would be financially responsible to remediate such contamination and could have to borrow money or fund the remediation liability from our future revenue. We may not be able to borrow the funds, or have available revenue, sufficient to meet this potential liability, which could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon key personnel. Our ongoing operations are dependent on Steve T. Laflin, President and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of Mr. Laflin could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have a $2 million key man life insurance policy on Mr. Laflin and an employment agreement that extends through February 28, 2022. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to retain Mr. Laflin or our existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees. The loss of any of our key personnel or an inability to attract additional qualified employees could result in a significant decline in revenue.\nGeneral economic conditions in markets in which we do business can impact the demand for our goods and services. Decreased demand for our products and services can have a negative impact on our financial performance and cash flow. Demand for our products and services, in part, depends on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and industries in which we do business. A downturn in economic conditions in the U.S. or industry that we serve may negatively impact demand for our products and services, in turn negatively impacting our operations and financial results. Further, changes in demand for our products and services can magnify the impact of economic cycles on our businesses. For instance, our topaz gemstone processing is affected by the demand for luxury items such as jewelry as well as by the instability of foreign markets which are key factors in the manufacture of products using irradiated gemstones.\nVolatility in raw material and energy costs, interruption in ordinary sources of supply and an inability to recover unanticipated increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or significantly increase the cost of doing business. Market and economic conditions affecting the costs of raw materials, utilities, energy costs, and infrastructure required for the delivery of our goods and services are beyond our control and any disruption or halt in supplies, or rapid escalations in costs could affect our ability to manufacture products or to competitively price our products in the marketplace. For instance, an interruption in the supply of isotopes such as cobalt-57, cobalt-60, or iodine-131 could result in lost sales of nuclear medicine and calibration standards sales, cobalt product sales and radiochemical products.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation in jurisdictions around the globe in which we do business. Regulations address, among other things, environmental compliance, import/export restrictions, healthcare services, taxes and financial reporting, and can significantly increase the cost of doing business, which in turn can negatively impact our operations, financial results and cash flow. We are subject to government regulation and intervention both in the United States and in all foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and operating costs and changes to current regulations with which we must comply can necessitate further capital expenditures and increases in operating costs to enable continued compliance. Additionally, from time to time, we may be involved in legal or administrative proceedings under certain of these laws and regulations. Significant areas of regulation and intervention include the following:\nRadioactive Waste. All of our manufacturing processes generate some radioactive waste. For waste that cannot be decayed in storage we must handle this waste pursuant to the Low Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act, which requires the safe disposal of mildly radioactive materials. The estimated costs for storage and disposal of these materials have been included in the manufacturing and sales price of our products. However, actual disposal costs are subject to change at the discretion of the disposal site and are ultimately applied at the time of disposal. The NRC is revising its regulations on the disposal of depleted uranium waste at LLRW disposal facilities that accept substantial quantities of depleted uranium. If commercial LLRW disposal facilities are not readily available to us, we may not be able to provide the de-conversion services at the level assumed by our business model.\nHealth Compliance. Health regulations, dictated by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration and NRC are extensive in our business. There is no assurance that our activities will not at times result in liability under health regulations. Costs and expenses resulting from such liability may materially negatively impact our operations and financial condition. Overall, health laws and regulations will continue to affect our business worldwide.\nNRC License Enforcement Actions. The NRC may take enforcement action in the event that the Company is found to be in violation of NRC regulations or in violation of any of our license requirements. Consequences of violations depend upon the severity of the violations as well as the adequacy and timeliness of corrective actions implemented by the licensee to investigate and correct the cause of the violation and to prevent reoccurrence. The NRC has discretionary authority in the action they choose to take against license violations but these actions can include civil penalties and restrictions upon licensee operations or license suspension.\nEnvironmental Regulation. We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and state statutes such as the Idaho Hazardous Waste Management Act, the Low Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act, NRC regulations concerning various irradiated, radioactive, and depleted uranium materials, and United States Department of Transportation regulations concerning shipment of radioactive materials. Certain of these laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques, could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nImport/Export Regulation. We are subject to significant regulatory oversight of our import and export operations due to the nature of our product offerings. Penalties for non-compliance can be significant and violations can result in adverse publicity. We also have an NRC license for the export of radioactive materials. Because of increasing security controls and regulations, it is likely that we may encounter additional regulations affecting transportation, storage, sale, and import/export of radioactive materials.\nTaxes. We structure our operations to be tax efficient and to make use of tax credits and other incentives. Nevertheless, changes in tax laws, actual results of operations, final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities, and the timing and rate at which tax credits can be utilized can change the rate at which we are taxed, thereby affecting our financial results and cash flow.\nFinancial Accounting Standards. Our financial results can be impacted by new or modified financial accounting standards.\nWe may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability claims that may be brought against us. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that products supplied by us fail to perform as expected or such failures result, or are alleged to result, in bodily injury. Although we have purchased insurance with coverage and in amounts that we believe to be adequate and reasonable in light of our current and planned operations, including our planned uranium de-conversion and fluoride gas production business, if a successful product liability claim were brought against us in excess of our available insurance coverage or established reserves, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nOur earnings, cash flow and financial position are exposed to financial market risks worldwide, including interest rates. Fluctuations in domestic and world markets could adversely affect interest rates and impact our ability to obtain credit or attract investors. Such market risk could have a negative impact on future business opportunities including our ability to raise additional capital for planned business expansion. We also purchase some of our radiochemical products from overseas suppliers and the price of those products could be adversely affected through changes in currency exchange rates.\nCatastrophic events such as natural disasters, pandemics, war and acts of terrorism could disrupt our business or the business of our suppliers or customers, and any such disruptions could have a negative impact on our operations, financial results and cash flow. Our operations are at all times subject to the occurrence of catastrophic events outside our control, ranging from severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and storms, to health epidemics and pandemics, to acts of war and terrorism. Any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect our ability to produce and distribute our products and possibly expose us to third-party liability claims. Additionally, such events could impact our suppliers, thereby causing energy and raw materials to become unavailable to us, and our customers, who may be unable to purchase or accept our products and services. Any such occurrence could have a negative impact on our operations and financial condition.\nOur future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and products that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins. Our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards. Accordingly, our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop and maintain competitive products, (iii) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors, and (iv) develop, manufacture, and bring products to market quickly and cost-effectively. Our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation or U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources. These development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and they may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. In addition, the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we currently anticipate. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects.\nRisks Related To Our Current Business Operations\nWe are dependent on various third parties in connection with our business operations. The production of high-specific activity cobalt is dependent upon the DOE, and its prime-operating contractor, which controls the Idaho reactor. Current activity at the Idaho ATR may continue to affect the supply of cobalt material needed for the manufacture of cobalt sources. Loss of the ability to use, or cost-effectively use, these irradiation services would significantly impact our cobalt products business segment because there is not currently another reactor available in the United States that is capable of providing this type of service for us. Our nuclear medicine calibration and reference standard manufacturing is conducted under an exclusive contract with RadQual, which in turn has agreements in place with several distributors for marketing and sales. Our radiochemical iodine is supplied to us through two supply sources with a third source expected to become available during 2017. Unanticipated contract terminations by any of these suppliers and other third parties would have a material adverse impact on our operations, financial results, and cash flow.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of customers in connection with our current business operations. During 2015 and 2016, sales to RadQual represented 31% and 28%, respectively, of our total gross revenues. Combined sales to our three top customers accounted for 43% of our total gross revenues during 2016, and combined sales to our top three customers accounted for 40% of gross revenue in 2015. Although we are making efforts to reduce our dependency on a small number of customers, the loss of any one of these customers could have a significant impact on our future results of operations and financial condition. Unanticipated contract terminations by any of these current customers could have a material adverse impact on operations, financial results, and cash flow.\nWe are subject to competition from other companies. Each of our existing business areas has direct competition from other businesses. High-specific activity cobalt is supplied by other reactor facilities around the world. Nuclear medicine calibration and reference standards are being produced by one other major manufacturer in the United States. Most of our radiochemicals are also manufactured by several other companies in the world, and there are other providers of radiological field services. Most of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources that could give them a competitive advantage over us.\nRisks Related To Our Common Stock\nTrading in our common stock is limited and the price of our common stock may be subject to substantial volatility. Our common stock has historically been quoted on the Over The Counter Bulletin Board\u00ae (\u201cOTCBB\u201d) under the ticker symbol \u201cINIS.OB.\u201d In February 2015, we transferred the listing of our common stock to the OTCQB Marketplace under the U.S. trading symbol \u201cINIS\u201d. The market for our securities is limited, the price of our stock is volatile, and the risk to investors in our common stock is greater than the risk associated with stock trading on other markets. These factors may reduce the potential market for our common stock by reducing the number of potential investors. This may make it more difficult for investors in our common stock to sell shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of their shares. This could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock. We do not plan to pay dividends on shares of our common stock in the near future. Consequently, an investor in our common stock can only achieve a return on its investment in us if the market price of our common stock appreciates.\nWe are contractually obligated to issue shares in the future, which will dilute your interest in us. As of December 31, 2016, there were approximately 23,316,667 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of vested stock options outstanding, at a weighted-average exercise price of $.05 per share. An additional 24,363,178 shares were reserved for issuance under our equity plans as of December 31, 2016. Our outstanding preferred stock and certain of our outstanding debt is also convertible into shares of our common stock at the holders\u2019 option. In addition, we expect to issue additional options to purchase shares of our common stock to compensate employees, consultants and directors, and we may issue additional shares to raise capital to expand our manufacturing capability, develop additional products, or fund our planned uranium de-conversion plant. Any such issuances will have the effect of further diluting the interest of the holders of our securities. Also, outstanding as of December 31, 2016, were Series K Warrants for the issuance of 2,419,172 shares of common stock, and Series L Warrants for the issuance of 25,000,000 shares of common stock. The weighted average exercise price for all outstanding warrants as of December 31, 2016 was $0.08 per share.\nRisks Related to Our Proposed De-Conversion and FEP Produced Fluoride Gas Business\nWe will need to raise additional funds to complete the construction of our de-conversion and FEP facility. We need to secure more customer contracts and raise approximately $125 million in additional funds to complete the design and construction of a de-conversion facility with a production-scale FEP operation. We may not be able to raise the additional capital required to complete the facility on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, the total funds required to complete this project have been based upon early preliminary estimates and, while we believe these estimates are conservative, there can be no assurance that unforeseen expenses will not be incurred and additional funding will not be required to complete the project.\nWe do not have an operating history with respect to our strategy to combine de-conversion services and FEP-produced fluoride gas products and this business may not succeed. We have no operating results with respect to providing de-conversion services or producing high volumes of fluoride gas products using FEP to date and, therefore, we do not have an operating history upon which you can evaluate this business or our prospects. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks and uncertainties encountered in entering a new line of business.\nSome of these risks relate to our potential inability to:\n\u2022 construct our planned de-conversion and FEP production plant, including the effective management of the cost of the design and construction of the facility, and obtain the additional financing necessary for such construction;\n\u2022 maintain the necessary regulatory approvals for the facility and the ongoing operations of the facility;\n\u2022 obtain the groundwater permit from the state of New Mexico;\n\u2022 produce commercially economic volumes of high-purity fluoride products using FEP;\n\u2022 effectively manage this new business and its operations;\n\u2022 successfully establish and maintain our intended low-cost structure; and\n\u2022 successfully address the other risks described throughout this Annual Report.\nIf we cannot successfully manage these risks, our business and results of operations and financial condition will suffer.\nThe market for our de-conversion services may be adversely affected if planned enrichment facilities that would create by-products suitable for our de-conversion services are not completed. When funding becomes available to us, we intend to build a de-conversion and FEP production plant, in part, to process the anticipated DUF6 by-product from the URENCO USA (UUSA) enrichment plant in New Mexico or from the DOE depleted uranium stockpiles in either Portsmouth, OH or Paducah, KY. There had been several other enrichment facilities planned by companies, including USEC, AREVA, and GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy's Global Laser Enrichment. However, all of those plans have been delayed and may never be constructed. We currently have a de-conversion service agreement in place with UUSA, however, all of our performance milestone dates have passed. When and if the Company resumes work on the construction of the facility we will seek to renegotiate the milestone dates in the agreement with UUSA. If none of the other anticipated enrichment facilities are completed or if UUSA decides not to process their depleted uranium stockpile we may not have sufficient demand for our de-conversion services to realize the expected economic benefit from building this facility.\nWe currently have only one contract to provide de-conversion services to an enrichment firm. We currently have only one de-conversion services agreement with UUSA but that agreement is effectively expired since all of the contract milestone dates have passed. The initial term of the agreement was to extend for a period sufficient to cover the first five years of de-conversion services once our planned uranium de-conversion facility is operational, based on operations that were to have started no later than January 1, 2014. UUSA has indicated they are willing to discuss possible modification of the agreement commitment dates once we establish firm dates for start of construction. If we cannot demonstrate certain production capacities in accordance with the agreement, UUSA has the option to terminate the agreement and we would have no opportunity to cure pursuant to the terms of the agreement.\nThere is no history of large-scale commercial fluoride gas production utilizing FEP. We have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using FEP to produce some fluoride gases and Starmet Corporation (\u201cStarmet\u201d), which originally developed and patented the technology, also used FEP to produce a fluoride gas. However, FEP has not been used for large-scale commercial production of the size and magnitude envisioned in conjunction with the de-conversion process and there may be technical issues and process challenges related to the utilization of FEP for large-scale commercial production. Unforeseen issues associated with constructing and scaling up these new FEP operations could significantly impact our proposed schedule and our overall ability to produce high-purity fluoride gas in the quantities anticipated.\nPrior to the start of operations of the facility, we must obtain a Ground Water Permit from the State of New Mexico, and we cannot guarantee the amount of time required to obtain this permit from the State of New Mexico for operation of these facilities. The operation of the planned depleted uranium de-conversion facility requires a ground water permit from the State of New Mexico. There is no assurance that the ground water permit will be issued to us by the State of New Mexico. We also have no control over the actual time required by the State of New Mexico to review and approve the application for the ground water permit. Failure to obtain the permit, or any delay in obtaining the permit, could delay the start of operations of our planned depleted uranium de-conversion facility, thereby delaying revenue-generating operations at the facility.\nThe DOE is obligated to take depleted uranium from enrichment companies. The DOE has constructed two depleted uranium de-conversion facilities. These facilities are obligated to process depleted uranium produced from United States commercial uranium enrichment facilities at a price determined by DOE. We believe our depleted uranium processing facility will offer the better value to enrichment companies but we cannot assure you that enrichment companies will not select the DOE as their de-conversion service provider. If UUSA terminates our agreement and other enrichment companies do not resume their enrichment facility construction plans, we may not be able to realize the expected economic benefit from our planned de-conversion and FEP production plant.\nWe may be handling large quantities of DUF6 and fluoride gases, which are radioactive and hazardous materials, respectively, and are subject to intense regulation. The hazardous nature of DUF6 and fluoride gases affects the actions we are required to take for licensing, air permitting, environmental review, emergency response, liability insurance, personnel training, and generally increases the level of concern by the general public with respect to our handling of these materials. All of these factors complicate the licensing and operations processes and involve a host of additional regulatory factors that could affect the timeline for completing our de-conversion and FEP facility. Additionally, the NRC is revising its regulations on the disposal of depleted uranium waste at Low Level Radioactive Waste (\u201cLLRW\u201d) disposal facilities that accept large quantities of depleted uranium. Any changes to the current regulations may result in increased disposal costs that we intend to pass through to our customers, which, depending on the significance of the increased cost, may cause potential customers to continue to store their DUF 6 rather than pay for de-conversion and disposal services.\nWe will be subject to competition from the DOE and other companies. While there are no currently operating commercial DUF6 de-conversion facilities in the United States, the DOE is operating two de-conversion plants intended to process DUF6 from the DOE\u2019s existing 1.5 billion-pound stockpile. Additionally, AREVA currently operates a de-conversion plant in France, UUSA is constructing a facility in the U.K., and the State Atomic Energy Corporation ROSATOM has constructed a facility in Russia. We cannot assure you that the operators of the existing DUF 6 de-conversion facilities will not build additional facilities to expand their operations and compete with us in providing de-conversion services or that commercial enrichment companies will not choose to ship their depleted DUF 6 overseas for processing in France, the U.K., or Russia.\nWe currently hold conditional title to the property in Lea County, New Mexico where the proposed plant is to be constructed. The property location for our planned facility is located in Lea County, New Mexico. Lea County, New Mexico has transferred the property to us under the provisions of the New Mexico Local Economic Development Act, Project Participation Agreement. Under the original agreement, we were obligated to meet certain performance objectives; namely starting Phase I construction no later than December 31, 2014, completing Phase I and hiring at least 75 employees by December 31, 2015, in order to retain title to the property. We did not meet either of those deadlines. However, in July 2015, we executed an amendment to the PPA that extended the due date of the Phase I construction to December 31, 2016, and Phase I completion and hiring at least 75 employees to December 31, 2017. We did not meet the December 31, 2016 deadline and we are working with Lea County to\nexecute an additional modification to the agreement to further extend these dates to at least 2020. If we do not succeed in extending the commitment dates or in reaching performance dates set forth in a modified agreement then we may, at our sole option, either purchase or re-convey the property to Lea County, New Mexico. In addition, if Lea County does not agree to that modification and we do not retain title to the property, it could have a material adverse impact on our planned de-conversion and FEP project since another location would need to be selected and evaluated for environmental compliance.\nOur business may be harmed if we fail to protect our proprietary FEP technology utilized in our planned de-conversion and FEP production facility. We rely on patents to protect our intellectual property rights to the FEP technology to be used in our planned de-conversion and FEP production plant. Although we have filed international Patent Cooperation Treaty (\u201cPCT\u201d) applications to seek international protection for the FEP process in certain countries, we cannot be certain that our competitors will not be able to design around our patents and that the laws of some countries in which our FEP patents are or may be practiced will protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States, increasing the possibility of piracy of our patents. Although we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our FEP technology. Our competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology.", "PERMNO": 85296, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "INIS"}
