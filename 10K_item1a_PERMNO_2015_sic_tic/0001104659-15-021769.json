RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Financial Condition\nOur financial performance is currently dependent on a single product, and disruptions in our ability to sell this product may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur current revenue and profitability is dependent on the sale of the MRidium 3860+ and 3850/R MRI compatible IV infusion pump system and the ongoing sale of disposable tubing sets related to them. Sales of the MRidium 3860+ and 3850/R MRI compatible IV infusion pump systems have historically comprised a substantial majority of our net revenue. Our near-term revenue and profitability will, accordingly, be dependent upon our ability to successfully market and sell this Class II medical device.\nOn September 2, 2014 we announced we received a Warning Letter from the FDA. The FDA stated in the Warning Letter that modifications made to software on our previously cleared infusion pumps, the MRidium 3860 and MRidium 3850, were \u201csignificant\u201d and required submission of new premarket notifications under Section 510(k) (a \u201c510(k) submission\u201d) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the \u201cFDCA\u201d). Such updates occurred periodically over time. As stated in the warning letter, the FDA indicated that the modifications of the software related to the MRidium 3860 from version 2.0 to current version 3.5.1 and the modifications of the software related to the MRidium 3850 from version 1.0 to version 585.11.1 as \u201csignificant\u201d modifications because they could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the devices. As a result, the Warning Letter alleges that the products being sold by us are \u201cadulterated\u201d and \u201cmisbranded\u201d under the FDCA. The Warning Letter also indicates that the MRidium 3860+ infusion pump requires separate FDA clearance from the MRidium 3860 and MRidium 3850.\nThe Warning Letter requested that we immediately cease activities that result in the misbranding or adulteration of the MRidium 3860 MRI infusion pump, MRidium 3850 MRI infusion pump, and the MRidium 3860+ MRI infusion pump, such as the commercial distribution of the devices. We immediately complied with the Warning Letter and ceased sale and distribution of the identified products in the United States. On November 25, 2014, we announced that we filed the 510(k) submission related to our MRidium 3860+ MRI IV infusion pumps and on December 12, 2014 we were notified that our 510(k) submission had been formally accepted for review by the FDA. On December 22, 2014, we announced that we resumed domestic distribution of our MRI compatible MRidium 3860+ MRI IV infusion pump systems, without the Dose Error Reduction System (\u201cDERS\u201d) option. On January 28, 2015, subsequent to our year end, we announced that we resumed domestic distribution of our DERS option.\nThe disruption in the shipment of our products had a significant adverse effect on our business and our financial condition. We are working with the FDA to resolve this issue and resume commercial distribution of our product. On September 4, 2014, we submitted to the FDA our initial response to the Warning Letter and on September 17, 2014 we sent an additional response that included supplemental information. Although we have resumed commercial distribution of our product, there can be no guarantee that our efforts will be successful in obtaining clearance of our 510(k) submission. The FDA could require us to, again, cease shipment of our products, or notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risk or substantial harm to public health, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of the devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, or ban the medical devices. The FDA may also issue further warning letters or untitled letters, refuse our request for 510(k) submission or premarket approval, revoke existing 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals previously granted, impose operating restrictions, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees, or us.\nThe MRidium 3860+ or 3850/R MRI compatible IV infusion pumps could be rendered obsolete or economically impractical by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7 entrance of new competitors into our markets;\n\u00b7 loss of key relationships with suppliers, group purchasing organizations, or end-user customers;\n\u00b7 manufacturing or supply interruptions;\n\u00b7 product liability claims;\n\u00b7 our reputation and product market acceptance; and\n\u00b7 product recalls or safety alerts.\nAny major factor adversely affecting the sale of our MRidium 3860+ MRI compatible IV infusion pump would cause our revenues to decline and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and our common stock.\nWe are currently subject to securities class action litigation and derivative litigation and we may be subject to similar or other litigation in the future.\nWe and certain of our officers and/or directors are defendants in a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, brought on behalf of our stockholders that alleges that the defendants failed to disclose material information concerning our compliance with FDA regulations in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the putative class members suffered damages as a result. The lawsuit additionally alleges \u201ccontrol person\u201d liability against the individual defendants under Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The plaintiffs seek to represent a class comprised of purchasers of our common stock during the period from July 15, 2014 through September 2, 2014 and seeks damages, costs and expenses and such other relief as determined by the Court.\nWhile we believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend this lawsuit vigorously, we cannot predict the outcome of this lawsuit. Legal fees and costs incurred in connection with such activities may be significant and we could, in the future, be subject to judgments or enter into settlements of claims for significant monetary damages. With respect to any litigation, our insurance may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for the expenses or losses we may suffer in contesting and concluding such lawsuits. A decision adverse to our interests on these actions or resulting from these matters could result in the payment of substantial damages and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and our common stock. Regardless of the outcome, these claims may result in injury to our reputation, significant costs, diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, and loss of revenue.\nOur continued success depends on the integrity of our supply chain, including multiple single-source suppliers, the disruption of which could negatively impact our business.\nMany of the component parts of our MRidium MRI compatible IV infusion pumps are obtained through supply agreements with third parties. Some of these parts require our partners to engage in complex manufacturing processes. In light of our dependence on third-party suppliers, several of which are single-source suppliers, we are subject to inherent uncertainties and risks related to their ability to produce parts on a timely basis, to comply with product safety and other regulatory requirements and to provide quality parts to us at a reasonable price.\nFor example, we are dependent upon a single vendor for the ultrasonic motor at the core of our MRidium MRI compatible IV infusion pump. If this vendor fails to meet our volume requirements, which we anticipate will increase over time, or if the vendor becomes unable or unwilling to continue supplying motors to us, this would impact our ability to supply our pumps to customers until a replacement source is secured. Our executed agreement with this vendor provides that the price at which we purchase products from the vendor is determined by mutual agreement from time to time or should material costs change. Although we have had a long history of stable pricing with this supplier, this provision may make it difficult for us to continue to receive motors from this vendor on favorable terms or at all if we do not agree on pricing in the future. In such event, it could materially and adversely affect our commercial activities, operating results and financial condition.\nIn the near term, we do not anticipate finding alternative sources for our primary suppliers, including single source suppliers. Therefore, if our primary suppliers become unable or unwilling to manufacture or deliver materials, we could experience protracted delays or interruptions in the supply of materials which would ultimately delay our manufacture of products for commercial sale, which could materially and adversely affect our development programs, commercial activities, operating results and financial condition.\nAdditionally, any failure by us to forecast demand for, or to maintain an adequate supply of, raw materials or finished products could result in an interruption in the supply of certain products and a decline in our sales.\nThe manufacture of our products requires strict adherence to regulatory requirements governing medical devices and if we or our suppliers encounter problems our business could suffer.\nThe manufacture of our pumps and products must comply with strict regulatory requirements governing Class II medical devices in the U.S. and other regulatory requirements in foreign locations. Problems may arise during manufacturing, quality control, storage or distribution of our products for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, manufacturing quality concerns, or problems with raw materials, electromechanical, software and other components, supplier issues, and natural disasters. If problems arise during production of our pump, the batch may have to be discarded. Manufacturing problems or delays could also lead to increased costs, lost sales, damage to customer relations, failure to supply penalties, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches of products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, voluntary recalls, corrective actions or product liability related costs may also be incurred. Should we encounter difficulties in the manufacture of our products or be subject to a product recall, our business could suffer materially.\nWe manufacture and store our products at a single facility in Florida.\nWe manufacture and store our products at a single facility in Winter Springs, Florida. If by reason of fire, hurricane or other natural disaster, or for any other reason, the facility is destroyed or seriously damaged or our access to it is limited, our ability to provide products to our customers would be seriously interrupted or impaired and our operating results and financial condition would be negatively affected.\nOur inability to collect on our accounts receivables held by significant customers may have an adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.\nWe market our products to end users in the United States and to distributors internationally. Sales to end users in the United States are generally made on open credit terms. Management maintains an allowance for potential credit losses. From time to time, we have had accounts receivables from one or two customers that accounted for 10.0% or more of our gross accounts receivable. As a result, we are exposed to a certain level of concentration of credit risk. If a major customer experiences financial difficulties, the effect on us could be material and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain relationships with GPOs, sales of our products could decline.\nOur ability to sell our products to U.S. acute care facilities and outpatient imaging centers depends in part on our relationships with group purchasing organizations (\u201cGPOs\u201d). Many existing and potential customers for our products are members of GPOs. GPOs negotiate pricing arrangements and contracts, which are sometimes exclusive, with medical supply manufacturers and distributors, and these negotiated prices are made available to a GPO\u2019s affiliated hospitals and other members. We pay the GPOs an administrative fee in the form of a percentage of the volume of products sold to their affiliated hospitals and other members. If we are not an approved provider selected by a GPO, affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products. Should a GPO negotiate a sole source or bundling contract covering a future competitor\u2019s products, we may be precluded from making sales to members of that GPO for the duration of the contractual arrangement. Our failure to renew contracts with GPOs may cause us to lose market share and could have a material adverse effect on our sales, financial condition and results of operations. In the future, if another competitive supplier emerges, and we fail to keep our relationships and develop new relationships with GPOs, our competitive position would likely suffer.\nCost-containment efforts of our customers and purchasing groups could adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nOur MRI compatible IV infusion pumps are considered capital equipment by many potential customers, and hence changes in the budgets of healthcare organizations and the timing of spending under these budgets and conflicting spending priorities can have a significant effect on the demand for our products and related services. Any decrease in expenditures by these healthcare facilities could decrease demand for our products and related services and reduce our revenue.\nAny failure in our efforts to educate clinicians, anesthesiologists, radiologists, and hospital administrators regarding the advantages of our products could significantly limit our product sales.\nOur future success will require us to educate a sufficient number of clinicians, anesthesiologists, radiologists, hospital administrators and other purchasing decision-makers about our products and the costs and benefits of MRI compatible IV infusion pump systems. If we fail to demonstrate the safety, reliability and economic benefits of our products to hospitals and acute medical facilities, our products may not be adopted and our sales will suffer.\nThe lengthy sales cycle for the MRidium 3860+ MRI compatible IV infusion pump could delay our sales.\nThe decision-making process of customers is often complex and time-consuming. Based on our experience, we believe the period between initial discussions concerning the MRidium 3860+ MRI compatible IV infusion pump and a purchase of a unit is three to six months. The process can be delayed as a result of capital budgeting procedures. Moreover, even if one or two units are sold to a hospital, we believe that it will take additional time and experience with the MRidium 3860+ MRI compatible IV infusion pump before other medical professionals routinely use the MRidium 3860+ MRI compatible IV infusion pump for other procedures and in other departments of the hospital. Such time would delay potential sales of additional units and disposable tubing or additional optional accessories to that medical facility or hospital. These delays could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we rely on distributors to sell our products outside of the U.S., our revenues could decline if our existing distributors do not continue to purchase products from us or if our relationship with any of these distributors is terminated.\nWe rely on distributors for all of our sales outside the U.S. and hence do not have direct control over foreign sales activities. These distributors also assist us with regulatory approvals and the education of physicians and government agencies. Our revenues outside the U.S. have historically represented approximately one-quarter to one-third of our net revenues, and we intend to continue our efforts to increase our sales in Europe, Japan and other countries. If our existing international distributors fail to sell our products or sell at lower levels than we anticipate, we could experience a decline in revenues or fail to meet our forecasts. We cannot be certain that we will be able to attract new international distributors nor retain existing ones that market our products effectively or provide timely and cost-effective customer support and service. None of our existing distributors are obligated to continue selling our products.\nIf we do not successfully develop and commercialize enhanced products or new products that remain competitive, we could lose revenue opportunities and customers, and our ability to achieve growth would be impaired.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by rapid product development and technological advances, which places our products at risk of obsolescence. Our long-term success depends upon the development and successful commercialization of new products, new or improved technologies and additional applications for non-magnetic infusion technology. The research and development process is time-consuming and costly and may not result in products or applications that we can successfully commercialize. If we do not successfully adapt our technology, products and applications, we could lose revenue opportunities and customers. In addition, we may not be able to improve our products or develop new products or technologies quickly enough to maintain a competitive position in our markets and continue to grow our business.\nWe are highly dependent on our founder, CEO, President, Director and controlling shareholder, Roger Susi.\nRoger Susi developed our MRidium MRI compatible IV infusion pump system, and we believe that he will play a significant role in our continued success and in the development of new products including an MRI compatible device for patient resuscitation. Our current and future operations could be adversely impacted if we were to lose his services. Accordingly, our success will be dependent on appropriately managing the risks related to executing a succession plan for Mr. Susi on a timely basis.\nIf we fail to attract and retain the talent required for our business, our business could be materially harmed.\nCompetition for highly skilled personnel is often intense in the medical device industry, and more specifically in the MRI compatible medical device industry. A number of our executives and employees are former employees of Invivo Corporation, where Mr. Susi developed the first MRI compatible patient monitoring system. If our current employees with experience in the MRI compatible device industry leave our company, we may have difficulty finding replacements with an equivalent amount of experience and skill, which could harm our operations. Our future success will also depend in part on our ability to identify, hire and retain additional personnel, including skilled engineers to develop new products, and executives to oversee our marketing, sales, customer support and production staff. We may not be successful in attracting, integrating or retaining qualified personnel to meet our current growth plans or future needs. Our productivity may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively.\nAlso, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that we have improperly solicited, or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information, or that their former employers own their inventions or work product.\nWe may be unable to scale our operations successfully.\nOur plan is to grow rapidly. Our growth, if it occurs as planned, will place significant demands on our management and manufacturing capacity, as well as our financial, administrative and other resources. We cannot guarantee that any of the systems, procedures and controls we put in place will be adequate to support the manufacture and distribution of our products. Our operating results will depend substantially on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our financial, administrative and other resources. If we are unable to respond to and manage changing business conditions, or the scale of our products, services and operations, then the quality of our services, our ability to retain key personnel and our business could be harmed.\nWe engage in related party transactions, which result in a conflict of interest involving our management.\nWe have engaged in the past, and continue to engage, in related party transactions, particularly between our company and Roger Susi and his affiliates. One significant ongoing related party transaction is the lease agreement between our company and Susi, LLC, an affiliate of Roger Susi, with respect to our sole production and headquarters facility in Winter Springs, Florida. Related party transactions present difficult conflicts of interest, could result in disadvantages to our company and may impair investor confidence, which could materially and adversely affect us. Related party transactions could also cause us to become materially dependent on related parties in the ongoing conduct of our business, and related parties may be motivated by personal interests to pursue courses of action that are not necessarily in the best interests of our company and our stockholders.\nAny acquisitions of technologies, products and businesses, may be difficult to integrate, could adversely affect our relationships with key customers, and/or could result in significant charges to earnings.\nWe plan to periodically review potential acquisitions of technologies, products and businesses that are complementary to our products and that could accelerate our growth. However, our company has never completed an acquisition and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in finding any acquisitions in the future. The process of identifying, executing and realizing attractive returns on acquisitions involves a high degree of uncertainty. Acquisitions typically entail many risks and could result in difficulties in integrating operations, personnel, technologies and products. If we are not able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, we may not obtain the advantages and synergies that the acquisitions were intended to create, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, our ability to develop and introduce new products and the market price of our stock.\nThe environment in which we operate makes it increasingly difficult to forecast our business performance.\nSignificant changes and volatility in the global financial markets, in the consumer and business environment, and our general competitive landscape may make it increasingly difficult for us to predict our revenues and earnings into the future. Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders fulfilled during the quarter, and such orders are difficult to forecast. Product demand is dependent upon the capital spending budgets of our customers and prospects as well as government funding policies, and matters of public policy as well as product and economic cycles that can affect the spending decisions of these entities. As a result, any revenue or earnings guidance or outlook which we have given or might give may turn out to be inaccurate. Though we will endeavor to give reasonable estimates of future revenues and earnings at the time we give such guidance, based on then-current conditions, there is a significant risk that such guidance or outlook will turn out to be incorrect. Historically, companies that have overstated their operating guidance have suffered significant declines in their stock price when such results are announced to the public.\nThere are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States GAAP. Furthermore, portions of GAAP require the use of fair value models which are variable in application and methodology from appraiser to appraiser. Any changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions used could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and operating results.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Such assumptions and estimates include those related to revenue recognition, accruals for product returns, valuation of inventory, impairment of intangibles and long-lived assets, accounting for income taxes and stock-based compensation and reserves for potential litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as discussed in greater detail in the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Our actual operating results may differ and fall below our assumptions and the financial forecasts of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a significant decline in our stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe are subject to substantial government regulation that is subject to change and could force us to make modifications to how we develop, manufacture, market and price our products.\nThe medical device industry is regulated extensively by governmental authorities, principally the FDA in the U.S. and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies. The majority of our manufacturing processes are required to comply with quality systems regulations, including current good manufacturing practice requirements that cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of our products. Failure to comply with applicable medical device regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, repairs, replacements, refunds, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspensions of production, refusal of the FDA or other regulatory agencies to grant pre-market clearances or approvals for our products, withdrawals or suspensions of future current clearances or approvals and criminal prosecution.\nIn addition, our products are subject to pre-approval requirements by the FDA and similar international agencies that govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. Compliance with these regulations may be time consuming, burdensome and expensive for us. The failure to obtain, or the loss or suspension of any such pre-approval, would negatively affect our ability to sell our products, and harm our anticipated revenues.\nForeign governmental authorities that regulate the manufacture and sale of medical devices have become increasingly stringent and, to the extent we sell our products in foreign countries, we may be subject to rigorous regulation in the future. Regulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations, higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated revenue.\nIf we fail to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining, FDA clearances or other necessary approvals to commercially distribute new products, our ability to grow will suffer.\nOur current products are Class II medical devices and hence require regulatory pre-market approval by the FDA and other federal and state authorities prior to their sale in the U.S. Similar approvals are required by foreign governmental authorities for sale of our products outside of the U.S. We are responsible for obtaining the applicable regulatory approval for the commercial distribution of our products. As part of our growth strategy, we plan to seek approvals for new MRI compatible products. The process of obtaining approvals, particularly from the FDA, can be costly and time consuming, and there can be no assurance that we will obtain the required approvals on a timely basis, or at all. Failure to receive approvals for new products will hurt our ability to grow.\nWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the U.S.\nSales to customers outside of the U.S. have historically comprised of approximately one-quarter to one-third of our net revenues and we expect that non-U.S. sales will contribute to future growth. A majority of our international sales originate from Europe and Japan, and we also make sales in Canada, Hong Kong, Australia, Mexico and certain parts of the Middle East. The risks associated with operations outside the United States include:\n\u00b7 foreign regulatory and governmental requirements that could change and restrict our ability to manufacture and sell our products;\n\u00b7 possible failure to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions;\n\u00b7 foreign currency fluctuations that can impact our financial statements when foreign figures are translated into U.S. dollars;\n\u00b7 different local product preferences and product requirements;\n\u00b7 trade protection and restriction measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u00b7 difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing non-U.S. operations;\n\u00b7 failure to maintain relationships with distributors, especially those who have assisted with foreign regulatory or government clearances;\n\u00b7 changes in labor, environmental, health and safety laws;\n\u00b7 potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n\u00b7 political instability and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts;\n\u00b7 economic instability, inflation, deflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7 uncertainties regarding judicial systems and procedures; and\n\u00b7 minimal or diminished protection of intellectual property.\nThese risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may incur product liability losses, or become subject to other lawsuits related to our products, business, and insurance coverage could be inadequate or unavailable to cover these losses.\nOur business is subject to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of our medical devices and consumable products. We carry third party product liability insurance coverage to protect against such risks, but there can be no assurance that our policy is adequate. In the ordinary course of business, we may become the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that our products have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to patients. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could be costly to defend and could result in settlement payments and adjustments not covered by or in excess of our product liability insurance. We currently have third-party product liability insurance with maximum coverage of $3,000,000; however, such coverage requires a substantial deductible that we must pay before becoming eligible to receive any insurance proceeds. The deductible amount is currently equal to $25,000 per occurrence and $125,000 in the aggregate. We will have to pay for defending product liability or other claims that are not covered by our insurance. These payments could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts, recalls or corrective actions, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers. In addition, we may not be able to obtain insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nDefects or failures associated with our products and/or our quality control systems could lead to the filing of adverse event reports, recalls or safety alerts and negative publicity and could subject us to regulatory actions.\nSafety problems associated with our products could lead to a product recall or the issuance of a safety alert relating to such products and result in significant costs and negative publicity. An adverse event involving one of our products could require us to file an adverse event report with the FDA. Such disclosure could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for all of our products, and could harm our reputation and our ability to market our products in the future. In some circumstances, adverse events arising from or associated with the design, manufacture or marketing of our products could result in the suspension or delay of regulatory reviews of our applications for new product approvals or clearances.\nWe may also voluntarily undertake a recall of our products or temporarily shut down production lines based on internal safety, quality monitoring and testing data. For example, in August 2012, we initiated a voluntary recall of a particular lot of MRidium Series 1000 MR Infusion Sets, Type 1058 MR IV, an extension set used with our MRidium MRI compatible IV infusion pumps, due to an out-of-specification dimension of one section of the IV set. We retrieved and destroyed all unused infusion sets subject to the recall. In July 2013, the FDA notified us that it had concluded its audit and confirmed that the recall was considered terminated. In July 2013, we issued a voluntary recall of our MRI compatible IV infusion pump systems equipped with MRidium 1145 DERS Drug Library due to their potential risk in providing an incorrect recommended value for the infusion rate during the pump\u2019s initial infusion setup. To avoid future product recalls we have made and continue to invest in our quality systems, processes and procedures. We will continue to make improvements to our products and systems to further reduce issues related to patient safety. However, there can be no assurance our systems will be sufficient. Future quality concerns, whether real or perceived, could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur products or product types could be subject to negative publicity, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nThe market\u2019s perception of our products could be harmed if any of our products or similar products offered by others in our industry become the subject of negative publicity due to a product safety issue, withdrawal, recall, or are proven or are claimed to be harmful to patients. The FDA Warning Letter may harm the market perception of our company and products. The harm to market perception may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nRecent U.S. healthcare policy changes, including the Affordable Care Act and PPACA, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, the \u201cPPACA\u201d), enacted in March 2010, implemented changes that are expected to significantly impact the medical device industry. Beginning on January 1, 2013, the Affordable Care Act imposed a 2.3% excise tax on sales of products defined as \u201cmedical devices\u201d by the regulations of the FDA. We believe that all of our medical products are \u201cmedical devices\u201d within the meaning of the FDA regulations. If this tax rate is increased in future years, it would negatively impact our operating results.\nOther significant measures contained in the PPACA include research on the comparative clinical effectiveness of different technologies and procedures, initiatives to revise Medicare payment methodologies, such as bundling of payments across the continuum of care by providers and physicians, and initiatives to promote quality indicators in payment methodologies. The PPACA also includes significant new fraud and abuse measures, including required disclosures of financial payments to and arrangements with physician customers, lower thresholds for violations and increasing potential penalties for such violations. In addition, the PPACA established an Independent Payment Advisory Board (\u201cIPAB\u201d), to reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending. The IPAB has broad discretion to propose policies to reduce health care expenditures, which may have a negative impact on payment rates for services, including treatments and procedures which incorporate use of our products. The IPAB proposals may impact payments for treatments and procedures that use our technology beginning in 2016 and for hospital services beginning in 2020, and may indirectly reduce demand for our products.\nThe taxes imposed by the new federal legislation and the expansion in government\u2019s effect on the U.S. healthcare industry may result in decreased profits to us, lower reimbursements by payers for our products or reduced medical procedure volumes, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulations that could result in significant liability, require us to change our business practices and restrict our operations in the future.\nWe and our customers are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and Veterans\u2019 Administration health programs and health programs outside the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to alter one or more of our sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability and financial condition. Furthermore, since many of our customers rely on reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental programs to cover a substantial portion of their expenditures, if we or our customers are excluded from such programs as a result of a violation of these laws, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We have developed and implemented business practices and processes to train our personnel to perform their duties in compliance with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and conduct informal oversight to detect and prevent these types of fraud and abuse. However, we lack formal written policies and procedures at this time. If we are unable to formally document and implement the controls and procedures required in a timely manner or we are otherwise found to be in violation of such laws, we might suffer adverse regulatory consequences or face criminal sanctions, which could harm our operations, financial reporting or financial results.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We intend to adopt policies for compliance with these anti-bribery laws, which often carry substantial penalties. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or other inappropriate acts committed by our affiliates, employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nWe and our suppliers and customers are required to obtain regulatory approvals to comply with FDA regulations applicable to medical devices and infusion pumps, and these approvals could result in delays or increased costs in developing new products.\nIn December 2014, the FDA issued guidance entitled \u201cInfusion Pumps Total Product Life Cycle.\u201d This guidance established substantial additional pre-market requirements for new and modified infusion pumps. Through this guidance, the FDA indicated more data demonstrating product safety will be required for future 510(k) submissions for infusion pumps, including the potential for more clinical and human factors data. The process for obtaining regulatory approvals to market infusion pumps and related accessories have become more costly and time consuming. The impact of this guidance is likely to result in a more time consuming and costly process to obtain regulatory clearance to market infusion pumps. In addition, new requirements could result in longer delays for the clearance of new products, modification of existing infusion pump products or remediation of existing products in the market. Future delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals could result in delayed or no realization of product revenues.\nWe and our suppliers and customers are required to maintain compliance with FDA regulations applicable to medical devices and infusion pumps, and it could be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes. Failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to sanctions and could adversely affect our business.\nEven if we are able to obtain approval for introducing new products to the market, we and our suppliers may not be able to remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other material regulatory requirements once clearance or approval has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, off-label marketing, advertising and post-marketing reporting, adverse event reports and field alerts. Compliance with these FDA requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA. For example, the FDA conducted routine inspections of our facility in Winter Park, Florida in June 2010 and more recently between April 7 and April 16, 2014. The FDA issued a Form 483 on April 16, 2014 that identified eight observations. As described above, the FDA subsequently issued a Warning Letter that has resulted in us ceasing to distribute our primary product in the United States. See the risk factor entitled, \u201cOur financial performance is currently dependent on a single product and the FDA has issued a warning letter requesting that we immediately cease commercial distribution of such product.\u201d\nIn addition, manufacturing flaws, component failures, design defects, off-label uses or inadequate disclosure of product related information could result in an unsafe condition or the injury or death of a patient. All of these events could harm our sales, margins and profitability in the affected periods and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Any adverse regulatory action or action taken by us to maintain appropriate regulatory compliance, with respect to these laws and regulations could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability and financial condition. Furthermore, an adverse regulatory action with respect to any of our products or operating procedure or to our or our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facility could materially harm our reputation in the marketplace.\nOur operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, with which compliance is costly and which exposes us to penalties for non-compliance.\nOur business, products, and product candidates are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, worker health and safety and the use, management, storage, and disposal of hazardous substances, waste, and other regulated materials. These environmental laws and regulations could require us to pay for environmental remediation and response costs at third-party locations where we dispose of or recycle hazardous substances. The costs of complying with these various environmental requirements, as they now exist or as may be altered in the future, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to our Intellectual Property\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property.\nWe intend to rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights to our technologies and products. We cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken or will take to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate or that they will deter infringement, misappropriation or violation of our intellectual property. We may fail to secure patents that are important to our business, and we cannot guarantee that any pending U.S. trademark or patent application, if ultimately issued, will provide us some relative competitive advantage. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights. Any litigation could result in substantial expenses and may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, the laws of some of the countries in which our products may in the future be sold may not protect our products and intellectual property to the same extent as U.S. laws, or at all. We may be unable to protect our rights in trade secrets and unpatented proprietary technology in these countries. If our trade secrets become known, we may lose our competitive advantages.\nEven if we are able to secure necessary patents in the U.S., we may not be able to secure necessary patents and trademarks in foreign countries in which we sell our products or plan to sell our products. In March 2013, the U.S. transitioned to a \u201cfirst inventor to file\u201d system for patents in which, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application is entitled to a patent. We may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter parties review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third party patent rights.\nOur unpatented trade secrets, know-how, confidential and proprietary information, and technology may be inadequately protected.\nWe rely on unpatented trade secrets, know-how and technology. This intellectual property is difficult to protect, especially in the medical device industry, where much of the information about a product must be submitted to regulatory authorities during the regulatory approval process. We seek to protect trade secrets, confidential information and proprietary information, in part, by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees, consultants, and others. These parties may breach or terminate these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for such breaches. Furthermore, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other confidential or proprietary information or result in the effective assignment to us of intellectual property, and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information or other breaches of the agreements. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and our other confidential and proprietary information, we or our collaboration partners, board members, employees, consultants, contractors, or scientific and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary information to competitors.\nThere is a risk that our trade secrets and other confidential and proprietary information could have been, or could, in the future, be shared by any of our former employees with, and be used to the benefit of, any company that competes with us.\nIf we fail to maintain trade secret protection or fail to protect the confidentiality of our other confidential and proprietary information, our competitive position may be adversely affected. Competitors may also independently discover our trade secrets. Enforcement of claims that a third party has illegally obtained and is using trade secrets is expensive, time consuming and uncertain. If our competitors independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, we would not be able to assert our trade secret protections against them, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThere can be no assurance of timely patent review and approval to minimize competition and generate sufficient revenues.\nThere can be no assurance that the Patent and Trademark Office will have sufficient resources to review our patent applications in a timely manner. Consequently, even if our patent applications are ultimately successful, our patent applications may be delayed, which would prevent intellectual property protection for our products. If we fail to successfully commercialize our products due to the lack of intellectual property protection, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to meet or grow our business according to our expected goals and this may have a materially adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition, and operations.\nWe may become involved in patent litigation or other intellectual property proceedings relating to our future product approvals, which could result in liability for damages or delay or stop our development and commercialization efforts.\nThe medical device industry has been characterized by significant litigation and other proceedings regarding patents, patent applications, and other intellectual property rights. The situations in which we may become parties to such litigation or proceedings may include any third parties (which may have substantially greater resources than we have) initiating litigation claiming that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights; in such case, we will need to defend against such proceedings.\nThe large number of patents, the rapid rate of new patent applications and issuances, the complexities of the technologies involved and the uncertainty of litigation significantly increase the risks related to any patent litigation. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u00b7 stop selling, making, or using products that use the disputed intellectual property;\n\u00b7 obtain a license from the intellectual property owner to continue selling, making, licensing, or using products, which license may require substantial royalty payments and may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u00b7 pay substantial damages or royalties to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing;\n\u00b7 pay the attorney fees and costs of litigation to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing; or\n\u00b7 redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property, which could be costly, disruptive and/or infeasible.\nIf any of the foregoing events occur, we may have to withdraw existing products from the market or may be unable to commercialize one or more of our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. As the number of participants in our industry grows, the possibility of intellectual property infringement claims against us increases.\nFurthermore, the costs of resolving any patent litigation or other intellectual property proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other intellectual property proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Patent litigation and other intellectual property proceedings may also consume significant management time.\nIn the event that a competitor infringes upon our patent or other intellectual property rights, enforcing those rights may be costly, difficult, and time-consuming. Even if successful, litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenge could be expensive and time-consuming and could divert our management\u2019s attention. We may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patent or other intellectual property rights against a challenge. If we are unsuccessful in enforcing and protecting our intellectual property rights and protecting our products, it could materially harm our business.\nThere may also be situations where we use our business judgment and decide to market and sell products, notwithstanding the fact that allegations of patent infringement(s) have not been finally resolved by the courts (i.e., an \u201cat-risk launch\u201d). The risk involved in doing so can be substantial because the remedies available to the owner of a patent for infringement may include, among other things, damages measured by the profits lost by the patent owner and not necessarily by the profits earned by the infringer. In the case of a willful infringement, the definition of which is subjective, such damages may be increased up to three times. An adverse decision could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nIn addition, we may indemnify our customers and distributors with respect to infringement by our products of the proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers or distributors. These claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers or distributors, regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers or distributors or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use. If we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our customers may be forced to stop using our products.\nWe may be subject to claims that we, our board members, employees or consultants have used or disclosed alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information belonging to third parties and any such individuals who are currently affiliated with one of our competitors may disclose our proprietary technology or information.\nAs is commonplace in the medical device industry, some of our board members, employees and consultants are or have been associated with other medical device companies that compete with us. For example, Mr. Susi and a number of our other employees are former employees of Invivo Corporation. While associated with such other medical device companies, these individuals may have been exposed to research and technology similar to the areas of research and technology in which we are engaged. We may become subject to future claims that we, our employees, board members, or consultants have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of those companies. Litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims.\nWe have entered into confidentiality agreements with our executives and key consultants. However, we do not have, and are not planning to enter into, any confidentiality agreements with our non-executive directors because they have a fiduciary duty of confidentiality as directors. There is the possibility that any of our former board members, employees, or consultants who are currently employed at, or associated with, one of our competitors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary technology or information.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur common stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations and volatility, and you may be unable to sell your shares at a fair price, or at all.\nOur stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, including the following:\n\u00b7 a lack of liquidity in the public trading of our common stock;\n\u00b7 the commercial success or failure of our key products;\n\u00b7 delayed or reduced orders from our customers;\n\u00b7 manufacturing or supply interruptions;\n\u00b7 changes or developments in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates;\n\u00b7 introduction of competitive products or technologies;\n\u00b7 poorly executed acquisitions or acquisitions whose projected potential is not realized;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7 failure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of securities analysts or investors;\n\u00b7 varying economic and market conditions in the U.S.;\n\u00b7 negative developments impacting the medical device industry in general and changes in the market valuations of companies deemed similar to us;\n\u00b7 negative developments concerning our sources of manufacturing supply;\n\u00b7 disputes or other developments relating to patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 litigation or investigations involving us, our industry, or both;\n\u00b7 issuances of debt, equity or convertible securities at terms deemed unfavorable by the market;\n\u00b7 major catastrophic events;\n\u00b7 the expiration of contractual lock-up agreements;\n\u00b7 sales of large blocks of our stock;\n\u00b7 exercise of the underwriters\u2019 warrant that may lead to sales that put downward pressure on our stock price;\n\u00b7 changes in our Board of Directors, management or key personnel; or\n\u00b7 the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nAny one of the factors above, or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above, may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results, fluctuations in our share price and investors\u2019 perception of our business. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations, our business and stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nFuture sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline.\nIn July 2014, we sold approximately 2.3 million shares of common stock in our initial public offering, and such shares are registered and freely tradable. If these stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. In addition, our directors, officers and stockholders who beneficially own approximately 8.4 million shares of common stock, which were subject to lock-up agreements that expired in January 2015. As a result, up to approximately 1.0 million shares became eligible for sale in the public market and approximately 7.4 million shares held by affiliates became eligible for sale subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Moreover, we filed a registration statement under Form S-8 to register all of the shares issuable upon exercise of options outstanding or reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nWe may need or choose to raise additional capital in the future, which could result in dilution to our stockholders and adversely affect stock price.\nWhile we believe the proceeds from our recent initial public offering will provide us with adequate capital to fund operations for at least the next 12 months, we may need or choose to raise additional funds prior to that time. We may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain an additional credit facility, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms, or at all. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, these securities could have rights that are senior to holders of common stock and any debt securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. The sale of such securities could hurt demand for our common stock and lead our share price to decline.\nRoger Susi, who serves as a director and an executive officer, owns a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nRoger Susi, our founder, who serves as one of our directors and Chief Executive Officer, and his affiliates beneficially owns a majority of our outstanding common stock. Mr. Susi will be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions. He may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\nMr. Susi\u2019s majority ownership also qualifies our company as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and allows us to opt out of compliance with numerous corporate governance listing requirements.\nIn addition, we qualify for the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption under the corporate governance rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market until such a time as Mr. Susi does not control a majority of our outstanding common stock. As a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we would be permitted to opt out of compliance with the requirements that a majority of our board of directors consist of independent directors, that our Board of Directors\u2019 compensation committee be comprised solely of independent directors, and that director nominees be selected or recommended to the Board of Directors for selection by independent directors. Notwithstanding the availability of these exemptions, we have elected not to rely upon any of the exemptions afforded to a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under NASDAQ rules. A majority of our Board of Directors is comprised of independent directors, our compensation committee is comprised solely of independent directors, and our director nominees are recommended for selection to our Board of Directors by a majority of our independent directors in a vote in which only independent directors may participate. Our compliance is voluntary, however, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to comply with these standards in the future.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nThe continued expansion of our business will require funding. Accordingly, we do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends on shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock. Accordingly, if you purchase shares, realization of a gain on your investment will depend solely on the appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. We may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants to monitor and advise us regarding compliance, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We are investing additional resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe believe that being a public company and compliant with these new rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\nAs a result of becoming a public company, we are obligated to establish and maintain adequate internal controls. Failure to develop and maintain adequate internal controls or to implement new or improved controls could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort. Our internal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We are in the very early stages of the costly and challenging process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective.\nWe will be required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis. However, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), or the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act if we take advantage of the exemptions contained in the JOBS Act. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating. Our remediation efforts may not enable us to avoid a material weakness in the future.\nWe believe that our business practices have become more visible as a public company, and this could impact our competitive environment and our risk of potential litigation.\nAs a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition have become more visible potentially exposing us to new competition and threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. New competition could result in reduced sales of our products and adversely impact our profitability. If lawsuits prevail against us, our business and operating results could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe may and have become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management\u2019s attention from our business and adversely affect our business and could subject us to significant liabilities.\nThe stock markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of small cap medical device companies. These broad market fluctuations as well a broad range of other factors, including the realization of any of the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation is expensive and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our primary business, which could adversely affect our operating results. Any adverse determination in any such litigation or any amounts paid to settle any such actual or threatened litigation could require us to make significant payments. Such payment could have a material impact on how investors view our company and result in a decline in our stock price.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements. We cannot predict if investors will respond negatively to our reliance on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d we have also chosen to take advantage of certain provisions of the JOBS Act that allow us to provide you with less information in our public filings than would otherwise be required. As a result it may be more difficult for you to evaluate an investment in our company.\nIf securities or industry analysts fail to initiate research coverage of our stock, downgrade our stock, or discontinue coverage, our trading volume might never develop and our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends, in part, on the research reports that securities or industry analysts publish about our business. If securities or industry analysts do not commence or continue coverage of our company, trading market for our stock may not be robust and the price of our stock could likely be negatively impacted. In the event securities or industry analysts initiate coverage, and later downgrade our stock, our stock price could decline.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law have provisions that may discourage an acquisition of us by others and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our charter documents, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), could depress the trading price of our common stock by making it more difficult for a third party to acquire us at a price favorable to our shareholders. These provisions include:\n\u00b7 authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval to defend against a takeover attempt; and\n\u00b7 establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors. We are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by our Board of Directors. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders, which could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 14807, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "IRMD"}
