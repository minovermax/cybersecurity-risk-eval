Risk Factors.\nThere are risks, many beyond our control, which could cause our results to differ significantly from management\u2019s expectations. Some of these risk factors are described below. Any factor described in this report could, by itself or together with one or more other factors, adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to not be material also may materially and adversely affect us. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to other information disclosed in our SEC filings, including the financial statements and notes thereto.\nMARKET AND LIQUIDITY RISKS\nChallenging economic conditions or volatility in the financial markets could have a material adverse impact on our business, leading to diminished financial results and position.\nOur profitability depends to a large extent on IBERIABANK\u2019s net interest income, which is the difference between income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We are unable to predict changes in market interest rates, which are affected by many factors beyond our control, including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, competition for loans and deposits, domestic and international events and changes in the United States and other financial markets.\nAlthough the general economic environment has shown improvement since the end of the economic recession in June 2009, there can be no assurance that improvement will continue. Economic growth has been slow and uneven, and continuing concerns over the federal deficit and government spending have contributed to diminished expectations for the economy. A return of recessionary conditions, including declines in real estate values and sales volumes, an increase in unemployment, and/or continued negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect economic conditions in the market areas in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, supply of and demand for deposits, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability.\nIn addition, geopolitical matters, including international political unrest, slow growth in the global economy, continued concerns over the oil supply and depressed energy prices, as well as acts of terrorism, war and other violence could result in further disruptions in the financial markets. These negative events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, including our liquidity position, and may affect our ability to access capital.\nThe geographic concentration of our markets makes our business highly susceptible to local economic conditions. Adverse economic factors affecting particular geographies or industries, especially the Southeastern U.S. or the energy industry, could have a negative effect on our customers and their ability to make payments to us.\nUnlike larger organizations that are more geographically diversified, our offices are primarily concentrated in selected markets in Louisiana, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas. As a result of this geographic concentration, our financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas.\nCertain industry-specific economic factors affect these geographies. Approximately 4.8% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 was comprised of loans to borrowers in the energy industry, primarily in Louisiana and Texas. The energy industry is historically cyclical and is currently experiencing a significant and prolonged decline in crude oil prices caused by increased domestic and international production, leading to excess supply, coupled with slowing global economic growth and weaker global demand. In January 2016, oil prices reached a 12-year low at less than $27 per barrel. In addition, the lifting of international economic sanctions on Iran could lead to additional supply and further deterioration of oil prices in 2016.\nA continued severe and prolonged depression in commodity prices would adversely affect the energy industry and the broader financial markets, and consequently negatively impact our business. A downturn in segments of the commercial and residential real estate industries in our markets due to adverse economic factors affecting particular industries could have an adverse effect on our customers. Deterioration in economic conditions in the markets we serve could result in one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nan increase in loan delinquencies;\n\u2022\nan increase in problem assets and foreclosures;\n\u2022\na decrease in the demand for our products and services;\n\u2022\na decrease in the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate, in turn reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power, the value of assets associated with problem loans and collateral coverage;\n\u2022\na decrease in supply of customer deposits, which could impact our liquidity.\nThe Government\u2019s responses to economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (\u201cFOMC\u201d) of the Federal Reserve Board (\u201cFRB\u201d), in an attempt to stimulate the overall economy, has, among other things, kept interest rates low through its targeted federal funds rate. In December 2015, the FOMC voted to raise the target federal funds rate for the first time since 2006. The FOMC expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate over the next several years. As the FOMC increases the federal funds rate, it is possible that overall interest rates could rise, which may negatively impact the U.S. real estate markets and economic recovery. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nChanges in interest rates and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our earnings and financial condition, and we may incur losses if we are unable to successfully manage interest rate risk.\nOur net interest income may be reduced if more interest-earning assets than interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature during a period when interest rates are declining, or more interest-bearing liabilities than interest-earning assets reprice or mature during a period when interest rates are rising.\nChanges in the difference between short- and long-term interest rates may also harm our business. For example, short-term deposits may be used to fund longer-term loans. When differences between short-term and long-term interest rates shrink or disappear, as is possible in the current low interest rate policy environment, the spread between rates paid on deposits and received on loans could narrow significantly, thereby decreasing our net interest income.\nIf market interest rates rise rapidly, interest rate adjustment caps may limit increases in interest rates on adjustable rate loans, thereby reducing our net interest income. Similarly, interest rate adjustment floors may limit the upside benefit to increases in interest rates. In the event that market interest rates fall rapidly, loan and bond prepayments may occur as borrowers refinance and pay off debt prior to stated maturity. As a result, yields on earning assets could decline, thereby reducing net interest income. If an unprecedented negative rate environment were to occur, our operations and margin would be adversely impacted and could result in increased credit losses.\nWe attempt to manage our risk from changes in market interest rates by adjusting the rates, maturity, repricing characteristics, and balances of the different types of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate risk management techniques are not exact. We employ the use of models and modeling techniques to quantify the levels of risks to net interest income, which inherently involve the use of assumptions, judgments, and estimates. While we strive to ensure the accuracy of our modeled interest rate risk profile, there are inherent limitations and imprecisions in this determination and actual results may differ. As of December 31, 2015, a 100 basis point instantaneous and parallel upward shift in interest rates at December 31, 2015, was estimated to increase net interest income over 12 months by approximately 4.9%. Similarly, a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates was expected to decrease net interest income by 4.5% over the same period.\nAt December 31, 2015, approximately 48% of our total loan portfolio had fixed interest rates. Eliminating fixed rate loans that mature within a one-year time frame decreases this percentage to approximately 32% at December 31, 2015. Over 90% of the investment portfolio had fixed interest rates as of December 31, 2015. Approximately 65% of our time deposit base and 51% of our Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") borrowings will re-price within 12 months.\nIf we or our subsidiaries were unable to borrow funds through access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers, or the operating cash needs to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities.\nLiquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. IBERIABANK\u2019s liquidity primarily is used to make loans and to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers. Liquidity policies and limits are established by our Board of Directors. Management and the Investment Committee regularly monitor the overall liquidity position of IBERIABANK and the Company to ensure that various alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. Management and the Investment Committee also establish policies and monitor guidelines to\ndiversify IBERIABANK\u2019s funding sources to avoid concentrations in any one market source. Funding sources include federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, customer deposits, and short- and long-term debt. IBERIABANK is also a member of the FHLB System, which provides funding through advances to members that are collateralized with mortgage-related assets.\nWe maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity. There are other sources of liquidity available to us should they be needed. These sources include sales or securitizations of loans, our ability to acquire additional national market, non-core or brokered deposits, additional collateralized borrowings such as the FRB discount window, the issuance and sale of debt securities, and the issuance and sale of preferred or common securities in public or private offerings. Amounts available under our existing credit facilities as of December 31, 2015 consist of $4.6 billion in FHLB availability and $155 million in the form of federal funds lines and $25 million in other lines of credit.\nIf we were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed, we might be unable to meet customers\u2019 needs, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital.\nAdditionally, the Company is often the recipient of dividends from its subsidiaries, including IBERIABANK, and may rely on these dividends as a source of cash flow. The amount of future dividends from IBERIABANK is dependent upon its performance and could be impacted by future unanticipated economic conditions and regulatory limitations. Such events could impact the Company\u2019s ability to declare future dividends and ultimately its solvency if other sources of cash flows were not available.\nDeposit run-off or a change in deposit mix could increase our funding costs.\nA major portion of our net income comes from our interest rate spread, which is the difference between the interest rates paid by us on amounts used to fund assets and the interest rates and fees we receive on our interest-earning assets. We rely on deposits as a stable, low-cost source of funding for our interest-earning assets. We must compete with other banks and financial institutions for deposits. If our competitors raise rates on their deposits, we may face deposit attrition or experience higher funding costs by increasing our deposit rates in order to maintain our customer deposit base. Higher funding costs would increase interest expense, thereby reducing our net interest margin, net interest income, and net income. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 27% of our deposits were non-interest-bearing.\nMarket perceptions of our credit risk could impair our liquidity, cash flows, financial condition and operating results.\nOur liquidity and borrowing costs are largely impacted by our credit risk. Market perception, given the lack of a public credit rating, could have an adverse effect on our ability to access capital markets or borrow funds and increase the costs of capital and borrowings. In addition, deterioration in our credit risk, whether actual or perceived, could trigger unfavorable contractual obligations, resulting in the requirement to post additional collateral or realize credit-related contingent features.\nCREDIT RISKS\nLike most banking organizations, our business is highly susceptible to credit risk.\nAs a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that the collateral securing the payment of their loans (if any) may not be sufficient to satisfy our customers\u2019 loan obligations in the event of default. Credit losses could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our total loan portfolio was approximately $14.3 billion, or 73% of total assets. At that date, the major components of our loan portfolio comprised 71% commercial loans (42% real estate, 24% commercial and industrial, and 5% energy), 8% mortgage loans (primarily residential 1-4 family mortgage loans), and 21% consumer loans. Our credit risk with respect to our consumer installment and commercial loan portfolios relates principally to the general creditworthiness of individuals and businesses within our local market areas. Our credit risk with respect to our residential and commercial real estate mortgage and construction loan portfolios relates principally to the general creditworthiness of individuals and businesses, the value of real estate as collateral, and guarantors serving as security for the repayment of the loans.\nOur loan portfolio has been and will continue to be affected by real estate markets. Real estate industry pricing dynamics in the geographical markets we operate can vary from year to year, and with respect to construction, can vary between project\nfunding and project completion. Asset values to which we underwrite loans can fluctuate from year to year and impact collateral values and the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. An additional risk in connection with loans secured by commercial real estate is the effect of unknown or unexpected environmental contamination, which could make the real estate effectively unmarketable or otherwise significantly reduce its value as security, or could expose us to remediation liabilities as the lender. In addition, the energy industry is currently experiencing a significant and prolonged decline in crude oil prices caused by oversupply and weaker global demand, which is having a negative impact on both commercial and consumer borrowers. We make credit and reserve decisions based on the current conditions of borrowers or projects combined with our expectations for the future. If a deterioration in economic conditions or prices beyond our expectations were to occur in any of the market areas we serve, we could experience higher charge-offs and delinquencies above amounts provided for in the allowance for credit losses. As such, our earnings could be adversely affected through higher than anticipated provisions for loan losses.\nOur allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover actual credit losses, which could adversely affect our earnings. Events unforeseen by us could result in higher loan losses impacting our results of operations.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses (\u201callowance\u201d) in an attempt to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio (funded and unfunded). Additional loan losses will likely occur in the future and may occur at a rate greater than we have experienced to date based on unanticipated adverse changes and/or new facts and circumstances which are currently not available to management as of the respective reporting period. Increases in the allowance will result in decreases in our earnings.\nThe determination of the allowance, which represents management\u2019s estimate of probable losses inherent in our credit portfolio, involves a high degree of judgment and complexity. Changes in these estimates (i.e., creditworthiness) may have a significant impact on our financial statements. If our assumptions and judgments require modifications, our current allowance may not be sufficient and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio. Further, changes in market factors, such as interest rates or commodity prices, could lead to increases in the allowance. While management monitors these market dynamics carefully, adverse changes to these factors could be unforeseen by management and would result in higher levels of allowance and credit losses. For example, unanticipated adjustments to management\u2019s current expectations in commodity prices (e.g., oil) could have an adverse impact to the allowance as the borrower\u2019s ability to repay within the terms of the contractual agreement may be reduced due to a lack of sufficient free cash flows, estimated collateral values may decline given the lack of market demand for collateralized assets (e.g., equipment, pipelines, etc.), and the Company\u2019s ability to monetize guarantor support may be impaired as guarantor net worth may diminish.\nCommercial and commercial real estate loans generally are viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or other loans or investments. These types of loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and other consumer loans. Because the loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of a material amount of these loans may cause a significant increase in nonperforming assets, TDRs and/or past due loans. An increase in nonperforming assets, TDRs, and/or past due loans could result in a loss of earnings, an increase in the provision for credit losses, or an increase in loan charge-offs, which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Our emphasis on loan growth and on increasing our portfolio of multi-family, commercial business and commercial real estate loans, as well as any future credit deterioration, could also require us to increase our allowance further in the future.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance and may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or recognize further loan charge-offs.\nWe earn a significant portion of our non-interest revenue through sales of residential mortgages in the secondary market. We are exposed to counterparty credit, market, repurchase and other risks associated with these activities.\nOur non-interest revenue attributable to mortgage banking activities has grown significantly in recent years. The Company is exposed to counterparty credit risk in the normal course of these sales activities as well as market risk when engaging in these activities that is greatly impacted by the amount of liquidity in the secondary markets and changes in interest rates. Additionally, the Company retains repurchase risk associated with sales of these loans that is related to the Company\u2019s residential mortgage loan underwriting and closing practices. Increases in claims under these repurchase or make-whole demands, which typically arise when a borrower defaults, could have a material impact on our ability to continue participating in these types of activities as well as a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe protections afforded through the loss share agreements with the FDIC could be compromised by factors outside of the Company\u2019s control, resulting in significant losses.\nThe loss share agreements associated with our FDIC-assisted transactions represented $40 million on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. To the extent that loss share coverage ends prior to events that would allow the Company to collect these amounts, future impairments would be required. The terms of the loss share agreements require us to remit to the FDIC recoveries on prior loss claims on certain loans within our portfolio, which could negatively impact our net income subsequent to loss share termination. Application of the terms and conditions of loss share agreements is subject to the interpretation by the FDIC. To the extent the FDIC develops new or differing interpretations of the terms and conditions of loss share agreements, our indemnification assets could become impaired or we could be required to refund the FDIC for payments previously received.\nDeclines in the value of certain investment securities could require write-downs, which would reduce our earnings.\nOur securities portfolio includes securities that are subject to declines in value due to negative perceptions about the health of the financial sector in general and the lack of liquidity for securities that are real estate related. A prolonged decline in the value of these or other securities could result in an other-than-temporary impairment write-down, which would reduce our earnings. In the case of issuer default, a permanent impairment could be required that would reduce our earnings.\nIf our investment in the common stock of the FHLB of Dallas is classified as other-than-temporarily impaired or as permanently impaired, our earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity could decrease.\nWe hold FHLB stock to qualify for membership in the FHLB System and to be eligible to borrow funds under the FHLB advance program. The aggregate cost and fair value of our FHLB common stock as of December 31, 2015 was $16 million based on its par value. There is no market for FHLB common stock.\nPublished reports indicate that certain member banks of the FHLB System may be subject to accounting rules and asset quality risks that could result in materially lower regulatory capital levels. In an extreme situation, it is possible that the capital of a FHLB could be substantially diminished or reduced to zero. Consequently, we believe that there is a risk that our investment in FHLB common stock could be impaired at some time in the future and, if this occurs, it would cause our earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity to decrease by the after-tax amount of the impairment charge.\nREGULATORY/COMPLIANCE RISK\nChanges in government regulations and legislation could limit our future performance and growth.\nThe banking industry is heavily regulated. We are subject to examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies. Our compliance is costly and restricts certain of our activities. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect the federal deposit insurance fund and depositors, not shareholders. The burdens imposed by federal and state regulations put banks at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors, such as finance companies, mortgage banking companies and leasing companies. Changes in the laws, regulations and regulatory practices affecting the banking industry may increase our costs of doing business or otherwise adversely affect us and create competitive advantages for others. Regulations affecting banks and financial services companies undergo continuous change and are subject to interpretation. We cannot predict the ultimate effect of these changes or interpretations, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability or financial condition.\nThe ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and related rules and regulations may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act contains a variety of far-reaching changes and reforms for the financial services industry and directed federal regulatory agencies to study the effects of, and to issue implementing regulations for, these reforms. Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act could have a direct effect on our performance and, in some cases, impact our ability to conduct business. Examples of these provisions include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nCreation of the Financial Stability Oversight Council that may recommend to the FRB increasingly strict rules\nfor capital, leverage, liquidity, risk management and other requirements as companies grow in size and complexity;\n\u2022\nApplication of the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies, such as IBERIABANK Corporation;\n\u2022\nChanges to the assessment base used by the FDIC to assess insurance premiums from insured depository institutions and increases to the minimum reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund (\u201cDIF\u201d), from 1.15% to not less than 1.35%, with provisions to require institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more, like us, to bear a greater portion of the costs associated with increasing the DIF\u2019s reserve ratio;\n\u2022\nRepeals of the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts;\n\u2022\nEstablishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, with broad authority to write rules, and implement and enforce consumer financial protection laws, including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive, and abusive practices.\u201d The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with $10 billion or more in assets, like IBERIABANK, with respect to compliance with consumer financial protection laws;\n\u2022\nImplementation of risk retention rules for loans (excluding qualified residential mortgages) that are sold by a bank;\n\u2022\nAmendment of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to, among other things, authorize the FRB to issue rules limiting debit-card interchange fees (referred to as the \u201cDurbin Amendment\u201d); and\n\u2022\nNew restrictions on compensation, including a prohibition on incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk-taking by covered financial institutions and are deemed to be excessive or that may lead to material losses,\nMany of these provisions have already been the subject of proposed and final rulemakings. Some other provisions, however, remain subject to final regulatory rulemaking and implementation, the effects of which are not yet known. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and any rules adopted to implement those provisions, as well as any additional legislative or regulatory changes, may impact the profitability of our business activities, may require that we change certain of our business practices, may materially affect our business model or affect retention of key personnel, may require us to raise additional capital and could expose us to additional costs (including increased compliance costs). These and other changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as previously conducted or our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires us to submit a stress test to the FRB that projects the Company\u2019s performance under various economic scenarios provided by the FRB. We are required to make certain assumptions in modeling future performance and must support these assumptions through statistical analysis and observed market behavior where applicable. The outcome of the FRB\u2019s analysis of the Company\u2019s projected performance (to include capital, earnings, and balance sheet changes) could hinder our ability to pay cash dividends to shareholders as has been the Company\u2019s practice. The results of the stress test could also impact the FRB\u2019s future decision making regarding future acquisitions by the Company.\nWe have become subject to more stringent regulatory capital requirements, which may limit our operations and potential growth or adversely affect our ability to pay dividends or to repurchase shares.\nThe Company and IBERIABANK are subject to the comprehensive, consolidated supervision and regulation of the FRB and the Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions, including risk-based and leverage capital requirements. We must maintain certain risk-based and leverage capital ratios as required by our banking regulators, which can change depending on general economic conditions and the Company\u2019s particular condition, risk profile, growth plans, and regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. If at any time we fail to meet minimum established capital guidelines and/or other regulatory requirements, our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nIn July 2013, U.S. banking regulatory agencies, including the FRB, approved a final rule to implement the revised capital adequacy standards of the Basel Committee, or \u201cBasel III\u201d, and to address relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. We became subject to the new rule on January 1, 2015, and certain provisions of the new rule will be phased in from that date to\nJanuary 1, 2019.\nThe final rule:\n\u2022\nRequires that non-qualifying capital instruments, including trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock, must be fully phased out of Tier 1 capital by January 1, 2016;\n\u2022\nEstablishes new qualifying criteria for regulatory capital, including new limitations on the inclusion of deferred tax assets and mortgage servicing rights;\n\u2022\nRequires a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1, or CET1, capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%;\n\u2022\nIncreases the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio requirements from 4% to 6%;\n\u2022\nRetains the minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio requirement of 8%;\n\u2022\nEstablishes a minimum leverage ratio requirement of 4%;\n\u2022\nRetains the existing regulatory capital framework for 1-4 family residential mortgage exposures;\n\u2022\nRequires a banking organization to maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% (consisting of CET1 capital) above the minimum CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total risk-based capital ratios in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning on January 1, 2016 at 0.625%, and will be fully phased in at 2.5% by January 1, 2019. A banking organization with a buffer of less than the required amount would be subject to increasingly stringent limitations on such distributions and payments as the buffer approaches zero;\n\u2022\nIncreases capital requirements for past-due loans, high volatility commercial real estate exposures, and certain short-term commitments and securitization exposures;\n\u2022\nExpands the recognition of collateral and guarantors in determining risk-weighted assets; and\n\u2022\nRemoves references to credit ratings consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act and establishes due diligence requirements for securitization exposures.\nManagement believes that at December 31, 2015, the Company and IBERIABANK would have met all new capital adequacy requirements on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were then effective. However, there can be no assurances that the Basel III capital rules will not be revised before the expiration of the phase-in periods. The final impact of the new capital and liquidity standards on us cannot be determined at this time and depend on a number of factors, including the treatment and implementation by U.S. banking regulators. These new requirements, however, and any other new regulations, could result in lower returns, result in regulatory actions if we were unable to comply with such requirements, and adversely affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares, or to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Compliance with current or new capital requirements, including leverage ratios, may limit operations that require the intensive use of capital and could adversely affect our ability to expand or maintain present business levels.\nPossible future increases in FDIC deposit insurance premiums would adversely affect our earnings.\nUnder a final rule adopted by the FDIC in 2011 to revise the federal deposit insurance system, deposit insurance assessments for all banks will be lowered starting the quarter after the ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund\u2019s deposit insurance reserves to estimated insured deposits (the \u201cDRR\u201d) reaches 1.15%, which the FDIC currently projects will be the first or second quarter of 2016. In October 2015, the FDIC issued a proposed rule that would require insured institutions with an assessment base (total assets less tangible capital) of over $10 billion to pay surcharge assessments at an annual rate of 4.5 basis points, starting the quarter after the DRR reaches 1.15% and ending when the DRR reaches 1.35% (forecast to occur by the end of 2018). The 4.5 basis point surcharge would be assessed against the assessment base of covered institutions, such as IBERIABANK, less $10 billion.\nWe are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If the number of bank failures increases in the future, the FDIC may set higher deposit insurance premiums or impose special assessments.\nAny future increases in FDIC deposit insurance premiums may materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur reported financial results depend on our management\u2019s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates, and there may be changes in accounting policies or accounting standards that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur accounting policies and assumptions are fundamental to our reported financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results. Our management must also exercise judgment in selecting assumptions and estimates inherent in deriving certain financial statement line items. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy, method, assumption and/or estimate to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in our reporting materially different results than would have been reported under another acceptable alternative.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the form and content of our external financial statements. Recently, the FASB has proposed new accounting standard updates related to the calculation of the allowance for credit losses and accounting for leases, amongst other ancillary proposed updates. The FASB has also issued final accounting standard updates which are not yet effective. A discussion of the recent significant accounting standard updates which have been issued are included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Accounting standard updates have the potential to alter previously issued or future financial statements depending on their deviation from current standards or industry practices and the implementation method prescribed by the FASB. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, banking regulators and our independent registered auditors) may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how standards should be applied. Changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond our control, can be hard to predict and could materially impact how we report our financial results and condition.\nWe are exposed to intangible asset risk, which could negatively impact our financial results.\nIn accordance with GAAP, we record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value, and, as such, acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill. We perform a goodwill evaluation at least annually to test for goodwill impairment. As part of its testing, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount using these qualitative factors, the Company compares the fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount, and then measures impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Adverse conditions in our business climate, including a significant decline in future operating cash flows, a significant change in our stock price or market capitalization, or a deviation from our expected growth rate and performance may significantly affect the fair value of our goodwill and may trigger impairment losses, which could be material to our operating results and financial position.\nWe completed such an evaluation for the Company during the fourth quarter of 2015 and concluded that an impairment charge was not necessary for the year ended December 31, 2015. We cannot provide assurance, however, that we will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future. Any impairment charge would have an adverse effect on our shareholders\u2019 equity and financial results and could cause a decline in our stock price.\nThe required accounting treatment of troubled loans we acquired through acquisitions could result in higher net interest margins and interest income in current periods and lower net interest margins and interest income in future periods.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, we are required to record troubled loans acquired through acquisitions at fair value, which may underestimate or overestimate the actual performance of such loans. If these loans outperform our original fair value estimates, the difference between our original estimate and the actual performance of the loan (the \u201cdiscount\u201d) is accreted into net interest income. Thus, our net interest margins may initially appear higher. Conversely, if these loans under-perform our original fair value estimates, our net interest margins would be lower than initially estimated. We expect the yields on our loans to decline as our acquired loan portfolio pays down or matures, and we expect downward pressure on our interest income to the extent that the runoff on our acquired loan portfolio is not replaced with comparable high-yielding loans. This could result in higher net interest margins and interest income in current periods and lower net interest rate margins and interest income in future periods.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nA failure in or an attack on our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our business, result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause financial losses.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets. These transactions, as well as the information technology services we provide to clients, often must adhere to client-specific guidelines, as well as legal and regulatory standards. Due to the breadth of our client base and our geographical reach, developing and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure is challenging, particularly as a result of rapidly evolving legal and regulatory requirements, technological shifts, integration of new platforms and third party relationships. Our financial, accounting, data processing or other operating systems and facilities, or those of our third party vendors, may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as a spike in transaction volume, cyber attack or other unforeseen catastrophic events, which may adversely affect our ability to process transactions or services.\nIn addition, our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks, as well as those of our third party vendors. Although we take protective measures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our and our clients\u2019 information across all geographic and product lines, and endeavor to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant, the nature of these threats continues to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber attacks and other events that could have an adverse security impact. Despite the defensive measures we take to manage our internal technological and operational infrastructure, these threats may originate externally from third parties such as foreign governments, organized crime and other hackers, and outsource or infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or may originate internally from within our organization. Given the increasingly high volume of our transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they can be discovered and rectified.\nWe also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems, data or infrastructure. In addition, as interconnectivity with our clients grows, we increasingly face the risk of operational failure with respect to our clients\u2019 systems.\nIf one or more of these cyber incidents occurs, it could potentially jeopardize the confidential, proprietary and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, as well as our clients\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 operations, which could result in damage to our reputation, substantial costs, regulatory penalties and/or client dissatisfaction or loss. Potential costs of a cyber incident may include, but would not be limited to, remediation costs, increased protection costs, lost revenue from the unauthorized use of proprietary information or the loss of current and/or future customers, and litigation.\nWe maintain an insurance policy which we believe provides sufficient coverage at a manageable expense for an institution of our size and scope with similar technological systems. However, no assurance can be given that this policy would be sufficient to cover all potential financial losses, damages, penalties, including lost revenues, should we experience any one or more of our or a third party\u2019s systems failing or experiencing attack.\nThe loss of certain key personnel could negatively affect our operations.\nAlthough we have employed a significant number of additional executive officers and other key personnel, our success continues to depend in large part on the retention of a limited number of key executive management, lending and other banking personnel. We could undergo a difficult transition period if we were to lose the services of any of these individuals. Our success also depends on the experience of our banking facilities\u2019 managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve. The loss of these key persons could negatively impact the affected banking operations. The unexpected loss of key senior managers, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nThe success of bank acquisitions (which include FDIC-assisted transactions) will depend on a number of uncertain factors.\nThe success of our bank acquisitions depends on a number of factors, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nOur ability to integrate the businesses acquired into IBERIABANK\u2019s current operations, including the conversion of customer loan and deposit data from the acquired banks\u2019 data processing systems to our data processing systems;\n\u2022\nOur ability to limit the outflow of deposits held by our new customers in the acquired businesses and to successfully retain and manage interest-earning assets (i.e., loans) acquired;\n\u2022\nOur ability to attract new deposits and to generate new interest-earning assets in the geographic areas previously served by the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nOur ability to effectively compete in new markets in which we did not previously have a presence;\n\u2022\nOur success in deploying the cash acquired in these transactions into assets bearing sufficiently high yields without incurring unacceptable risk;\n\u2022\nOur ability to control the incremental non-interest expense from the acquired businesses in a manner that enables us to maintain a favorable overall efficiency ratio;\n\u2022\nOur ability to retain and attract the appropriate personnel to staff and maintain the acquired businesses; and\n\u2022\nOur ability to earn acceptable levels of interest and non-interest income, including fee income, from the acquired businesses.\nIn any acquisition involving a financial institution, particularly one involving the transfer of a large number of bank branches and/or customers, there may be business and service changes and disruptions, including delays or errors in the data conversion process, that result in the loss of customers or cause customers to close their accounts and move their business to competing financial institutions. Integration of such acquired businesses is an operation of substantial size and expense, and may be impacted by general market and economic conditions or government actions affecting the financial services industry. Integration efforts also are likely to divert our management\u2019s attention and resources. No assurance can be given that we will be able to integrate these acquired businesses successfully, and the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of bank acquisitions. We may also encounter unexpected difficulties or costs during the integration that could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition, perhaps materially. Additionally, no assurance can be given that the operation of acquired businesses will not adversely affect our existing profitability, that we will be able to achieve results in the future similar to those achieved by our existing banking business, that we will be able to compete effectively in the market areas currently served by the acquired businesses, or that we will be able to manage any growth resulting from financial institution acquisitions effectively.\nOur ability to grow acquired businesses following these transactions depends in part on our ability to retain certain key branch personnel we expect to hire and/or retain in connection with these transactions. We believe that the ties these employees have in the local banking markets previously served by their acquired businesses are vital to our ability to maintain our relationships with existing customers and to generate new business in these markets. Our failure to hire or retain these employees could adversely affect the success of these transactions and our future growth.\nCatastrophic events could negatively affect our local economies or disrupt our operations, which would have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nThe occurrence of catastrophic events, including weather events and other natural disasters such as hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, floods and fires, or other disasters, such as crime, terrorism and other acts of violence, could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Such events can disrupt our operations, cause damage to our properties and negatively affect the local economies in which we operate. We cannot predict whether or to what extent damage that may be caused by these catastrophes will affect our operations or the economies in our market areas, but such events could result in a decline in loan originations, a decline in the value or destruction of properties securing our loans and an increase in payment delinquencies, foreclosures and loan losses.\nWe may be subject to increased litigation which could result in legal liability and damage to our reputation.\nThe Company and IBERIABANK have been named from time to time as defendants in class actions and other litigation relating to our businesses and activities. Litigation may include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. We and our subsidiaries are also involved from time to time in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our business. These matters also could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.\nIn addition, in recent years, a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed \u201clender liability.\u201d Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty, whether implied or contractual, of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders.\nSubstantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us, including our subsidiaries, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause significant harm to our reputation.\nSTRATEGIC/REPUTATIONAL RISKS\nOur financial performance will be negatively impacted if we are unable to execute our growth strategy, which includes organic growth and growth through acquisitions.\nHistorically, the Company has grown organically and supplemented that growth with select acquisitions. Our success depends primarily on generating loans and deposits of acceptable risk and profitability. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in continuing our organic, or internal, growth strategy. Our ability to identify appropriate markets for expansion, recruit and retain qualified personnel, and fund growth at a reasonable cost, depends upon prevailing economic conditions, maintenance of sufficient capital, competitive factors, changes in banking laws, and other factors.\nSupplementing our internal growth through acquisitions is an important part of our strategic focus, and acquisitions have comprised a significant portion of our asset growth since 1995. Our acquisition efforts focus on select markets and targeted entities. We operate in markets we consider to be contiguous, or natural extensions, to our current markets. The availability of acquisition candidates that meet our strategic objectives can fluctuate, and current institutions for sale in the market may not meet our strategic objectives. Such circumstances would limit our ability to supplement our growth through acquisitions. As consolidation of the banking industry continues, the competition for suitable acquisition candidates may increase. We compete with other banking organizations for acquisition opportunities, and many of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do and may be able to pay more for an acquisition than we are able or willing to pay. We also may need additional debt or equity financing in the future to fund acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain additional financing or, if available, it may not be in amounts and on terms acceptable to us. Our issuance of additional equity securities would dilute existing shareholders\u2019 interest in us and may have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share. If we are unable to locate suitable acquisition candidates willing to combine with us on terms acceptable to us, or we are otherwise unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing necessary for us to continue making acquisitions, we would be required to find other methods to grow our business, and we may not grow at the same rate we have grown in the past, or at all.\nWe cannot be certain as to our ability to manage increased levels of assets and liabilities without increased expenses and higher levels of nonperforming assets. We may be required to make additional investments in equipment and personnel to manage higher asset levels and loan balances, which may adversely affect earnings, shareholder returns, and our efficiency ratio. Increases in operating expenses or nonperforming assets may decrease our earnings and the value of our common stock.\nIn addition to the normal operating challenges inherent in managing a larger financial institution, each of our acquisitions and potential future acquisitions is subject to appropriate regulatory approval. Our regulators may require that we demonstrate that we have appropriately integrated our prior acquisitions, or any future acquisitions we may do, before permitting us to engage in any future material acquisitions.\nThe modeled returns of bank acquisitions will depend on a number of uncertain factors, and actual results could differ materially from our expectations.\nWe undertake a process in performing due diligence on bank acquisition targets. While this process attempts to be comprehensive, factors can arise that were not discovered or anticipated by us in this exercise. Additionally, our modeled returns are based on a variety of assumptions to include synergies, cost savings, credit losses, growth, and the fair value of\nassets, liabilities and contracts acquired. To the extent such factors arise or actual results differ from our assumptions, our actual shareholder returns on any given bank acquisition could differ materially from our modeled expectations.\nOur ability to achieve expense reduction and earnings enhancement initiatives may be adversely affected by external factors not within our control.\nWe continue to assess and implement a number of expense reduction and revenue enhancement initiatives that are expected to result in estimated annual incremental run-rate benefits. While many of the elements necessary to achieve these initiatives are within our control, others such as interest rates and prevailing economic conditions, which influence expenses and revenues, depend on external factors not within our control, and there can be no assurance that external factors will not materially adversely affect our ability to fully implement and accomplish these initiatives.\nOur success depends on our ability to respond to the threats and opportunities of fintech innovation.\nFintech developments, such as bitcoin, have the potential to disrupt the financial industry and change the way banks do business. Investment in new technology to stay competitive would result in significant costs and increased risks of cyber security attacks. Our success depends on our ability to adapt to the pace of the rapidly changing technological environment, which is crucial to retention and acquisition of customers.\nWe face substantial competition and are subject to certain regulatory constraints not applicable to some of our competitors, which may decrease our growth or profits.\nWe face substantial competition for deposits, and for credit, title and trust relationships, and other financial services and products in the communities we serve. Competing providers include other banks, thrifts and trust companies, insurance companies, mortgage banking operations, credit unions, finance companies, title companies, money market funds and other financial and nonfinancial companies which may offer products functionally equivalent to those offered by us. Competing providers may have greater financial resources than we do and offer services within and outside the market areas we serve. In addition to this challenge of attracting and retaining customers for traditional banking services, our competitors include securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors and finance and insurance companies who seek to offer one-stop financial services to their customers that may include services that financial institutions have not been able or allowed to offer to their customers in the past. The increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers. If we are unable to adjust both to increased competition for traditional banking services and changing customer needs and preferences, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nSome of our competitors, including credit unions, are not subject to certain regulatory constraints, such as the Community Reinvestment Act, which, among other things, requires us to implement procedures to make and monitor loans throughout the communities we serve. Credit unions also have federal tax exemptions that may allow them to offer lower rates on loans and higher rates on deposits than taxpaying financial institutions such as commercial banks. In addition, non-depository institution competitors are generally not subject to the extensive regulation applicable to institutions, like IBERIABANK, that offer federally insured deposits. Other institutions may have other competitive advantages in particular markets or may be willing to accept lower profit margins on certain products. These differences in resources, regulation, competitive advantages, and business strategy may decrease our net interest margin, may increase our operating costs, and may make it harder for us to compete profitably.\nReputational risk and social factors may impact our results.\nOur ability to originate and maintain accounts is highly dependent upon consumer and other external perceptions of our business practices and/or our financial health. Adverse perceptions regarding our business practices and/or our financial health could damage our reputation in both the customer and funding markets, leading to difficulties in generating and maintaining accounts as well as in financing them. Adverse developments with respect to the consumer or other external perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, may also adversely impact our reputation. In addition, adverse reputational impacts on third parties with whom we have important relationships may also adversely impact our reputation. Adverse impacts to our reputation, or the reputation of our industry, may lead to greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny and litigation risk. We carefully monitor internal and external developments for areas of potential reputational risk and have established governance structures to assist in evaluating such risks in our business practices and decisions.\nRISKS ABOUT OUR SECURITIES\nWe cannot guarantee that we will pay dividends to shareholders in the future.\nCash available to pay dividends to our shareholders is derived primarily, if not entirely, from dividends paid to us from IBERIABANK. The ability of IBERIABANK to pay dividends to us, as well as our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders, is limited by regulatory and legal restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient consolidated capital. We may also decide to limit the payment of dividends on types and classes of our stock even when we have the legal ability to pay them in order to retain earnings for use in our business. There can be no assurance of whether or when we may pay dividends in the future.\nOur common stock and our preferred stock are subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness.\nShares of our common stock and our Series B preferred stock are equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness of the Company. This means that shares of the common stock and depositary shares, which represent fractional interests in shares of Series B preferred stock, rank junior to all our existing and future indebtedness and our other non-equity claims with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against us, including claims in the event of our liquidation. We are prohibited from paying dividends on any of our capital stock if the required payments on our subordinated debentures have not been made.\nOur common stock is subordinate to our existing and future preferred stock.\nThe Company has outstanding Series B preferred stock that is senior to the common stock and could adversely affect the ability of the Company to declare or pay dividends or distributions of common stock. Under the terms of the Series B preferred stock, the Company is prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock unless all full dividends for the latest dividend period on all outstanding shares of Series B preferred stock have been declared and paid in full or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of those dividends has been set aside. Furthermore, if the Company experiences a material deterioration in its financial condition, liquidity, capital, results of operations or risk profile, the Company\u2019s regulators may not permit it to make future payments on its Series B preferred stock, thereby preventing the payment of dividends on the common stock.\nWe may issue debt and/or equity securities, or securities convertible into equity securities, any of which may be senior to our existing preferred and common stock as to distributions and in liquidation, and such an issuance could negatively affect the value of our common and preferred stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by entering into debt or debt-like financing that is unsecured or secured by all or up to all of our assets, or by issuing additional debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of secured or unsecured commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior notes, subordinated notes, additional shares of Series B or another class of preferred stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities. In the event of our liquidation, our lenders and holders of our debt and preferred securities would receive a distribution of our available assets before distributions to the holders of our common stock. Subject to certain conditions, holders of another class of preferred stock may be entitled to preferences over the Series B preferred stock. Because our decision to incur debt and issue securities in our future offerings will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings and debt financings.\nThe trading history of our common stock is characterized by modest trading volume.\nOur common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. During 2015, the average daily trading volume of our common stock was approximately 238,000 shares. In addition, our depositary shares, which represent fractional shares of our Series B preferred stock began trading on NASDAQ in 2015. From August 5, 2015 (the date of issuance), to December 31, 2015, the average daily trading volume of our depositary shares was approximately 13,800 shares.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in us will lead to a more active trading market in our securities or how much more liquid these markets might become. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends upon the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our securities at any given time, which presence is dependent upon the individual decisions of investors, over which we have no control.\nThe market price of our securities can be volatile.\nThe market prices of our common and preferred stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors, including, but not limited to, the factors discussed in other risk factors and the following:\n\u2022\nour operating performance, financial condition and prospects, or the operating performance, financial condition and prospects of our competitors;\n\u2022\nour creditworthiness;\n\u2022\nprevailing in interest rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in the legal or regulatory environments in which we operate;\n\u2022\npress releases, announcements or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our securities;\n\u2022\nthe markets for similar securities;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic conditions in our marketplace, general conditions in the U.S. economy, financial markets or the banking industry; and\n\u2022\nother developments affecting our competitors or us.\nThese factors may adversely affect the trading prices of our securities, regardless of our actual operating performance, and could prevent our shareholders from selling their securities at or above the public offering price. In addition, the stock markets, from time to time, experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. These broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market prices of our securities, regardless of our trading performance.\nIn the past, shareholders often have brought securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may be the target of similar litigation in the future, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.", "PERMNO": 81564, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "IBKC"}
