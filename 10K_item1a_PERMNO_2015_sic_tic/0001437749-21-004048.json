RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in, incorporated by reference into or otherwise referred to in this annual report on Form 10-K, you should consider carefully the following factors when evaluating our business. Any of these risks, or the occurrence of any of the events described in these risk factors, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and the results of operations. In addition, other risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently do not deem material could arise, any of which could also materially adversely affect us. This annual report on Form 10-K also contains and incorporates by reference forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the occurrence of one or more of the following risk factors.\nRisksRelated to Our Indebtedness\nWe have substantial debt and have the ability to incur significant additional debt. The principal and interest payment obligations on such debt may restrict our future operations and impair our ability to meet our long-term obligations.\nCurrently we have approximately $4.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness, excluding intercompany debt and deferred financing costs. Subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions under our senior credit facility (the \u201c2019 Senior Credit Facility\u201d), we have the ability to incur significant additional debt, including secured debt under our un-drawn $200 million revolving credit facility. The terms of the indenture (the \u201c2030 Notes Indenture\u201d) governing our outstanding 4.750% senior notes due 2030 (the \u201c2030 Notes\u201d), the indenture (the \u201c2027 Notes Indenture\u201d) governing our outstanding 7.0% senior notes due 2027 (the \u201c2027 Notes\u201d) and the indenture (the \u201c2026 Notes Indenture\u201d) governing our outstanding 5.875% senior notes due 2026 (the \u201c2026 Notes\u201d) also permit us to incur additional indebtedness, subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions.\nOur substantial debt may have important consequences. For instance, it could:\n\u25cf require us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt, which would reduce funds available for other business purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions;\n\u25cf place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors that may have less debt and better access to capital resources;\n\u25cf limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes; and\n\u25cf make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations.\nOur ability to service our significant financial obligations depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow. This is partially subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, that future borrowings will be available to us under our 2019 Senior Credit Facility or any other credit facilities, or that we will be able to complete any necessary financings, in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our operations or pay our debts and other obligations, or to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, at times or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Specifically, volatility in the capital markets may also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, or to refinance our existing debt, on terms or at times favorable to us. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to service our debt or other obligations, which could result in us being in default thereon, in which circumstances our lenders could cease making loans to us, and lenders or other holders of our debt could accelerate and declare due all outstanding obligations due under the respective agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe agreements governing our various debt obligations impose restrictions on our operations and limit our ability to undertake certain corporate actions.\nThe agreements governing our various debt obligations, including our 2019 Senior Credit Facility, the 2030 Notes Indenture, the 2027 Notes Indenture and the 2026 Notes Indenture (together, the \u201cexisting indentures\u201d or the \u201cindentures\u201d), include covenants imposing significant restrictions on our operations. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. These covenants place, or will place, restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf\nincur additional debt, subject to certain limitations;\n\u25cf\ndeclare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders;\n\u25cf\nmake investments or acquisitions;\n\u25cf\ncreate liens or use assets as security in other transactions;\n\u25cf\nissue guarantees;\n\u25cf\nmerge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets;\n\u25cf\namend our articles of incorporation or bylaws;\n\u25cf\nengage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u25cf\npurchase, sell or transfer certain assets.\nAny of these restrictions and limitations could make it more difficult for us to execute our business strategy.\nThe existing indentures and our 2019 Senior Credit Facility require us to comply with certain financial ratios or other covenants; our failure to do so would result in a default thereunder, which would have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are required to comply with certain financial or other covenants under the existing indentures and our 2019 Senior Credit Facility. Our ability to comply with these requirements may be affected by events affecting our business, but beyond our control, including prevailing general economic, financial and industry conditions. These covenants could have an adverse effect on us by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, investment, acquisition or other corporate opportunities. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the existing indentures or our 2019 Senior Credit Facility.\nUpon a default under any of our debt agreements, the lenders or debtholders thereunder could have the right to declare all amounts outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable, which could, in turn, trigger defaults under other debt obligations and could result in the termination of commitments of the lenders to make further extensions of credit under our 2019 Senior Credit Facility. If we were unable to repay our secured debt to our lenders, or were otherwise in default under any provision governing our outstanding secured debt obligations, our secured lenders could proceed against us and our subsidiary guarantors and against the collateral securing that debt. Any default resulting in an acceleration of outstanding indebtedness, a termination of commitments under our financing arrangements or lenders proceeding against the collateral securing such indebtedness would likely result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our 2019 Senior Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If the rates on which our borrowings are based were to increase from current levels, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available to service our other obligations would decrease.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOperating Risks\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. We expect the COVID-19 global pandemic to have a material adverse impact on our business including our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on our business, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; the negative impact it has on global and regional economies and economic activity; changes in advertising customers and consumer behavior; impact of governmental regulations that might be imposed in response to the pandemic, its short and longer-term impact on the levels of consumer confidence; actions governments, businesses and individuals take in response to the pandemic; and how quickly economies recover after the COVID-19 global pandemic subsides. Although we have continued to operate our facilities to date and have taken precautions, consistent with federal guidelines and state and local orders, to protect the safety and well-being of our employees, customers and the general public, the COVID-19 global pandemic and any preventive or protective actions taken by governmental authorities have had and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our workforce and operations. In addition, we may become party to lawsuits related to the risk of exposure to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has had, and will continue to have, a widespread and broad reaching effect on the economy and could have adverse impacts on our clients, which has resulted and could continue to result in a decrease in advertising spend and/or heighten the risk with respect to the collectability of our receivables. Additionally, as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic, we have experienced a disruption in creation of content that we broadcast on our television stations and of events and programs we produce at our production companies, including the cancellation of certain sports events and the shutting down of production of certain television content.\nConsumer spending and changes in advertising generally may also be negatively impacted by general macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence, including the impacts of any recession, resulting from the COVID-19 global pandemic. This may negatively impact revenues. In addition, disruption of global financial markets as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on our business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as information is rapidly evolving with respect to the duration and severity of the pandemic and the resulting effects on local, national and global economies. At this point, we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of the COVID-19 global pandemic, or its overall impact on our business. Even after the COVID-19 global pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future. The effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic may also impact financial markets and corporate credit markets which could adversely impact our access to financing or the terms of any such financing. Any of these events could exacerbate the other risks and uncertainties described herein, or in other reports filed with the SEC from time to time, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price.\nThe success of our business is dependent upon advertising revenues, which are seasonal and cyclical, and also fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur main source of revenue is the sale of advertising time and space. Our ability to sell advertising time and space depends on, among other things:\n\u25cf\neconomic conditions in the areas where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole;\n\u25cf\nthe popularity of the programming offered by our television stations;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the population demographics in the areas where our stations are located;\n\u25cf local and national advertising price fluctuations, which can be affected by the availability of programming, the popularity of programming, and the relative supply of and demand for commercial advertising;\n\u25cf our competitors\u2019 activities, including increased competition from other advertising-based mediums, particularly digital platforms, cable networks, MVPDs and other internet companies;\n\u25cf the duration and extent of any network preemption of regularly scheduled programming for any reason;\n\u25cf\ndecisions by advertisers to withdraw or delay planned advertising expenditures for any reason;\n\u25cf labor disputes or other disruptions at major national advertisers, programming providers or networks; and\n\u25cf\nother factors beyond our control.\nOur results are also subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations. Seasonal fluctuations typically result in higher revenue and broadcast operating income in the second and fourth quarters rather than in the first and third quarters of each year. This seasonality is primarily attributable to advertisers\u2019 increased expenditures in the spring and in anticipation of holiday season spending in the fourth quarter and an increase in television viewership during these periods. In addition, we typically experience fluctuations in our revenue and broadcast operating income between even-numbered and odd-numbered years. In years in which there are impending elections for various state and national offices, which primarily occur in even-numbered years, political advertising revenue tends to increase, often significantly, and particularly during presidential election years. We consider political broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned from the sale of advertising to political candidates, political parties and special interest groups of advertisements broadcast by our stations that contain messages primarily focused on elections and/or public policy issues. In even-numbered years, we typically derive a material portion of our broadcast advertising revenue from political broadcast advertisers. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we derived approximately 18% and 3%, respectively, of our total revenue from political broadcast advertisers. If political broadcast advertising revenues declined, especially in an even-numbered year, our results of operations and financial condition could also be materially adversely affected. Also, our stations affiliated with the NBC Network broadcast Olympic Games and typically experience increased viewership and revenue during those broadcasts. As a result of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenue and broadcast operating income, and the historically significant increase in our revenue and broadcast operating income during even-numbered years, it has been, and is expected to remain, difficult to engage in period-over-period comparisons of our revenue and results of operations.\nContinued uncertain financial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nFinancial and economic conditions continue to be uncertain over the longer term and the continuation or worsening of such conditions could reduce consumer confidence and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. If consumer confidence were to decline, this decline could negatively affect our advertising customers\u2019 businesses and their advertising budgets. In addition, volatile economic conditions could have a negative impact on our industry or the industries of our customers who advertise on our stations, resulting in reduced advertising sales. Furthermore, it may be possible that actions taken by any governmental or regulatory body for the purpose of stabilizing the economy or financial markets will not achieve their intended effect. In addition to any negative direct consequences to our business or results of operations arising from these financial and economic developments, some of these actions may adversely affect financial institutions, capital providers, advertisers or other consumers on whom we rely, including for access to future capital or financing arrangements necessary to support our business. Our inability to obtain financing in amounts and at times necessary could make it more difficult or impossible to meet our obligations or otherwise take actions in our best interests.\nOur dependence upon a limited number of advertising categories could adversely affect our business.\nWe consider broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned primarily from the sale of advertisements broadcast by our stations. Although no single customer represented more than 5% of our broadcast advertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019, we derived a material portion of non-political broadcast advertising revenue from advertisers in a limited number of industries, particularly the automotive industry. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 we derived approximately 21% and 25%, respectively, of our total broadcast advertising revenue from our advertisers in the automotive industry. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if broadcast advertising revenue from the automotive, or certain other industries, such as the medical, restaurant, communications, or furniture and appliances industries, declined.\nWe intend to continue to evaluate growth opportunities through strategic acquisitions, and there are significant risks associated with an acquisition strategy.\nWe intend to continue to evaluate opportunities for growth through selective acquisitions of television stations or station groups. There can be no assurances that we will be able to identify any suitable acquisition candidates, and we cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing or completing any acquisitions, or what the consequences of not completing any acquisitions would be. Consummation of any proposed acquisition at any time may also be subject to various conditions such as compliance with FCC rules and policies. Consummation of acquisitions may also be subject to antitrust or other regulatory requirements. In addition, as we operate in a highly regulated industry, we could be subject to litigation, government investigations and enforcement actions on a variety of matters, the result of which could limit our acquisition strategy.\nAn acquisition strategy involves numerous other risks, including risks associated with:\n\u25cf identifying suitable acquisition candidates and negotiating definitive purchase agreements on satisfactory terms;\n\u25cf integrating operations and systems and managing a large and geographically diverse group of stations;\n\u25cf\nobtaining financing to complete acquisitions, which financing may not be available to us at times, in amounts, or at rates acceptable to us, if at all, and potentially the related risks associated with increased debt;\n\u25cf\ndiverting our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u25cf\npotentially losing key employees; and\n\u25cf\npotential changes in the regulatory approval process that may make it materially more expensive, or materially delay our ability, to consummate any proposed acquisitions.\nOur failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates, or to complete any acquisitions and integrate any acquired business, or to obtain the expected benefits therefrom, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may fail to realize any benefits and incur unanticipated losses related to any acquisition.\nThe success of any strategic acquisition depends, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the acquired business and assets with our business and our ability to successfully manage the assets so acquired. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition. Successful integration may also be hampered by any differences between the operations and corporate culture of the two organizations. Additionally, general market and economic conditions may inhibit our successful integration of any business. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of an acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Finally, any cost savings that are realized may be offset by losses in revenues from the acquired business, any assets or operations disposed of in connection therewith or otherwise, or charges to earnings in connection with such acquisitions.\nWe must purchase television programming in advance of knowing whether a particular show will be popular enough for us to recoup our costs.\nOne of our most significant costs is for the purchase of television programming. If a particular program is not sufficiently popular among audiences in relation to the cost we pay for such program, we may not be able to sell enough related advertising time for us to recover the costs we pay to broadcast the program. We are frequently required to purchase programming several years in advance, and we may have to commit to purchase more than one year\u2019s worth of programming, resulting in the incurrence of significant costs in advance of our receipt of any related revenue. We may also replace programs that are performing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion of the costs we incurred in obtaining such programming or fully expensed the costs for financial reporting purposes. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues, result in the incurrence of impairment charges or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues.\nWe are highly dependent upon our network affiliations, and our business and results of operations may be materially affected if a network: (i) terminates its affiliation with us; (ii) significantly changes the economic terms and conditions of any future affiliation agreements with us or; (iii) significantly changes the type, quality or quantity of programming provided to us under an affiliation agreement.\nOur business depends in large part on the success of our network affiliations. Nearly all of our stations are directly or indirectly affiliated with at least one of the four major broadcast networks pursuant to a separate affiliation agreement. Each affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the affiliated network during the term of the related agreement. Our affiliation agreements generally expire at various dates through December 2023.\nIf we cannot enter into affiliation agreements to replace any agreements in advance of their expiration, we would no longer be able to carry the affiliated network\u2019s programming. This loss of programming would require us to seek to obtain replacement programming. Such replacement programming may involve higher costs and may not be as attractive to our target audiences, thereby reducing our ability to generate advertising revenue. Furthermore, our concentration of CBS and/or NBC affiliates makes us particularly sensitive to adverse changes in our business relationship with, and the general success of, CBS and/or NBC.\nWe can give no assurance that any future affiliation agreements will have economic terms or conditions equivalent to or more advantageous to us than our current agreements. If in the future a network or networks impose more adverse economic terms upon us, such event or events could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, if we are unable to renew or replace any existing affiliation agreements, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations under our existing or any future retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs and/or secure payment of retransmission consent fees under such agreements. Furthermore, if in the future a network limited or removed our ability to retransmit network programming to MVPDs, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations or criteria for fees under any existing or any future retransmission consent agreements. In either case, such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are also dependent upon our retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs, and we cannot predict the outcome of potential regulatory changes to the retransmission consent regime.\nWe are also dependent, in significant part, on our retransmission consent agreements. Our current retransmission consent agreements expire at various times over the next several years. No assurances can be provided that we will be able to renegotiate all of such agreements on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. The failure to renegotiate such agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur ability to successfully negotiate future retransmission consent agreements may be hindered by potential legislative or regulatory charges to the framework under which these agreements are negotiated.\nThe FCC has taken actions to implement various provisions of STELAR affecting the carriage of television stations, including (i) adopting rules that allow for the modification of satellite television markets in order to ensure that satellite operators carry the broadcast stations of most interest to their communities; (ii) tightening its rules on joint retransmission consent negotiations to prohibit joint negotiations by stations in the same market unless those stations are commonly controlled; (iii) prohibiting a television station from limiting the ability of an MVPD to carry into its local market television signals that are deemed significantly viewed; and (iv) eliminating the \u201csweeps prohibition,\u201d which had precluded cable operators from deleting or repositioning local commercial television stations during \u201csweeps\u201d ratings periods.\nWe currently are not a party to any agreements that delegate our authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any of our television stations or grant us authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any other television station. Nevertheless, we cannot predict how the FCC\u2019s restrictions on joint negotiations might impact future opportunities.\nThe FCC also has sought comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. If, however, the FCC eliminates or relaxes its rules enforcing our program exclusivity rights, it could affect our ability to negotiate future retransmission consent agreements, and it could harm our ratings and advertising revenue if cable and satellite operators import duplicative programming.\nIn addition, certain OVDs have explored streaming broadcast programming over the internet without approval from or payments to the broadcaster. The majority of federal courts have issued preliminary injunctions enjoining these OVDs from streaming broadcast programming. Recently, a new OVD, organized as a non-profit began operating, claiming that its operations are exempt from copyright liability because of its non-profit status. In July 2019, the major broadcast networks and certain affiliated entities filed a copyright lawsuit against this OVD. The OVD continues to operate while the lawsuit is pending. We cannot predict the outcome of this lawsuit. Separately, on December 19, 2014, the FCC issued an NPRM proposing to classify certain OVDs as MVPDs for purposes of certain FCC carriage rules. If the FCC adopts its proposal, OVDs would need to negotiate for consent from broadcasters before they retransmit broadcast signals. We cannot predict whether the FCC will adopt its proposal or other modified rules that might weaken our rights to negotiate with OVDs.\nIn December 2019, Congress adopted the Satellite Television Community Protection and Promotion Act of 2019 and the TVPA of 2019. Among other things, these acts (i) made permanent the copyright license set out in Section 119 of the Copyright Act; (ii) limited eligibility for use of the Section 119 license to retransmit the signals of network television broadcast stations to unserved households to those satellite operators who provide local-into-local service to all DMAs; and (iii) modified the definition of unserved households to those households located in a \u201cshort market\u201d (which, in turn, was defined as a local market in which programming of one or more of the top four networks is not offered on either the primary or multicast stream by any network station in that market). The TVPA of 2019 also made permanent the requirement that broadcasters and MVPDs negotiate in good faith and adds a provision that will (i) allow MVPDs to designate a buying group to negotiate retransmission consent agreements on their behalf and (ii) require large stations groups, including ours, to negotiate in good faith with a qualified MVPD buying group.\nCongress continues to consider various changes to the statutory scheme governing retransmission of broadcast programming. Some of the proposed bills would make it more difficult to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with large MVPDs and would weaken our leverage to seek market-based compensation for our programming. We cannot predict whether any of these proposals will become law, and, if any do, we cannot determine the effect that any statutory changes would have on our business.\nWe may be unable to maintain or increase our digital advertising revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe generate a portion of our advertising revenue from the sale of advertisements on our digital sites. Our ability to maintain and increase this advertising revenue is largely dependent upon the number of users actively visiting our internet sites and using our digital apps. As a result, we must increase user engagement with our internet sites in order to increase our advertising revenue. Because digital advertising techniques are evolving, if our content, technology and advertisement serving techniques do not evolve to meet the changing needs of advertisers, our advertising revenue could also decline. Changes in our business model, advertising inventory or initiatives could also cause a decrease in our internet advertising revenue.\nWe do not have long-term agreements with most of our digital advertisers. Any termination, change or decrease in our relationships with our largest digital advertising clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. If we do not maintain or increase our digital advertising revenue, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nCybersecurity risks could affect our operating effectiveness.\nWe use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. Our revenues are increasingly dependent on digital products. Such use exposes us to potential cyber incidents resulting from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents could include, but are not limited to, unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, data corruption or operational disruption. The results of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, business interruption, disclosure of nonpublic information, decreased advertising revenues, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation, financial consequences and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence, any or all of which could adversely affect our business. Although we have systems and processes in place to protect against risks associated with cyber incidents, depending on the nature of an incident, these protections may not be fully sufficient.\nIndustry Risks\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. Competition occurs on multiple levels (for audiences, programming and advertisers) and is based on a variety of factors. If we are not able to successfully compete in all relevant aspects, our revenues will be materially adversely affected.\nTelevision stations compete for audiences, certain programming (including news) and advertisers. Signal coverage and carriage on MVPD systems also materially affect a television station\u2019s competitive position. With respect to audiences, stations compete primarily based on broadcast program popularity. We cannot provide any assurances as to the acceptability by audiences of any of the programs we broadcast. Further, because we compete with other broadcast stations for certain programming, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain any desired programming at costs that we believe are reasonable. Cable-network programming, combined with increased access to cable, satellite TV, and internet video streaming services, has become a significant competitor for broadcast television programming viewers. Cable networks\u2019 viewership and advertising share have increased due to the growth in MVPD and internet video streaming services, penetration (the percentage of television households that are connected to an MVPD or internet video system) and increased investments in programming by cable networks or internet video. Further increases in the advertising share of cable networks and internet video streaming services could materially adversely affect the advertising revenue of our television stations.\nIn addition, technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of programming alternatives, such as internet websites, mobile apps and wireless carriers, direct-to-consumer video distribution systems, and home entertainment systems have further fractionalized television viewing audiences and resulted in additional challenges to revenue generation. New technologies and methods of buying advertising also present an additional competitive challenge, as competitors may offer products and services such as the ability to purchase advertising programmatically or bundled offline and online advertising, aimed at more efficiently capturing advertising spend.\nOur inability or failure to broadcast popular programs, or otherwise maintain viewership for any reason, including as a result of increases in programming alternatives, or our loss of advertising due to technological changes, could result in a lack of advertisers, or a reduction in the amount advertisers are willing to pay us to advertise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOther Financial Risks\nWe have, in the past, incurred impairment charges on our goodwill and/or broadcast licenses, and any such future charges may have a material effect on the value of our total assets.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the book value of our broadcast licenses was $3.6 billion and the book value of our goodwill was $1.5 billion, in comparison to total assets of $7.6 billion. Not less than annually, and more frequently if necessary, we are required to evaluate our goodwill and broadcast licenses to determine if the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value. If the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value, we will be required to record a non-cash expense to write down the book value of the intangible asset to the estimated fair value. We cannot make any assurances that any required impairment charges will not have a material adverse effect on our total assets.\nRecently enacted changes to the United States tax laws may have a material impact on our business or financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, United States tax reform legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTCJA\u201d) was signed into law. The TCJA made substantial changes to United States tax law, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate, a limitation on deductibility of interest expense, a limitation on the use of net operating losses to offset future taxable income and the allowance of immediate expensing of capital expenditures. The TCJA will continue to have significant effects on us, some of which may be adverse. The extent of the impact remains uncertain at this time and is subject to any other regulatory or administrative developments, including any further regulations or other guidance yet to be promulgated by the United States Internal Revenue Service. The TCJA contains numerous, complex provisions that could affect us.\nWe are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations and we depend on our subsidiaries for cash.\nWe are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations, other than our investments in our subsidiaries. Because we are a holding company, we are dependent upon the payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. These payments could be or become subject to dividend or other restrictions under applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. Payments by our subsidiaries are also contingent upon the subsidiaries\u2019 earnings. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our financial condition and ability to meet our obligations may be adversely affected.\nOur defined benefit pension plan obligation is currently underfunded, and, if certain factors worsen, we may have to make significant cash payments, which could reduce the cash available for our business.\nWe have underfunded obligations under our defined benefit pension plan. Notwithstanding that our pension plan is frozen with regard to any future benefit accruals, the funded status of our pension plan is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of certain market interest rates and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations. Unfavorable returns on the plan\u2019s assets or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations may materially change the timing and amount of required plan funding, which could reduce the cash available for our business. In addition, any future decreases in the discount rate used to determine pension obligations could result in an increase in the valuation of pension obligations, which could affect the reported funding status of our pension plan and future contributions.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nFederal broadcasting industry regulations limit our operating flexibility.\nThe FCC regulates all television broadcasters, including us. We must obtain FCC approval whenever we (i) apply for a new license; (ii) seek to renew, modify or assign a license; (iii) purchase a broadcast station; and/or (iv) transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries that holds a license. Our FCC licenses are critical to our operations, and we cannot operate without them. We cannot be certain that the FCC will renew these licenses in the future or approve new acquisitions, mergers, divestitures or other business activities. Our failure to renew any licenses upon the expiration of any license term could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFederal legislation and FCC rules have changed significantly in recent years and may continue to change. These changes may limit our ability to conduct our business in ways that we believe would be advantageous and may affect our operating results.\nThe FCC can sanction us for programming broadcast on our stations that it finds to be indecent.\nOver the past several years, the FCC has increased its enforcement efforts regarding broadcast indecency and profanity and the statutory maximum fine for broadcasting indecent material is currently $414,454 per incident. In June 2012, the Supreme Court decided a challenge to the FCC\u2019s indecency enforcement policies without resolving the scope of the FCC\u2019s ability to regulate broadcast content. In August 2013, the FCC issued a Public Notice seeking comment on whether it should modify its indecency policies. The FCC has not yet issued a decision in this proceeding and the courts remain free to review the FCC\u2019s current policy or any modifications thereto. The outcomes of these proceedings could affect future FCC policies in this area, and we are unable to predict the outcome of any such judicial proceeding, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe FCC\u2019s duopoly restrictions limit our ability to own and operate multiple television stations in the same market.\nThe FCC\u2019s ownership rules generally prohibit us from owning or having \u201cattributable interests\u201d in two television stations that are located in the same market when one of the stations is ranked among the top-four stations in the market unless eight independently owned, full-power stations will remain in the market. In November 2017, the FCC released an order that eliminated or relaxed several long-standing media ownership rules. However, in November 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated these rule changes and reinstated the prior, more restrictive, ownership rules. The Supreme Court of the United States granted the FCC\u2019s petition for certiorari seeking review of the Third Circuit decision. The case was argued before the Supreme Court on January 19, 2021. In December 2018, the FCC launched a new proceeding to consider whether further changes in the media ownership rules were necessary. The FCC also considers television Local Marketing Agreements (\u201cLMAs\u201d) (which are agreements under which a television station sells or provides more than 15% of the programming on another same-market television station) as \u201cattributable interests.\u201d With the previous ownership rules in effect, our ability to expand in our present markets through additional station acquisitions or LMAs may be constrained.\nThe FCC\u2019s National Television Station Ownership Rule limits the maximum number of households we can reach.\nUnder the FCC\u2019s National Television Station Ownership Rule, a single television station owner may not reach more than 39% of United States households through commonly owned television stations, subject to a 50% discount of the number of television households attributable to UHF stations (the \u201cUHF Discount\u201d). In December 2017, the FCC issued an NPRM seeking comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the national cap, including the UHF Discount. This rule may constrain our ability to expand through additional station acquisitions. Currently our station portfolio reaches approximately 24% of total United States television households, or approximately 17% of total United States television households, after applying the UHF discount.\nThe Company is subject to governmental oversight regarding compliance with antitrust law as well as related civil litigation.\nVarious governmental agencies, including the DOJ, have authority to enforce the antitrust laws of the United States in the broadcast television industry. The DOJ has increased its enforcement activities within the industry. For example, in November 2018, the DOJ filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against six broadcasters, including Raycom, alleging an agreement to exchange competitively sensitive information. The broadcasters and the DOJ entered into a settlement agreement, which, among other things, prohibits the defendant broadcasters from exchanging competitively sensitive information and impose certain compliance requirements. No party to the settlement agreement, including Raycom, admitted to any wrongdoing. In addition, following the public disclosure of the DOJ\u2019s investigation, several putative class action lawsuits were filed against various broadcasters, including Gray, asserting claims related to those reflected in the DOJ settlement. These lawsuits have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois for the purpose of coordinated and consolidated pretrial proceedings. We are unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Equity Securities\nThe price and trading volume of our equity securities may be volatile.\nThe price and trading volume of our equity securities may be volatile and subject to fluctuations. Some of the factors that could cause fluctuation in the stock price or trading volume of our equity securities include:\n\u25cf\ngeneral market and economic conditions and market trends, including in the television broadcast industry and the financial markets generally;\n\u25cf\nthe political, economic and social situation in the United States;\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated variations in operating results, including audience share ratings and financial results;\n\u25cf\ninability to meet projections in revenue;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments or other business developments;\n\u25cf\ntechnological innovations in the television broadcast industry;\n\u25cf\nadoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;\n\u25cf\noperations of competitors and the performance of competitors\u2019 common stock;\n\u25cf\nlitigation or governmental action involving or affecting us or our subsidiaries;\n\u25cf\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf\npurchases or sales of blocks of our common stock; and\n\u25cf\noperating and stock performance of the companies that investors may consider to be comparable.\nThere can be no assurance that the price of our equity securities will not fluctuate or decline significantly. The stock market in recent years has experienced considerable price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies and that could adversely affect the price of our equity securities, regardless of our operating performance. Stock price volatility might be worse if the trading volume of shares of our equity securities is low. Furthermore, stockholders may initiate securities class action lawsuits if the market price of our equity securities were to decline significantly, which may cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management.\nWe do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock or Class A common stock. To the extent a potential investor ascribes value to a dividend paying stock, the value of our stock may be correspondingly reduced.\nOur Board of Directors has not declared a cash or stock dividend on either class of our common stock since 2008. The timing and amount of any future dividend is at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and they may be subject to limitations or restrictions in our 2019 Senior Credit Facility and other financing agreements we may be, or become, party to. We can provide no assurance when or if any future dividends will be declared on our common stock or Class A common stock. As a result, if and to the extent an investor ascribes value to a dividend paying stock, the value of our common stock or Class A common stock may be correspondingly reduced.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our Restated Articles of Incorporation (\u201cArticles\u201d) and our Bylaws, as amended (\u201cBylaws\u201d), as well as provisions of Georgia law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur Articles and Bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging a prospective acquirer from making a tender offer for our shares of common stock or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. To the extent that these provisions discourage takeover attempts, they could deprive stockholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares. Moreover, these provisions could discourage accumulations of large blocks of common stock, thus depriving stockholders of any advantages which large accumulations of stock might provide.\nAs a Georgia corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Georgia law, including Section 14-2-1132 of the Georgia Business Corporation Code. Section 14-2-1132 prevents some stockholders holding more than 10% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations unless the business combination was approved in advance by our Board of Directors or results in the stockholder holding more than 90% of our outstanding common stock.\nAny provision of our Articles, our Bylaws or Georgia law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nWe have the ability to issue additional preferred stock, which could affect the rights of holders of our common stock and Class A common stock.\nIncluding the shares of preferred stock issued in the Raycom Merger, our Articles allow our Board of Directors to issue up to 20 million shares of preferred stock and set forth the terms of such preferred stock. The terms of any such preferred stock, if issued, may adversely affect the dividend and liquidation rights of holders of our common stock.\nHolders of our Class A common stock have the right to 10 votes per share on all matters to be voted on by our stockholders and, consequently, the ability to exert significant influence over us.\nAs a result of the 10 to 1 voting rights of holders of our Class A common stock, these stockholders are expected to be able to exert significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including mergers and other material transactions, and may be able to cause or prevent a change in the composition of our Board of Directors or a change in control of our Company that could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the Company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\nCertain stockholders or groups of stockholders have the ability to exert significant influence over us.\nHilton H. Howell, Jr., our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is the husband of Robin R. Howell, a member of our Board of Directors (collectively with other members of their family, the \u201cHowell-Robinson Family\u201d). As a result of their significant stockholdings and positions on the Board of Directors, the Howell-Robinson Family is able to exert significant influence over our policies and management, potentially in a manner which may not be consistent with the interests of our other stockholders.", "PERMNO": 83989, "SIC": 4833, "TIC": "GTN"}
