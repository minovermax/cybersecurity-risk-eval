You should carefully consider the risk factors described below, together with the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before you decide to invest in our securities. The risks described below are the material risks of which we are currently aware; however, they may not be the only risks that we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also impair our business. If any of these risks develop into actual events, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and the trading price of your shares could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nChanges in current environmental legislation could have an adverse impact on the sale of our environmental control systems and products and on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is primarily driven by capital spending, clean air rules, plant upgrades by our customers to comply with laws and regulations governing the discharge of pollutants into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment or human health. These laws include, but not limited to, U.S. federal statutes such as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Air Interstate Rule, and the regulations implementing these statutes, as well as similar laws and regulations at state and local levels and in other countries. These U.S. laws and regulations may change and other countries may not adopt similar laws and regulations. Our business may be adversely impacted to the extent that environmental regulations are repealed, amended, implementation dates delayed, or to the extent that regulatory authorities reduce enforcement.\nOur dependence upon fixed-price contracts could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe majority of our projects are currently performed on a fixed-price basis. Under a fixed-price contract, we agree on the price that we will receive for the entire project, based upon a defined scope, which includes specific assumptions and project criteria. If our estimates of our own costs to complete the project are below the actual costs that we incur, our margins will decrease, and we may incur a loss. The revenue, cost and gross profit realized on a fixed-price contract will often vary from the estimated amounts because of unforeseen conditions or changes in job conditions and variations in labor and equipment productivity over the term of the contract. If we are unsuccessful in mitigating these risks, we may realize gross profits that are different from those originally estimated and incur reduced profitability or losses on projects. Depending on the size of a project, these variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant effect on our operating results. In general, turnkey contracts to be performed on a fixed-price basis involve an increased risk of significant variations. This is a result of the long-term nature of these contracts and the inherent difficulties in estimating costs and of the interrelationship of the integrated services to be provided under these contracts whereby unanticipated costs or delays in performing part of the contract can have compounding effects by increasing costs of performing other parts of the contract.\nPercentage-of-completion method of accounting for contract revenue may result in material adjustments that would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe recognize contract revenue for a substantial component of our business using the percentage-of-completion method on fixed price contracts. Under this method, for each contract, estimated contract revenue is calculated based generally on the percentage that actual direct costs to date are to total estimated direct costs. Estimated contract losses are recognized in full when determined. Accordingly, contract revenue and total direct cost estimates are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses and as change orders are approved, and adjustments based upon the percentage-of-completion are reflected in contract revenue in the period when these estimates are revised. These estimates are based on management\u2019s reasonable assumptions and our historical experience, and are only estimates. Variation of actual results from these assumptions, which are outside the control of management and can differ from our historical experience, could be material. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, a reduction or the elimination of previously reported contract revenue, we would recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material.\nWe have recently made and may make future acquisitions, which involve numerous risks that could impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operating strategy involves expanding our scope of products and services through selective acquisitions and the formation of new business units that are then integrated into our growing family of turnkey system providers. We have acquired, and may selectively acquire, other businesses, product or service lines, assets or technologies that are complementary to our business. We may be unable to find or consummate future acquisitions at acceptable prices and terms. We continually evaluate potential acquisition opportunities in the ordinary course of business. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including among others:\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in integrating the acquired businesses, product or service lines, assets or technologies;\n\u00b7\ndiverting management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of the business;\n\u00b7\nentering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated costs and exposure to undisclosed or unforeseen liabilities;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to service debt obligations incurred in connection with such acquisitions, if any;\n\u00b7\npotential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired businesses, product or service lines, assets or technologies;\n\u00b7\nour ability to properly establish and maintain effective internal controls over an acquired company; and\n\u00b7\nincreasing demands on our operational and information technology systems.\nAlthough we conduct what we believe to be a prudent level of investigation regarding the operating and financial condition of the businesses, product or service lines, assets or technologies we purchase, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding their actual operating and financial condition. Until we actually assume operating control of these businesses, product or service lines, assets or technologies, we may not be able to ascertain their actual value or understand potential liabilities. This is particularly true with respect to acquisitions outside the United States.\nIn addition, acquisitions of businesses may require additional debt or equity financing, resulting in additional leverage or dilution of ownership. Our credit agreement (\u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) contains certain covenants that limit, or which may have the effect of limiting, among other things, acquisitions, capital expenditures, the sale of assets and the incurrence of additional indebtedness.\nWe may incur material costs as a result of existing or future product liability claims, or other claims and litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; and our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or may be insufficient to cover the claims.\nDespite our quality assurance measures, we may be exposed to product liability claims, other claims and litigation in the event that the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage or our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected. While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability and other claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability and other claims. Any future damages that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, product liability and other claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome.\nAn unsuccessful defense of a product liability or other claim could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us.\nWe are party to asbestos-containing product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur subsidiary, Met-Pro, beginning in 2002, began to be named in asbestos-related lawsuits filed against a large number of industrial companies including, in particular, those in the pump and fluid handling industries. In management\u2019s opinion, the complaints typically have been vague, general and speculative, alleging that Met-Pro, along with the numerous other defendants, sold unidentified asbestos-containing products and engaged in other related actions that caused injuries (including death) and loss to the plaintiffs. Counsel has advised that more recent cases typically allege more serious claims of mesothelioma. The Company\u2019s insurers have hired attorneys who, together with the Company, are vigorously defending these cases. Many cases have been dismissed after the plaintiff fails to produce evidence of exposure to Met-Pro\u2019s products. In those cases where evidence has been produced, the\nCompany\u2019s experience has been that the exposure levels are low and the Company\u2019s position has been that its products were not a cause of death, injury or loss. The Company has been dismissed from or settled a large number of these cases. Cumulative settlement payments from 2002 through December 31, 2015 for cases involving asbestos-related claims were $0.9 million, which together with all legal fees other than corporate counsel expenses have been paid by the Company\u2019s insurers. The average cost per settled claim, excluding legal fees, was approximately $25,000.\nBased upon the most recent information available to the Company regarding such claims, there were a total of 221 cases pending against the Company as of December 31, 2015 (with Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia having the largest number of cases), as compared with 195 cases that were pending as of January 1, 2015. During 2015, 52 new cases were filed against the Company, and the Company was dismissed from 26 cases and settled zero cases. Most of the pending cases have not advanced beyond the early stages of discovery, although a number of cases are on schedules leading to, or are scheduled for trial. The Company believes that its insurance coverage is adequate for the cases currently pending against the Company and for the foreseeable future, assuming a continuation of the current volume, nature of cases and settlement amounts. However, the Company has no control over the number and nature of cases that are filed against it, nor as to the financial health of its insurers or their position as to coverage. The Company also presently believes that none of the pending cases will have a material adverse impact upon the Company\u2019s results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.\nOur business may be adversely affected by global economic conditions.\nA national or global economic downturn or credit crisis may have a significant negative impact on our financial condition, future results of operations and cash flows. Specific risk factors related to these overall economic and credit conditions include the following: customer or potential customers may reduce or delay their procurement or new product development; key suppliers may become insolvent resulting in delays for our material purchases; vendors and other third parties may fail to perform their contractual obligations; customers may be unable to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and services; and certain customers may become insolvent. These risk factors could reduce our product sales, increase our operating costs, impact our ability to collect customer receivables, lengthen our cash conversion cycle and increase our need for cash, which would ultimately decrease our profitability and negatively impact our financial condition. They could also limit our ability to expand through acquisitions due to the tightening of the credit markets.\nOur ability to obtain financing for future growth opportunities may be limited.\nOur ability to execute our growth strategies may be limited by our ability to secure and retain additional financing on terms reasonably acceptable to us or at all. Certain of our competitors are larger companies that may have greater access to capital, and therefore, may have a competitive advantage over us should our access to capital be limited.\nOur inability to deliver our backlog on time could affect our future sales and profitability, and our relationships with our customers.\nOur backlog has increased to $211.2 million at December 31, 2015 from $140.1 million at December 31, 2014. Our ability to meet customer delivery schedules for our backlog is dependent on a number of factors including, but not limited to, access to the raw materials required for production, an adequately trained and capable workforce, project engineering expertise for certain large projects, sufficient manufacturing plant capacity and appropriate planning and scheduling of manufacturing resources. Our failure to deliver in accordance with customer expectations may result in damage to existing customer relationships and result in the loss of future business. Failure to deliver backlog in accordance with expectations could negatively impact our financial performance and cause adverse changes in the market price of our common stock.\nOur financial performance may vary significantly from period to period, making it difficult to estimate future revenue.\nOur annual revenues and earnings have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future. Our contracts generally stipulate customer specific delivery terms and may have contract cycles of a year or more, which subjects these contracts to many factors beyond our control. In addition, contracts that are significantly larger in size than our typical contracts tend to intensify their impact on our annual operating results. Furthermore, as a significant portion of our operating costs are fixed, an unanticipated decrease in our revenues, a delay or cancellation of orders in backlog, or a decrease in the demand for our products, may have a significant impact on our annual operating results. Therefore, our annual operating results may be subject to significant variations and our operating performance in one period may not be indicative of our future performance.\nA significant portion of our accounts receivable are related to larger contracts, which increases our exposure to credit risk.\nWe closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers. Significant portions of our sales are to customers who place large orders for custom products and whose activities are related to the power and oil/gas industries. As a result, our exposure to credit risk is affected to some degree by conditions within these industries and governmental and/or political conditions. We frequently attempt to reduce our exposure to credit risk by requiring progress payments and letters of credit. However, the continuing economic climate and other unanticipated events that affect our customers could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results.\nOur operations outside of the United States are subject to political, investment and local business risks.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 38% of our total revenue was derived from products or services ultimately delivered or provided to end-users outside the United States. As part of our operating strategy, we intend to expand our international operations through internal growth and selected acquisitions. Our goal is to balance revenues 50/50 between the United States and the rest of the world. Operations outside of the United States, particularly in emerging markets, are subject to a variety of risks that are different from or are in addition to the risks we face within the United States. Among others, these risks include:\n\u00b7\nlocal, economic, political and social conditions, including potential hyperinflationary conditions and political instability in certain countries;\n\u00b7\nimposition of limitations on the remittance of dividends and payments by foreign subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\nadverse currency exchange rate fluctuations, including significant devaluations of currencies;\n\u00b7\ntax-related risks, including the imposition of taxes and the lack of beneficial treaties, that result in higher effective tax rates for us;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign local systems;\n\u00b7\ndomestic and foreign customs, tariffs and quotas or other trade barriers;\n\u00b7\nincreased costs for transportation and shipping;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in protecting intellectual property;\n\u00b7\nrisk of nationalization of private enterprises by foreign governments;\n\u00b7\nmanaging and obtaining support and distribution channels for overseas operations;\n\u00b7\nhiring and retaining qualified management personnel for our overseas operations;\n\u00b7\nlegal and regulatory requirements, including import, export, defense regulations and foreign exchange controls;\n\u00b7\nimposition or increase of restrictions on investment;\n\u00b7\ndisadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to United States laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d); and\n\u00b7\nrequired compliance with a variety of local laws and regulations, which may differ materially from those to which we are subject in the United States.\nIn addition, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws as well as export controls and economic sanction laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA, export control or sanction violations, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, including loss of export privileges or authorization needed to conduct aspects of our international business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe occurrence of one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our international operations or upon our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in billing terms can increase our exposure to working capital and credit risk.\nOur products are generally sold under contracts that allow us to bill upon the completion of certain agreed upon milestones or upon actual shipment of the product, and certain contracts include a retention provision. We attempt to negotiate progress-billing milestones on all large contracts to help us manage the working capital and credit risk associated with these large contracts. Consequently, shifts in the billing terms of the contracts in our backlog from period to period can increase our requirement for working capital and can increase our exposure to credit risk.\nCustomers may cancel or delay projects. As a result, our backlog may not be indicative of our future revenue.\nCustomers may cancel or delay projects for reasons beyond our control. Our orders normally contain cancellation provisions that permit us to recover our costs, and, for most contracts, a portion of our anticipated profit in the event a customer cancels an order. If a customer elects to cancel an order, we may not realize the full amount of revenues included in our backlog. If projects are delayed, the timing of our revenues could be affected and projects may remain in our backlog for extended periods of time. Revenue recognition occurs over long periods of time and is subject to unanticipated delays. If we receive relatively large orders in any given quarter, fluctuations in the levels of our quarterly backlog can result because the backlog in that quarter may reach levels that may not be sustained in subsequent quarters. As a result, our backlog may not be indicative of our future revenues. With rare exceptions, we are not issued contracts until a customer is ready to start work on a project. Thus, it is our experience that the only relation between the length of a project and the possibility that a project may be cancelled is simply the fact that there is more time involved. In a year-long as opposed to a three-month project more time is available for the customer to experience a softening in their business, which may cause the customer to cancel a project.\nOur gross margins are affected by shifts in our product mix.\nCertain of our products have higher gross profit margins than others. Consequently, changes in the product mix of our sales from quarter-to-quarter or from year-to-year can have a significant impact on our reported gross profit margins. Certain of our products also have a much higher internally manufactured cost component. Therefore, changes from quarter-to-quarter or from year-to-year can have a significant impact on our reported gross margins. In addition, contracts with a higher percentage of subcontracted work or equipment purchases may result in lower gross profit margins.\nIf our goodwill or intangibles become impaired, we may be required to recognize charges that would reduce our net income or increase our net loss.\nAs of December 31, 2015, goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles represented $246.5 million, or 41.1% of our total assets. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead are subject to annual impairment evaluations (or more frequently if circumstances require). Major factors that influence our evaluations are our estimates for future revenue and expenses associated with the specific intangible asset or the reporting unit in which our goodwill resides. This is the most sensitive of our estimates related to our evaluations. Other factors considered in our evaluations include assumptions as to the business climate, industry and economic conditions. These assumptions are subjective and different estimates could have a significant impact on the results of our analyses. While management, based on current forecasts and outlooks, believes that the assumptions and estimates are reasonable, we can make no assurances that future actual operating results will be realized as planned and that there will not be material impairment charges as a result. In particular, an economic downturn could have a material adverse impact on our customers thereby forcing them to reduce or curtail doing business with us and such a result may materially affect the amount of cash flow generated by our future operations. Any write-down of goodwill or intangible assets resulting from future periodic evaluations would, as applicable, either decrease our net income or increase our net loss and those decreases or increases could be material.\nWe face significant competition in the markets we serve.\nThe industries in which we compete are all highly competitive and highly fragmented. We compete against a number of local, regional and national contractors and manufacturers in each of our product or service lines, many of which have been in existence longer than us and some of which have substantially greater financial resources than we do. Our products primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, speed of delivery, quality, customer support and single source. Any failure by us to compete effectively in the markets we serve could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreasing costs for manufactured components, raw materials, transportation, health care and energy prices may adversely affect our profitability.\nWe use a broad range of manufactured components and raw materials in our products, including raw steel, steel-related components, filtration media, and equipment such as fans and motors. Materials and subcontracting costs comprise the largest components of our total costs. Further increases in the price of these items could further materially increase our operating costs and materially adversely affect our profit margins. Similarly, transportation and health care costs have risen steadily over the past few years and represent an increasing burden for us. Although we try to contain these costs whenever possible, and although we try to pass along increased costs in the form of price increases to our customers, we may be unsuccessful in doing so, and even when successful, the timing of such price increases may lag significantly behind our incurrence of higher costs.\nWe rely on several key employees whose absence or loss could disrupt our operations or be adverse to our business.\nWe are highly dependent on the experience of our management in the continuing development of our operations. The loss of the services of certain of these individuals would have a material adverse effect on our business. Although we have employment and non-competition agreements with certain of our key employees, as a practical matter, those agreements will not assure the retention of our employees, and we may not be able to enforce all of the provisions in any employment or non-competition agreement. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to manage our development and future growth. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. Our failure to recruit additional key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, and incurrence of additional indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants, make payments on our debt and limit our growth.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding indebtedness of $177.3 million. Our outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences for investors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nit may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our Credit Agreement, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of the agreements governing any additional indebtedness, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under such agreements;\n\u00b7\nthe covenants contained in our debt agreements, including our Credit Agreement, limit our ability to borrow money in the future for acquisitions, capital expenditures or to meet our operating expenses or other general corporate obligations;\n\u00b7\nthe amount of our interest expense may increase because a substantial portion of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which, if interest rates increase, could result in higher interest expense;\n\u00b7\nwe may need to use a portion of our cash flows to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the amount of money we have for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other business activities;\n\u00b7\nwe may have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u00b7\nwe may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our industry or the economy in general; and\n\u00b7\nour debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate.\nOur ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors. We cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our existing or future debt and meet our other obligations. If we do not have enough money to service our existing or future debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing or future debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity. We may not be able to refinance our existing or future debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nOur manufacturing operations are dependent on third-party suppliers.\nAlthough we are not dependent on any one supplier, we are dependent on the ability of our third-party suppliers to supply our raw materials, as well as certain specific component parts. Failure by our third-party suppliers to meet our requirements could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that our third-party suppliers will dedicate sufficient resources to meet our scheduled delivery requirements or that our suppliers will have sufficient resources to satisfy our requirements during any period of\nsustained demand. Failure of suppliers to supply, or delays in supplying, our raw materials or certain components, or allocations in the supply of certain high demand raw components could materially adversely affect our operations and ability to meet our own delivery schedules on a timely and competitive basis.\nFailure to maintain adequate internal controls could adversely affect our business.\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to include in each of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, a report containing our management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and an attestation report of our independent auditor. These laws, rules and regulations continue to evolve and could become increasingly stringent in the future. We have undertaken actions to enhance our ability to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including, but not limited to, the engagement of consultants, the documentation of existing controls and the implementation of new controls or modification of existing controls as deemed appropriate.\nWe continue to devote substantial time and resources to the documentation and testing of our controls, and to plan for and the implementation of remedial efforts in those instances where remediation is indicated. As indicated below, as of December 31, 2015, our management determined that there were material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including remediating any material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended in the future, we could be subject to regulatory actions, civil or criminal penalties or shareholder litigation. In addition, failure to maintain adequate internal controls could result in financial statements that do not accurately reflect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We believe that the out-of-pocket costs, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from running our day-to-day operations and operational changes caused by the need to comply with the requirements of Section 404 will continue to be significant.\nThere are inherent limitations in all internal control systems over financial reporting, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nWhile we continue to take action to ensure compliance with the internal control, disclosure control and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the SEC, there are inherent limitations in our ability to control all circumstances. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls can prevent all errors and all frauds. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be evaluated in relation to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our management determined that there were material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as follows:\n(1)\nThe Company did not maintain internal control over financial reporting that was appropriately designed, adequately documented and operating effectively to support the accurate and timely reporting of revenue recognition. Specifically, the Company did not design and maintain effective controls to ensure:\n\u00b7\nrevenue recognition policies are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles\n\u00b7\nestimates of percent complete are accurate\n\u00b7\nall projects are supported by executed contracts, including approved change orders\n\u00b7\nbillings are approved\n\u00b7\nthere is appropriate systems access and controls over schedules\n\u00b7\nappropriate review of contracts by accounting personnel\n(2)\nThe Company did not implement effective internal control over financial reporting, either divisional specific or corporate monitoring controls for Zhongli in China acquired in December 2014 and PMFG acquired in September 2015.\n(3)\nThe Company did not maintain a sufficient complement of personnel with an appropriate level of knowledge of accounting, experience and training commensurate with its financial reporting requirements and increased size due to recent acquisitions.\n(4)\nThe Company did not maintain internal control over financial reporting that were appropriately designed, adequately documented and operated within its decentralized structure to:\n\u00b7\ndetermine the completeness and accuracy of reports and spreadsheets used in the execution of internal controls over financial reporting\n\u00b7\ndetermine the appropriateness of manual journal entries\n\u00b7\nmaintain an effective information technology general control environment, including restricting access to certain key financial systems and records to appropriate users\n\u00b7\nmaintenance of appropriate segregation of duties in the purchasing process.\nIf we are not able to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed. We can give no assurances that any additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future due to our failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting.\nIf we do not develop improved products and new products in a timely manner in response to industry demands, our business and revenues will be adversely affected.\nOur industry is characterized by ongoing technological developments and changing customer requirements. As a result, our success and continued growth depend, in part, on our ability in a timely manner to develop or acquire rights to, and successfully introduce into the marketplace, enhancements of existing products and new products that incorporate technological advances, meet customer requirements and respond to products developed by our competition. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing or acquiring such rights to products on a timely basis or that such products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace.\nOur business can be significantly affected by changes in technology and regulatory standards.\nThe air pollution control and filtration industry is characterized by changing technology, competitively imposed process standards and regulatory requirements, each of which influences the demand for our products and services. Changes in legislative, regulatory or industrial requirements may render certain of our products and processes obsolete. Acceptance of new products and services may also be affected by the adoption of new government regulations requiring stricter standards. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to respond with new and enhanced products on a timely basis will be a significant factor in our ability to grow and to remain competitive. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive or that certain of our products or services will not become obsolete.\nWork stoppages or similar difficulties could significantly disrupt our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, 196 of our approximately 1,170 employees are represented by international or independent labor unions under various union contracts that expire from May 1, 2016 to November 11, 2019. It is possible that our workforce will become more unionized in the future. Although we consider our employee relations to generally be good, our existing labor agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at one or more of our facilities in the future and we may be affected by other labor disputes. A work stoppage at one or more of our facilities may have a material adverse effect on our business. Unionization activities could also increase our costs, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nAdditionally, a work stoppage at one of our suppliers could adversely affect our operations if an alternative source of supply were not readily available. Work stoppages by employees of our customers also could result in reduced demand for our products.\nLiability to customers under warranties may adversely affect our reputation, our ability to obtain future business and our earnings.\nWe provide certain warranties as to the proper operation and conformance to specifications of the products we manufacture or produce. Failure of our products to operate properly or to meet specifications may increase our costs by requiring additional engineering resources and services, replacement of parts and equipment or monetary reimbursement to customers. We have in the past received warranty claims, are currently subject to warranty claims, and we expect to continue to receive claims in the future. To the extent that we incur substantial warranty claims in any period, our reputation, our ability to obtain future business and our earnings could be adversely affected.\nOur use of subcontractors could potentially harm our profitability and business reputation.\nOccasionally we act as a prime contractor in some of the engineered projects we undertake. In our capacity as lead provider and when acting as a subcontractor, we perform a majority of the work on our projects with our own resources and typically subcontract only such specialized activities as electrical work, concrete work, insulation, conveyors and controls. In our industry, the lead contractor is normally responsible for the performance of the entire contract, including subcontract work. Thus, when acting as a prime contractor, we are subject to risk associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated.\nWe employ subcontractors at various locations around the world to meet our customers\u2019 needs in a timely manner, meet local content requirements and reduce costs. Subcontractors generally perform the majority of our manufacturing for international customers. We also utilize subcontractors in North America. The use of subcontractors decreases our control over the performance of these functions and could result in project delays, escalated costs and substandard quality. These risks could adversely affect our profitability and business reputation. In addition, many of our competitors, who have greater financial resources and greater bargaining power than we have, use the same subcontractors that we use and could potentially influence our ability to hire these subcontractors. If we were to lose relationships with key subcontractors, our business could be adversely impacted.\nCurrency fluctuations may reduce profits on our foreign sales or increase our costs, either of which could adversely affect our financial results.\nGiven that approximately 38% of our revenues are outside the United States., we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Translation losses resulting from currency fluctuations may adversely affect the profits from our operations and have a negative impact on our financial results. Foreign currency fluctuations may also make our systems and products more expensive for our customers, which could have a negative impact on our sales. In addition, we purchase some foreign-made products directly from and through our subcontractors. Due to the multiple currencies involved in our business, foreign currency positions partially offset and are netted against one another to reduce exposure. We cannot assure that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will not make these products more expensive to purchase. Increases in our direct or indirect cost of purchasing these products could negatively impact our financial results if we are not able to pass those increased costs on to our customers.\nWe might be unable to protect our intellectual property rights and our products could infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which could expose us to costly disputes.\nAlthough we believe that our products do not infringe patents or violate the proprietary rights of others, it is possible that our existing patent rights may not be valid or that infringement of existing or future patents or proprietary rights may occur. In the event our products infringe patents or proprietary rights of others, we may be required to modify the design of our products or obtain a license for certain technology. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so in a timely manner, upon acceptable terms and conditions, or at all. Failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect upon our business. Moreover, if our products infringe patents or proprietary rights of others, we could, under certain circumstances, become liable for damages, which also could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks related to our pension and other post-retirement plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.\nSignificant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors may adversely affect our results of operations and pension contributions in future periods. GAAP requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates. We establish the discount rate used to determine the present value of the projected and accumulated benefit obligation at the end of each year based upon the available market rates for high quality, fixed-income investments. An increase in the discount rate would increase future pension expense and, conversely, a decrease in the discount rate would decrease future pension expense. Funding requirements for our U.S. pension plans may become more significant. The ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. For a discussion regarding the significant assumptions used to estimate pension expense, including discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies, see \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nIncreased information technology security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, and products.\nIncreased global information technology security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and communications. While we\nattempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks and products remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information and communications, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations.\nIn addition, we could be subject to legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and regulatory penalties if confidential information relating to our employees or other parties is misappropriated from our systems and networks.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance and investors may not be able to resell shares they purchase at their purchase price.\nThe stock market has experienced and may in the future experience volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, substantial volatility. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the sales price of our common stock on the NASDAQ has ranged from a low of $6.87 to a high of $15.69 per share. We expect our common stock to continue to be subject to fluctuations. Broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Factors that could cause fluctuation in the common stock price may include, among other things:\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7\nadverse general economic conditions, including, but not limited to, withdrawals of investments in the stock markets generally or a tightening of credit available to potential acquirers of businesses, that result in a lower average prices being paid for public company shares and lower valuations being placed on businesses;\n\u00b7\nother domestic and international macroeconomic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u00b7\nour failure to meet the expectations of the investment community;\n\u00b7\nindustry trends and the business success of our customers;\n\u00b7\nloss of key customers;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of technological advances by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\ncurrent events affecting the political and economic environment in the United States;\n\u00b7\nconditions or trends in our industry, including demand for our products and services, technological advances and governmental regulations;\n\u00b7\nlitigation or other proceedings involving or affecting us; and\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of our key personnel.\nThe realization of any of these risks and other factors beyond our control could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly.\nThe number of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our stock.\nWe have reserved 3.3 million shares of our common stock for issuance under our 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2007 Plan\u201d), which may include option grants, stock grants and restricted stock grants. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 2.8 million options or shares of restricted stock have been issued under the 2007 Plan. Icarus, an affiliate of ours, owns warrants to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock that have piggy-back rights granting it the right to require that we register such shares in the event we file any registration statements in the future.\nWe had outstanding options to purchase approximately 0.1 million shares of our common stock under our 1997 Stock Option Plan, and outstanding options to purchase approximately 1.8 million shares of our common stock and outstanding restricted stock units relating to approximately 0.3 million shares of our common stock under our 2007 plan as of December 31, 2015. The shares under both plans are registered for resale on currently effective registration statements.\nWe may issue additional restricted securities or register additional shares of common stock under the Securities Act in the future. The issuance of a significant number of shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options or warrants, vesting of restricted stock units, or the availability for sale, or resale, of a substantial number of the shares of common stock under registration statements, under Rule 144 or otherwise, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOne or more issuances of shares of our common stock under our stock incentive plan or securities in connection with financing transactions or the conversion of warrants will dilute current shareholders.\nPursuant to our stock incentive plan, we may grant stock awards to our employees, directors and consultants. Dilution will occur upon exercise of any outstanding stock awards convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common stock. Moreover, if we raise additional funds by issuing additional common stock, or securities, further dilution to our existing shareholders will result. In addition, we have historically issued warrants to purchase common shares in conjunction with business acquisitions, debt issuances and employment contracts, of which 250,000 warrants are currently outstanding, which may cause dilution when exercised.\nOur ability to issue preferred stock could adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 10,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series on terms that may be determined at the time of issuance by our board of directors. Accordingly, we may issue shares of any series of preferred stock that would rank senior to our common stock as to voting or dividend rights or rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up.\nCertain provisions in our charter documents have anti-takeover effects.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us. Such provisions, including those limiting who may call special shareholders\u2019 meetings, together with the possible issuance of our preferred stock without shareholder approval, may make it more difficult for other persons, without the approval of our board of directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire substantial amounts of our common stock or to launch other takeover attempts that a shareholder might consider to be in such shareholder\u2019s best interest.", "PERMNO": 11499, "SIC": 3564, "TIC": "CECE"}
