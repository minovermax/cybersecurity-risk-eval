{"cik": "1592057", "company": "Enviva Partners, LP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThere are many factors that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution. New risks may emerge at any time and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect financial performance. Each of the risks described below could adversely impact the value of our common units.\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described in this Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d These risks include the following:\n\u2022We may not have sufficient cash from operations following the establishment of cash reserves and payment of costs and expenses, including cost reimbursements to our General Partner and its affiliates, to enable us to pay quarterly distributions to our unitholders at our current distribution rate.\n\u2022We will derive substantially all our revenues from six customers in 2021, five of which are in Europe. If we fail to continue to diversify our customer base, our results of operations, business and financial position and ability to pay distributions to our unitholders could be materially adversely affected.\n\u2022Changes in laws or government policies, incentives and taxes related to low-carbon and renewable energy may affect customer demand for our products.\n\u2022Challenges to or delays in the issuance of air permits, or our failure to comply with our permits, could impair our operations and ability to expand our production.\n\u2022Federal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to forestry products and the potential for related litigation could result in increased costs and/or additional operating restrictions and delays, which could cause a decline in the demand for our products and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022We may be unable to complete our construction projects on time, and our construction costs could increase to levels that make the return on our investment less than expected.\n\u2022The satisfactory delivery of substantially all of our production is dependent on continuous access to infrastructure at our owned, leased and third-party-operated terminals. Loss of access to our ports of shipment and destination, including through failure of terminal equipment and port closures, could adversely affect our financial results and cash available for distribution.\n\u2022Failure to maintain effective quality control systems at our production plants and deep-water marine terminals could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\n\u2022Our business is subject to operating hazards and other operational risks, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We may also not be adequately insured against such events.\n\u2022Significant increases in the cost, or decreases in the availability, of raw materials or sourced wood pellets could result in lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows, or impede our ability to meet commitments to our customers.\n\u2022We are exposed to the credit risk of our contract counterparties, including the customers for our products, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers could adversely affect our financial results and cash available for distribution.\n\u2022The international nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks, including foreign exchange risk and unfavorable political, regulatory and tax conditions in foreign countries.\n\u2022Enviva Holdings, LP owns and controls our General Partner, which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations. Our General Partner and its affiliates, including Enviva Holdings, LP, have conflicts of interest with us and limited duties, and they may favor their own interests to our detriment and that of our unitholders.\n\u2022The board of directors of our General Partner may modify or revoke our cash distribution policy at any time at its discretion. Our partnership agreement does not require us to pay any distributions at all.\n\u2022Our partnership agreement eliminates and replaces our General Partner\u2019s fiduciary duties to holders of our units.\n\u2022Our partnership agreement restricts the remedies available to holders of our units for actions taken by our General Partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.\n\u2022Our sponsor has certain incentive distribution rights that reduce the amount of our cash available for distribution to our common unitholders.\n\u2022Holders of our common units have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our General Partner or its directors.\n\u2022We may issue additional units without unitholder approval, which would dilute existing unitholder ownership interests.\n\u2022The New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d) does not require a publicly traded partnership like us to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements.\n\u2022Our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and not being subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation. If the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, or we become subject to entity-level taxation for state tax purposes, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced.\n\u2022The tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes or differing interpretations, possibly applied on a retroactive basis.\n\u2022Even if unitholders do not receive any cash distributions from us, unitholders will be required to pay taxes on their share of our taxable income.\n\u2022Tax-exempt entities face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may not have sufficient cash from operations following the establishment of cash reserves and payment of costs and expenses, including cost reimbursements to our General Partner and its affiliates, to enable us to pay quarterly distributions to our unitholders at our current distribution rate.\nWe may not have sufficient cash each quarter to enable us to pay quarterly distributions at our current distribution rate. The amount of cash we can distribute on our common units principally depends on the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which fluctuates from quarter to quarter based on various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022the volume and quality of wood pellets that we are able to produce or source and profitably sell, which could be adversely affected by, among other things, operating or technical difficulties at our plants or terminals;\n\u2022the prices at which we are able to sell our products;\n\u2022the ability and willingness of our customers to fully perform under our off-take agreements;\n\u2022our ability to successfully negotiate, complete and integrate assets and business or to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, as well as our ability to organically expand our operations in a cost-effective manner;\n\u2022the level of competition from other wood pellet producers and suppliers of competing sources of fuel for heat and power generation, as well as the price and availability of such competing sources; and\n\u2022the impact of prevailing regional economic and regulatory conditions in the areas in which we and our customers operate.\nIn addition, the actual amount of cash we have available for distribution depends on other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the level of capital expenditures we make, fluctuations in our working capital needs, our cost of capital and ability to access the capital markets, fluctuations in interest rates, our debt service requirements and other liabilities, restrictions contained in our existing or future debt agreements and the amount of cash reserves established by our General Partner.\nWe will derive substantially all our revenues from six customers in 2021, five of which are located in Europe. If we fail to continue to diversify our customer base, our results of operations, business and financial position and ability to pay distributions to our unitholders could be materially adversely affected.\nOur contracts with Drax, Lynemouth Power, MGT, RWE, \u00d8rsted and Sumitomo, five of which are located in Europe, will represent substantially all of our product sales volumes in 2021; as a result, we face counterparty and geographic concentration risk. The ability of each of our customers to perform its obligations under a contract with us will depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control and may include the overall financial condition of the counterparty, the counterparty\u2019s access to capital, the condition of the regional and global power, heat and combined heat and power generation industry, continuing regulatory and economic support for wood pellets as a fuel source, spot market pricing trends and general economic conditions. In addition, in depressed market conditions, our customers may no longer need the amount of our products they have contracted for or may be able to obtain comparable products at a lower price. If economic, political, regulatory or financial market conditions in Europe deteriorate and/or our customers experience a significant downturn in their business or financial condition, they may attempt to renegotiate, reject or declare force majeure under our contracts. Should any counterparty fail to honor its obligations under a contract with us, we could sustain losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution. We may also decide to renegotiate our existing contracts on less favorable terms and/or at reduced volumes in order to preserve our relationships with our customers.\nUpon the expiration of our off-take contracts, our customers may decide not to recontract on terms as favorable to us as our current contracts, or at all. For example, our current customers may acquire wood pellets from other providers that offer more competitive pricing or logistics or develop their own sources of wood pellets. Some of our customers could also exit their current business or be acquired by other companies that purchase wood pellets from other providers. The demand for wood pellets or their prevailing prices at the times at which our current off-take contracts expire may also render entry into new long-term-off-take contracts difficult or impossible.\nAny reduction in the amount of wood pellets purchased by our customers or our inability to renegotiate or replace our existing contracts on economically acceptable terms, or our failure to successfully penetrate new markets within and outside of Europe in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, as well as our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nTermination penalties within our off-take contracts may not fully compensate us for our total economic losses.\nCertain of our off-take contracts provide the customer with a right of termination for various events of convenience or changes in law or policy. Although some of these contracts are subject to certain protective termination payments, the termination payments made by our customers may not fully compensate us for losses. We may be unable to re-contract our production at favorable prices or at all, and our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders, may be materially adversely affected as a result. Currently, we derive substantially all of our revenues from customers in Europe. If we fail to continue to diversify our customer base geographically within and outside of Europe in the future, our results of operations, business and financial position and ability to pay distributions to our unitholders could be materially adversely affected.\nOur long-term off-take contracts with our customers may only partially offset certain increases in our costs or preclude us from taking advantage of relatively high wood pellet prices in the broader markets.\nOur long-term off-take contracts typically set base prices subject to annual price escalation and other pricing adjustments for changes in certain of our underlying costs of operations, including, in some cases, for stumpage or diesel fuel. However, such cost pass-through mechanisms may only pass a portion of our total costs through to our customers. If our operating costs increase significantly during the terms of our long-term off-take contracts beyond the levels of pricing and cost protection afforded to us under the terms of such contracts, our results of operations, business and financial position, and ability to pay distributions to our unitholders, could be adversely affected.\nMoreover, during periods when the prevailing market price of wood pellets exceeds the prices under our long-term off-take contracts, our revenues could be significantly lower than they otherwise would have been were we not party to such contracts for substantially all our production. In addition, our current and future competitors may be in a better position than we are to take advantage of relatively high prices during such periods.\nThe growth of our business depends in part on locating and acquiring interests in additional wood pellet production plants and marine terminals at favorable prices.\nOur business strategy includes growing our business through drop-down and third-party acquisitions that increase our cash generated from operations and cash available for distribution on a per-unit basis. Various factors could affect the availability of attractive projects to grow our business, including:\n\u2022our sponsor\u2019s failure to complete its development projects in a timely manner or at all, which could result from, among other things, permitting challenges, failure to procure requisite financing or equipment, construction difficulties or an inability to obtain off-take contracts on acceptable terms;\n\u2022our sponsor\u2019s failure to offer its assets for sale;\n\u2022our inability to exercise our right of first offer with respect to any asset that our sponsor offers to us; and\n\u2022fewer accretive third-party acquisition opportunities than we expect, which could result from, among other things, available projects having less desirable economic returns, competition, anti-trust concerns or higher risk profiles than we believe suitable for our business plan and investment strategy.\nAny of these factors could prevent us from executing our growth strategy or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nAny acquisitions we make may reduce, rather than increase, our cash generated from operations on a per-unit basis.\nWe may consummate acquisitions we believe will be accretive, but result in a decrease in our cash available for distribution per unit. Any acquisition involves potential risks, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022mistaken assumptions about revenues and costs, including synergies;\n\u2022the inability to successfully integrate businesses we acquire;\n\u2022the inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our business and newly acquired assets;\n\u2022the assumption of unknown liabilities;\n\u2022limitations on our access to indemnification from the seller;\n\u2022incorrect assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt;\n\u2022the diversion of management\u2019s attention to other business concerns;\n\u2022unforeseen difficulties in connection with operating newly acquired assets or in new geographic areas;\n\u2022customer or key employee losses at acquired businesses; and\n\u2022the inability to meet obligations in off-take or other contracts associated with acquisitions.\nIf we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of our funds and other resources to acquisitions.\nRegulatory and Litigation Risks\nChanges in laws or government policies, incentives and taxes related to low-carbon and renewable energy may affect customer demand for our products.\nConsumers of utility-grade wood pellets currently use our products either as part of a binding obligation to generate a certain percentage of low-carbon energy or because they receive direct or indirect financial support or incentives to do so. Financial support is often necessary to cover the generally higher costs of wood pellets compared to conventional fossil fuels like coal. In most countries, once the government implements a tax (e.g., the U.K.\u2019s carbon price floor tax) or a preferable tariff or specific renewable energy policy either supporting a renewable energy generator or the energy generating sector as a whole, such tax, tariff or policy is guaranteed for a specified period of time, sometimes for the investment lifetime of a generator\u2019s project. However, governmental policies that currently support the use of biomass may adversely modify their tax, tariff or incentive regimes, and the future availability of such taxes, tariffs or incentive regimes, either in current jurisdictions beyond the prescribed timeframes or in new jurisdictions, is uncertain. Demand for wood pellets could be substantially lower than expected if government support is removed, reduced or delayed or, in the future, is insufficient to enable successful deployment of biomass power at the levels currently projected. In addition, regulatory changes such as new requirements to install additional pollution control technology could require us to curtail or amend operations to meet new greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emission limits. This may also affect demand for our products in addition to increasing our operational costs.\nBiomass energy generation requires the use of biomass that is derived from acceptable sources and is demonstrably sustainable. This typically is implemented through biomass sustainability criteria, which either are a mandatory element of eligibility for financial subsidies to biomass energy generators or will become mandatory in the future. For more information, see our risk factor titled \u201cChanges in the treatment of biomass could adversely impact our business.\u201d As a biomass fuel supplier, the viability of our business is therefore dependent on our ability to comply with such requirements. This may restrict the types of biomass we can use and the geographic regions from which we source our raw materials, and may require us to reduce the GHG emissions associated with our supply and production processes.\nCurrently, some elements of the criteria with which we must comply, including rules relating to forest management practices and carbon accounting, are under revision. Certain requirements, such as the regulations in place in jurisdictions from which we source biomass, may be beyond our ability to control. If different sustainability requirements are adopted in the future, demand for our products could be materially reduced in certain markets, and our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders, may be materially adversely affected.\nChallenges to or delays in the issuance of air permits, or our failure to comply with our permits, could impair our operations and ability to expand our production.\nOur plants are subject to the requirements of the Clean Air Act and must either receive minor source permits from the states in which they are located or a major source permit, which is subject to the approval of the EPA. In general, our facilities are eligible for minor source permits following the application of pollution control technologies. However, we could experience substantial delays with respect to obtaining such permits, including as a result of any challenges to the issuance of our permits or other factors, which could impair our ability to operate our wood pellet production plants or expand our production capacity. In addition, any new air permits we receive could require that we incur additional expenses to install emissions control technologies, limit our operations and impede our ability to satisfy emission limitations and/or stringent testing requirements to demonstrate compliance therewith. Failure to meet such requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to forestry products and the potential for related litigation could result in increased costs and/or additional operating restrictions and delays, which could cause a decline in the demand for our products and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur raw materials are byproducts of traditional timber management and harvesting, principally low-value wood materials such as thinnings and the tops and limbs of trees that are generated in a harvest and industrial residuals (chips, sawdust and other wood industry byproducts). Commercial forestry is regulated by complex regulatory frameworks at the federal, state and local levels. Among other federal laws, the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act have been applied to commercial forestry operations through agency regulations and court decisions, as well as through the delegation to states to implement and monitor compliance with such laws. State forestry laws, as well as land-use regulations and zoning ordinances at the local level, are also used to manage forests in the Southeastern United States, as well as other regions from which we may need to source raw materials in the future. Any new or modified laws or regulations at any of these levels could have the effect of reducing forestry operations in areas where we procure our raw materials and consequently may prevent us from purchasing raw materials in an economic manner, or at all. In addition, future regulation of, or litigation concerning, the use of timberlands, the protection of endangered species, the promotion of forest biodiversity and the response to and prevention of wildfires, as well as litigation, campaigns or other measures advanced by special interest groups, could also reduce the availability of the raw materials required for our operations.\nChanges in the treatment of biomass could adversely impact our business.\nMultiple regulatory agencies, including in jurisdictions where we sell our products, have noted that biomass can support a transition away from fossil fuels and towards a more sustainable energy sector. However, when poorly managed, use of biomass can be related to land conversion, biodiversity and GHG emissions. Therefore, various rules have been issued to regulate the sustainability claims associated with the use of biomass, which in turn may require us to adopt certain practices in our operations.\nFor example, the European Union has promulgated directives on renewable energy that, among other things, establish targets for renewable energy supply and establish certain sustainability requirements for biomass, including requirements related to carbon stocks and land use. If the wood pellets we produce do not conform to these or future requirements, our customers would not be able to count energy generated therefrom towards these renewable energy goals, which could decrease demand for our products. Biomass has been under additional regulatory scrutiny in recent years to develop standards to safeguard against adverse environmental effects from its use. Although regulators continue to consider biomass harvested with certain practices to be sustainable, certain special interest groups that focus on environmental issues have expressed their\nopposition to the use of biomass, both publicly and directly, to domestic and foreign regulators, policy makers, power, heat or combined heat and power generators (\u201cgenerators\u201d) and other industrial users of biomass. These groups are also actively lobbying, litigating and undertaking other actions domestically and abroad in an effort to increase the regulation of, reduce or eliminate the incentives and support for, or otherwise delay, interfere with or impede the production and use of biomass for or by generators. For example, several commenters to the EU\u2019s proposed sustainable finance criteria for climate change mitigation and adaptation have encouraged the EU not to classify the use of forest-related biomass as sustainable. Such efforts, if successful, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, business and financial condition and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nOur operations are subject to stringent environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to stringent federal, regional, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern environmental protection, occupational health and safety, the release or discharge of materials into the environment, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the investigation and remediation of contaminated sites and allocation of liability for cleanup of such sites. These laws and regulations may restrict or impact our business in many ways, including by requiring us to acquire permits or other approvals to conduct regulated activities, limiting our air emissions or wastewater discharges or requiring us to install costly equipment to control, reduce or treat such emissions or discharges and impacting our ability to modify or expand our operations. We may be required to make significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, suspension or revocation of permits and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. Adoption of new or modified environmental laws and regulations may impair the operation of our business, delay or prevent expansion of existing facilities or construction of new facilities and otherwise result in increased costs and liabilities, which may be material.\nThe actions of certain special interest groups could adversely impact our business.\nCertain special interest groups that focus on environmental issues have expressed their opposition to the use of biomass, both publicly and directly to domestic and foreign regulators, policy makers, power, heat or combined heat and power generators (\u201cgenerators\u201d) and other industrial users of biomass. These groups are also actively lobbying, litigating and undertaking other actions domestically and abroad in an effort to increase the regulation of, reduce or eliminate the incentives and support for, or otherwise delay, interfere with or impede the production and use of biomass for or by generators. Such efforts, if successful, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, business and financial condition, and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nOur net-zero goals, including our failure to achieve them, could adversely affect our business.\nWe recently announced our intention to become carbon-neutral in our operations by 2030 and to publicly report our progress against these goals. Our estimates concerning the timing and cost of implementing our goals are subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which are outside of our control. We also may face greater scrutiny as a result of our announcement and publication of our progress, and our failure to achieve our voluntary net-zero goals could lead to adverse press coverage or other public attention.\nOperational Risks\nWe may be unable to complete our construction projects on time, and our construction costs could increase to levels that make the return on our investment less than expected.\nHistorically, we typically have acquired wood pellet production plants, marine export terminals and other assets that had already commenced commercial operations. In response to the increasing demand for our product, we have begun undertaking expansion projects at some of our plants to increase their production capacity or make other improvements.\nWe may face delays or unexpected developments in completing our current or future construction projects, including as a result of our failure to timely obtain the equipment, services or access to infrastructure necessary for the operation of our projects at budgeted costs, maintain all necessary rights to land access and use and/or obtain and/or maintain environmental and other permits or approvals. These circumstances could prevent our construction projects from commencing operations or from meeting our original expectations concerning timing, operational performance, the capital expenditures necessary for their completion and the returns they will achieve. Our inability to complete and transition our construction projects into financially successful operating projects on time and within budget could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, as well as our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nThe satisfactory delivery of substantially all of our production is dependent on continuous access to infrastructure at our owned, leased and third-party-operated terminals. Loss of access to our ports of shipment and destination, including through failure of terminal equipment and port closures, could adversely affect our financial results and cash available for distribution.\nSubstantially all of our production is dependent on infrastructure at our owned, leased and third-party-operated ports. Should we suffer a catastrophic failure of the equipment at these ports or otherwise experience port closures, including for security or weather-related reasons, we could be unable to fulfill off-take obligations or incur substantial additional transportation costs, which would reduce our cash flow. Moreover, we rely on various ports of destination, as well as third parties who provide stevedoring or other services at our ports of shipment and destination or from whom we charter oceangoing vessels and crews, to transport our product to our customers. Loss of access to these ports for any reason, or failure of such third-party service providers to uphold their contractual obligations, may impact our ability to fulfill our obligations under our off-take contracts, cause interruptions to our shipping schedule and cause us to incur substantial additional transportation or other costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain effective quality control systems at our production plants and deep-water marine terminals could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur customers require a reliable supply of wood pellets that meet stringent product specifications. We have built our operations and assets to consistently deliver and certify the highest levels of product quality and performance, which is critical to the success of our business and depends significantly on the effectiveness of our quality control systems, including the design and efficacy of our quality control systems, the success of our quality training program and our ability to ensure that our employees and contract counterparties adhere to our quality control policies and guidelines. Moreover, any significant failure or deterioration of our quality control systems could impact our ability to deliver product that meets our customers\u2019 specifications and, in turn, could lead to rejection of our product by our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to operating hazards and other operational risks, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We may also not be adequately insured against such events.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by operating hazards and other risks to our operations. We produce a combustible product that may under certain circumstances present a risk of fires and explosions or other hazards. Moreover, severe weather, such as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other natural disasters, climatic phenomena, such as drought, and other catastrophic events, such as plant or shipping disasters, could impact our operations by causing damage to our facilities and equipment, affecting our ability to deliver our product to our customers and impacting our customers\u2019 ability to take delivery of our products. Such events may also adversely affect the ability of our suppliers or service providers to provide us with the raw materials or services we require or the ability to load, transport and unload our product.\nIn addition, the scientific community has concluded that severe weather will increase in frequency and intensity as result of increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, and that climate change will have significant physical effects, including sea-level rise, increased frequency and severity of hurricanes and other storms, flooding, drought and forest fires. We and our suppliers operate in coastal and wooded areas in geographic regions that are susceptible to such climate impacts.\nWe maintain insurance policies to mitigate against certain risks related to our business, in types and amounts that we believe are reasonable depending on the circumstances surrounding each identified risk; however, we may not be fully insured against all operating hazards and other operational risks incident to our business. Furthermore, we may be unable to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates, if at all. As a result of market conditions and certain claims we may make under our insurance policies, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies could escalate. In some instances, insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage or at unreasonable rates. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we are not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders.\nWe may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain and improve our facilities.\nAlthough we currently use a portion of our cash reserves and cash generated from our operations to maintain, develop and improve our assets and facilities, such investment may, over time, be insufficient to preserve the operating profile required for us to meet our planned profitability or meet the evolving quality and product specifications demanded by our customers. Moreover, our current and future construction and other capital projects may be capital-intensive or suffer cost-overruns. Accordingly, if we exceed our budgeted capital expenditures and/or additional capital expenditures become necessary in the future and we are unable to execute our construction, maintenance or improvement programs successfully, within budget, and\nin a timely manner, our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders, may be materially adversely affected.\nOur business and operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations.\nOur business is affected by seasonal fluctuations. The cost of producing wood pellets tends to be higher in the winter months because of increases in the cost of delivered raw materials, primarily due to a reduction in accessibility during cold and wet weather conditions. Our raw materials typically have higher moisture content during this period, resulting in a lower product yield; moreover, the cost of drying wood fiber increases during periods of lower ambient temperatures.\nThe increase in demand for power and heat during the winter months drives greater customer demand for wood pellets. As some of our wood pellet supply to our customers are sourced from third-party purchases, we may experience higher wood pellet costs and a reduction in our gross margin during the winter months. These seasonal fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cause comparisons of operating measures between consecutive quarters to not be as meaningful as comparisons between longer reporting periods.\nMarket and Credit Risks\nSignificant increases in the cost, or decreases in the availability, of raw materials or sourced wood pellets could result in lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows, or impede our ability to meet commitments to our customers.\nWe purchase wood fiber from third-party landowners and other suppliers for use at our plants. Our reliance on third parties to secure wood fiber exposes us to potential price volatility and unavailability of such raw materials, and the associated costs may exceed our ability to pass through such price increases under our contracts with our customers. Further, delays or disruptions in obtaining wood fiber may result from a number of factors affecting our suppliers, including extreme weather, production or delivery disruptions, inadequate logging capacity, labor disputes, impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, the inability of suppliers to comply with regulatory or sustainability requirements or decreased availability of raw materials. In addition, other companies, whether or not in our industry, could procure wood fiber within our procurement areas and adversely change regional market dynamics, resulting in insufficient quantities of raw material or higher prices. Any of these events could increase our operating costs or prevent us from meeting our commitments to our customers, and thereby could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nAny interruption or delay in the supply of wood fiber, or our inability to obtain wood fiber at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demands of our customers and expand our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nIn addition to our production, we purchase wood pellets produced by other suppliers to fulfill our obligations under our portfolio of long-term off-take contracts or take advantage of market dislocations on an opportunistic basis. Any reliance on other wood pellet producers exposes us to the risk that such suppliers will fail to satisfy their obligations to us pursuant to the associated off-take contracts, including by failing to timely meet quality specifications and volume requirements. Any such failure could increase our costs or prevent us from meeting our commitments to our customers, and thereby could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our contract counterparties, including the customers for our products, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers could adversely affect our financial results and cash available for distribution.\nWe are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our contract counterparties, including our long-term off-take customers and suppliers. Our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully eliminate counterparty credit risk. If we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers or suppliers, or if their creditworthiness deteriorates unexpectedly, any resulting nonpayment or nonperformance by them could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nImpacts to the cost or availability of transportation and other infrastructure could reduce our revenues.\nDisruptions to or increases in the cost of local or regional transportation services and other forms of infrastructure, such as electricity, due to shortages of vessels, barges, railcars or trucks, weather-related problems, flooding, drought, accidents, mechanical difficulties, bankruptcy, strikes, lockouts, bottlenecks or other events could increase our costs, temporarily impair\nour ability to deliver products to our customers and might, in certain circumstances, constitute a force majeure event under our customer contracts, permitting our customers to suspend taking delivery of and paying for our products.\nIn addition, persistent disruptions in our access to infrastructure may force us to halt production as we reach storage capacity at our facilities. Accordingly, if the primary transportation services we use to transport our products are disrupted, and we are unable to find alternative transportation providers, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nWe compete with other wood pellet producers and, if growth in domestic and global demand for wood pellets meets or exceeds management\u2019s expectations, the competition within our industry may grow significantly.\nWe compete with other wood pellet production companies for the customers to whom we sell our products. Other current producers of utility-grade wood pellets include AS Graanul Invest, Pinnacle Renewable Energy Inc., Drax Biomass Inc., Fram Renewable Fuels, LLC, Highland Pellets LLC and Pacific BioEnergy Corporation. Competition in our industry is based on price, consistency and quality of product, site location, distribution and logistics capabilities, customer service, creditworthiness and reliability of supply. Some of our competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do, may develop technology superior to ours or may have production plants sited in more advantageous locations from a logistics, procurement or other cost perspective.\nIn addition, we expect global demand for solid biomass to increase significantly in the coming years. This demand growth may lead to a significant increase in the production levels of our existing competitors and may incentivize new, well-capitalized competitors to enter the industry, both of which could reduce the demand and the prices we are able to obtain under future off-take contracts. Significant price decreases or reduced demand could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nFinancial Risks\nOur level of indebtedness may increase, thereby reducing our financial flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our total debt was $926.0 million, which primarily consisted of $746.9 million outstanding under our 6.5% senior unsecured notes due 2026. In the future, we may incur additional indebtedness in order to make acquisitions or to develop our properties. Our level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u2022a significant portion of our cash flows could be used to service our indebtedness;\n\u2022the covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness may limit our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay distributions and make certain investments;\n\u2022our debt covenants may also affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry;\n\u2022a high level of debt would increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022a high level of debt may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may be less leveraged and therefore may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness would prevent us from pursuing; and\n\u2022a high level of debt may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions or general partnership or other purposes.\nIn addition, revolving borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility bear, and potentially other credit facilities we or our subsidiaries may enter into in the future will bear, interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, such variable-rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flow.\nIn addition to our debt service obligations, our operations require substantial expenditures on a continuing basis. Our ability to make scheduled debt payments, to refinance our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to fund capital and non-capital expenditures necessary to maintain the condition of our operating assets and properties, as well as to provide capacity for the growth of our business, depends on our financial and operating performance. General economic conditions and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay the interest on our debt, and future working capital borrowings or debt or equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt.\nOur exposure to risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations, as well as the hedging arrangements we may enter into to mitigate those risks, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience foreign currency exchange and interest rate volatility in our business. We began to use hedging transactions in 2016 with respect to certain of our off-take contracts which are, in part or in whole, denominated in foreign currencies, and are party to interest rate swaps with respect to a portion of our variable rate debt, in an effort to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations.\nIn addition, there may be instances in which costs and revenue will not be matched with respect to currency denomination. As a result, to the extent that existing and future off-take contracts are not denominated in U.S. Dollars, it is possible that increasing portions of our revenue, costs, assets and liabilities will be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency valuations.\nOur hedging transactions involve cost and risk and may not be effective at mitigating our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates. Although the use of hedging transactions limits our downside risk, their use may also limit future revenues. Risks inherent in our hedging transactions include the risk that counterparties to hedging contracts may be unable to perform their obligations and the risk that the terms of such contracts will not be legally enforceable. Likewise, our hedging activities may be ineffective or may not fully offset the financial impact of foreign currency exchange or interest rates fluctuations, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, business and financial position, and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur business may suffer if we lose, or are unable to attract and retain, key personnel.\nWe depend to a large extent on the services of our senior management team and other key personnel. Members of our senior management and other key employees collectively have extensive expertise in designing, building and operating wood pellet production plants or marine terminals, negotiating long-term off-take contracts and managing businesses such as ours. Competition for management and key personnel is intense, and the pool of qualified candidates is limited. The loss of any of these individuals or the failure to attract additional personnel, as needed, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and could lead to higher labor costs or reliance on less qualified personnel. In addition, if any of our executives or other key employees were to join a competitor or form a competing company, we could lose customers, suppliers, know-how and key personnel. Our success is dependent on our ability to continue to attract, employ and retain highly skilled personnel.\nThe international nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks, including foreign exchange risk and unfavorable political, regulatory and tax conditions in foreign countries.\nSubstantially all of our current product sales are to customers that operate outside of the United States. As a result, we face certain risks inherent in maintaining international operations that include foreign exchange movements, restrictions on foreign trade and investment, including currency exchange controls imposed by or in other countries and trade barriers such as export requirements, tariffs, taxes and other restrictions and expenses, which could increase the prices of our products and make our products less competitive in some countries.\nLabor strikes or work stoppages by our employees could harm our business.\nUnionization activities could occur among non-union employees. If union employees strike, participate in a work stoppage or slowdown or engage in other forms of labor strike, it could lead to disruptions in our business, increases in our operating costs and constraints on our operating flexibility. Strikes, work stoppages or an inability to negotiate future collective bargaining agreements on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nUncertainty relating to the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR in 2023 may adversely affect our current or future debt obligations, including our senior secured revolving credit facility.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021, which was extended through June 2023 for U.S. dollar LIBOR values. At this time, it is not possible to predict what such phase out, alternative reference rates or other reforms, if they occur, will have on the amount of interest paid on, or the market value of, our current or future debt obligations, including our senior secured revolving credit facility.\nThe departure of the U.K. from the EU could adversely affect our results of operations, business and financial position and ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nThe U.K. formally withdrew from the EU in January 2020 under Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union and was subject to a transition period until the end of 2020. During this period, there has been no fundamental change to U.K.-EU relations, except for the withdrawal of U.K. memberships from EU political institutions. The transition period ceased on December 31, 2020 and as of January 31, 2021 U.K.-EU relations will be determined by a new agreement.\nWe have take-or-pay off-take contracts with utilities and large generators in the U.K. and in other European markets. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 68% of our product sales were derived from contracts with customers in the U.K. and 28% of our product sales were derived from contracts with customers in other European markets.\nThe lack of precedent for an exit of a European Member State from the EU means that it is unclear how the access of U.K. businesses to the EU Single Market and how the legal and regulatory environments in the U.K. and the EU will be impacted.\nOur business is subject to cybersecurity risks.\nAs is typical of modern businesses, we are reliant on the continuous and uninterrupted operation of our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems. User access and security of our sites and IT systems can be critical elements of our operations, as are cloud security and protection against cybersecurity incidents. Any IT failure pertaining to availability, access or system security could potentially result in disruption of our activities and personnel, and could adversely affect our reputation, operations or financial performance. Potential risks to our IT systems could include unauthorized attempts to extract business-sensitive, confidential or personal information, denial of access, extortion, corruption of information, or disruption of business processes. A cybersecurity incident resulting in a security breach or failure to identify a security threat could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of sensitive, confidential information or other assets, as well as litigation, regulatory enforcement, violation of privacy or securities laws and regulations, and remediation costs, all of which could materially impact our reputation, operations or financial performance.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.\nTerrorist activities and armed conflicts could adversely affect the U.S. and global economies and could prevent us from meeting financial and other obligations or prevent our customers from meeting their obligations to us. We could experience loss of business, delays or defaults in payments from customers or disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, including if domestic and global generators are direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war. Terrorist activities and the threat of potential terrorist activities and any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect our results of operations, impair our ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely impact our ability to realize certain business strategies.\nRisks Related to Our Partnership Structure\nEnviva Holdings, LP owns and controls our General Partner, which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations. Our General Partner and its affiliates, including Enviva Holdings, LP, have conflicts of interest with us and limited duties, and they may favor their own interests to our detriment and that of our unitholders.\nEnviva Holdings, LP, owns and controls our General Partner and appoints all of the directors of our General Partner. Although our General Partner has a duty to manage us in a manner that it believes is not adverse to our interest, the executive officers and directors of our General Partner have a fiduciary duty to manage our General Partner in a manner beneficial to our sponsor. Therefore, conflicts of interest may arise between our sponsor or any of its affiliates, including our General Partner, on the one hand, and us or any of our unitholders, on the other hand. In resolving these conflicts of interest, our General Partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of our common unitholders. These conflicts may include the following:\n\u2022our General Partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us, such as our sponsor, in exercising certain rights under our partnership agreement;\n\u2022neither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires our sponsor to pursue a business strategy that favors us;\n\u2022our partnership agreement eliminates and replaces the fiduciary duties that would otherwise be owed by our General Partner with contractual standards governing its duties, limits our General Partner\u2019s liabilities and restricts the remedies available to our unitholders for actions that, without such eliminations and limitations, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty;\n\u2022except in limited circumstances, our General Partner has the power and authority to conduct our business without unitholder approval;\n\u2022our General Partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales, borrowings, issuances of additional partnership securities and the level of reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders;\n\u2022our General Partner determines the amount and timing of any cash expenditure and whether an expenditure is classified as a maintenance capital expenditure, which reduces operating surplus, or an expansion capital expenditure, which does not reduce operating surplus. This determination can affect the amount of cash from operating surplus that is distributed to our common unitholders relative to our sponsor as the holder of our incentive distribution rights;\n\u2022our General Partner may cause us to borrow funds in order to permit the payment of cash distributions;\n\u2022our partnership agreement permits us to distribute up to $39.3 million as operating surplus, even if it is generated from asset sales, borrowings other than working capital borrowings or other sources that would otherwise constitute capital surplus. This cash may be used to fund distributions to holders of our incentive distribution rights;\n\u2022our General Partner determines which costs incurred by it and its affiliates are reimbursable by us, including through the MSAs;\n\u2022our partnership agreement does not restrict our General Partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with its affiliates on our behalf;\n\u2022our General Partner intends to limit its liability regarding our contractual and other obligations;\n\u2022our General Partner may exercise its right to call and purchase common units if it and its affiliates own more than 80% of the common units;\n\u2022our General Partner controls the enforcement of obligations that it and its affiliates owe to us;\n\u2022our General Partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for us; and\n\u2022our General Partner may elect to cause us to issue common units to it in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to our sponsor\u2019s incentive distribution rights without the approval of the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our General Partner or the unitholders. This election may result in lower distributions to the common unitholders in certain situations.\nIn addition, we may compete directly with our sponsor and entities in which it has an interest for acquisition opportunities and potentially will compete with these entities for new business or extensions of the existing services provided by us.\nThe board of directors of our General Partner may modify or revoke our cash distribution policy at any time at its discretion. Our partnership agreement does not require us to pay any distributions at all.\nPursuant to our cash distribution policy, we intend to distribute quarterly at least $0.4125 per unit on all of our units to the extent we have sufficient cash after the establishment of cash reserves and the payment of our expenses, including payments to our General Partner and its affiliates. However, the board may change our cash distribution policy at any time at its discretion and could elect not to pay distributions for one or more quarters. Please read Part II, Item 5. \u201cMarket for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities-Cash Distribution Policy.\u201d\nIn addition, our partnership agreement does not require us to pay any distributions at all. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the permanence of such a policy in making an investment decision. Any modification or revocation of our cash distribution policy could substantially reduce or eliminate the amounts of distributions to our unitholders. The amount of distributions we make, if any, and the decision to make any distribution at all will be determined by the board of directors of our General Partner, whose interests may differ from those of our common unitholders. Our General Partner has limited duties to our unitholders, which may permit it to favor its own interests or the interests of our sponsor to the detriment of our common unitholders.\nOur General Partner limits its liability regarding our obligations.\nOur General Partner limits its liability under contractual arrangements between us and third parties so that the counterparties to such arrangements have recourse only against our assets, and not against our General Partner or its assets. Our General Partner may therefore cause us to incur indebtedness or other obligations that are nonrecourse to our General Partner.\nOur partnership agreement provides that any action taken by our General Partner to limit its liability is not a breach of our General Partner\u2019s duties, even if we could have obtained more favorable terms without the limitation on liability. In addition, we are obligated to reimburse or indemnify our General Partner to the extent that it incurs obligations on our behalf. Any such reimbursement or indemnification payments would reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution to our unitholders.\nWe intend to distribute a significant portion of our cash available for distribution to our partners, which could limit our ability to grow and make acquisitions.\nWe intend to distribute most of our cash available for distribution, which could cause our growth to proceed at a slower pace than that of businesses that reinvest their cash to expand ongoing operations. To the extent we issue additional units, whether in connection with acquisitions, expansion capital expenditures or otherwise, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per unit distribution level. There are no limitations in our partnership agreement on our ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units. The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt to finance our growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which, in turn, may impact the cash that we have available to distribute to our unitholders.\nOur partnership agreement eliminates and replaces our General Partner\u2019s fiduciary duties to holders of our units.\nOur partnership agreement contains provisions that eliminate and replace the fiduciary standards to which our General Partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty law. For example, our partnership agreement permits our General Partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as our General Partner, or otherwise free of fiduciary duties to us and our unitholders. This entitles our General Partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires and relieves it of any duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or our limited partners. Examples of decisions that our General Partner may make in its individual capacity include:\n\u2022how to allocate business opportunities among us and its affiliates;\n\u2022whether to exercise its call right;\n\u2022whether to seek approval of the resolution of a conflict of interest by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our General Partner;\n\u2022how to exercise its voting rights with respect to the units it owns;\n\u2022whether to exercise its registration rights;\n\u2022whether to elect to reset target distribution levels; and\n\u2022whether or not to consent to any merger or consolidation of the Partnership or amendment to the partnership agreement.\nLimited partners who own common units are treated as having consented to the provisions in the partnership agreement, including the provisions discussed above.\nOur partnership agreement restricts the remedies available to holders of our units for actions taken by our General Partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.\nOur partnership agreement contains provisions that restrict the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by our General Partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty under state fiduciary duty law. For example, our partnership agreement provides that:\n\u2022whenever our General Partner makes a determination or takes, or declines to take, any other action in its capacity as our General Partner, our General Partner is generally required to make such determination, or take or decline to take such other action, in good faith, and will not be subject to any higher standard imposed by our partnership agreement, Delaware law, or any other law, rule or regulation, or at equity;\n\u2022our General Partner and its officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages or otherwise to us or our limited partners resulting from any act or omission unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that such losses or liabilities were the result of conduct in which our General Partner or its officers or directors engaged in bad faith, meaning that they believed that the decision was adverse to our interest or, with respect to any criminal conduct, with knowledge that such conduct was unlawful; and\n\u2022our General Partner will not be in breach of its obligations under the partnership agreement or its duties to us or our limited partners if a transaction with an affiliate or the resolution of a conflict of interest is:\n(1) approved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our General Partner, although our General Partner is not obligated to seek such approval; or\n(2) approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding common units, excluding any common units owned by our General Partner and its affiliates.\nIn connection with a situation involving a transaction with an affiliate or a conflict of interest, other than one where our General Partner is permitted to act in its sole discretion, any determination by our General Partner must be made in good faith. If an affiliate transaction or the resolution of a conflict of interest is not approved by our common unitholders or the conflicts committee then it will be presumed that, in making its decision, taking any action or failing to act, the board of directors acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of us or of any limited partner, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption.\nOur sponsor and other affiliates of our General Partner may compete with us.\nOur partnership agreement provides that our General Partner is restricted from engaging in any business activities other than acting as our General Partner, engaging in those activities incidental to its ownership interest in us and providing management, advisory and administrative services to its affiliates or to other persons. However, affiliates of our General Partner, including our sponsor, are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities, including those that might be in direct competition with us. In addition, our sponsor may compete with us for investment opportunities and may own an interest in entities that compete with us.\nPursuant to the terms of our partnership agreement, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, does not apply to our General Partner or any of its affiliates, including its executive officers and directors and our sponsor. Any such person or entity that becomes aware of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for us will not have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to us. Any such person or entity will not be liable to us or to any limited partner for breach of any fiduciary duty or other duty by reason of the fact that such person or entity pursues or acquires such opportunity for itself, directs such opportunity to another person or entity or does not communicate such opportunity or information to us. This may create actual and potential conflicts of interest between us and affiliates of our General Partner and result in less than favorable treatment of us and our unitholders.\nThe holder or holders of our incentive distribution rights may elect to cause us to issue common units to it in connection with a resetting of the incentive distribution without the approval of our unitholders. This election may result in lower distributions to our common unitholders in certain situations.\nThe holder or holders of a majority of our incentive distribution rights (currently our sponsor) have the right, at any time when we have made cash distributions in excess of the then-applicable third target distribution for each of the prior four consecutive fiscal quarters, to reset the initial target distribution levels at higher levels based on our cash distribution levels at the time of the exercise of the reset election. Following a reset election, a baseline distribution amount will be calculated equal to an amount equal to the prior cash distribution per common unit for the fiscal quarter immediately preceding the reset election (such amount is referred to as the \u201creset minimum quarterly distribution\u201d), and the target distribution levels will be reset to correspondingly higher levels based on percentage increases above the reset minimum quarterly distribution. In addition, in connection with a reset election, the holders of our incentive distribution rights would receive a number of newly issued common units based on the value of cash distributions paid in respect of the incentive distribution rights in the quarter preceding the reset election.\nWe anticipate that our sponsor would exercise this reset right in order to facilitate acquisitions or internal growth projects that would not be sufficiently accretive to cash distributions per unit without such conversion. However, our sponsor may transfer the incentive distribution rights at any time. It is possible that our sponsor or a transferee could exercise this reset election at a time when we are experiencing declines in our aggregate cash distributions or at a time when the holders of the incentive distribution rights expect that we will experience declines in our aggregate cash distributions in the foreseeable future. In such situations, the holders of the incentive distribution rights may be experiencing, or may expect to experience, declines in the cash distributions they receive related to the incentive distribution rights and may therefore desire to be issued our common units, which are entitled to specified priorities with respect to our distributions and which therefore may be more advantageous for them to own in lieu of the right to receive incentive distribution payments based on target distribution levels that are less certain to be achieved. As a result, a reset election may cause our common unitholders to experience dilution in the amount of cash distributions that they would have otherwise received had we not issued new common units to the holders of the incentive distribution rights in connection with resetting the target distribution levels.\nOur sponsor has certain incentive distribution rights that reduce the amount of our cash available for distribution to our common unitholders.\nOur sponsor currently holds incentive distribution rights that entitle it to receive an increasing percentage (15%, 25% and 50%) of the cash that we distribute to our common unitholders from available cash after the minimum quarterly distribution and certain target distribution levels have been achieved. The maximum distribution right for our sponsor to receive 50% of any distributions paid to our common unitholders does not include any distributions that our sponsor may receive on common units it owns. Effective as of our quarterly cash distribution in the fourth quarter of 2017, our sponsor was at the top tier of the incentive distribution rights scale. Given that a higher percentage of our cash flows is allocated to our sponsor due to these incentive distribution rights, it may be more difficult for us to increase the amount of distributions to our unitholders and our cost of capital may be higher, making investments, capital expenditures and acquisitions, and therefore, future growth, by us potentially more costly, and in some cases, potentially prohibitively so.\nHolders of our common units have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our General Partner or its directors.\nCompared to the holders of common stock in a corporation, unitholders have limited voting rights and, therefore, limited ability to influence management\u2019s decisions regarding our business. Unitholders have no right on an annual or ongoing basis to elect our General Partner or its board of directors. The board of directors of our General Partner, including the independent directors, is chosen entirely by our sponsor, as a result of it owning our General Partner, and not by our unitholders. Unlike publicly traded corporations, we do not hold annual meetings of our unitholders to elect directors or consider other matters routinely addressed at annual meetings of stockholders of corporations.\nAs a result of these limitations, the price at which the common units trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price.\nEven if holders of our common units are dissatisfied, they cannot currently remove our General Partner without our sponsor\u2019s consent.\nIf our unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our General Partner, they have limited ability to remove our General Partner. Unitholders are currently unable to remove our General Partner without our sponsor\u2019s consent because our sponsor and its affiliates own sufficient units to be able to prevent its removal. The vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of all outstanding common units is required to remove our General Partner. As of February 14, 2021, our sponsor owned approximately 34% of our common units. This condition would enable our sponsor to prevent the removal of our General Partner.\nOur partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning 20% or more of our common units.\nOur partnership agreement restricts unitholders\u2019 voting rights by providing that any units held by a person or group that owns 20% or more of any class of units then outstanding, other than our General Partner and its affiliates, their transferees and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of the board of directors of our General Partner, cannot vote on any matter.\nOur general partner interest or the control of our General Partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.\nOur General Partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party without the consent of our unitholders. Furthermore, our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of the owner of our General Partner to transfer its membership interests in our General Partner to a third party. The new owner of our General Partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and executive officers of our General Partner with its own designees and thereby exert significant control over the decisions taken by the board of directors and executive officers of our General Partner. This effectively permits a \u201cchange of control\u201d without the vote or consent of the unitholders.\nThe incentive distribution rights may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.\nOur sponsor may transfer the incentive distribution rights to a third party at any time without the consent of our unitholders. If our sponsor transfers the incentive distribution rights to a third party, our sponsor would not have the same incentive to grow our partnership and increase quarterly distributions to unitholders over time. For example, a transfer of incentive distribution rights by our sponsor could reduce the likelihood of our sponsor accepting offers made by us relating to assets owned by our sponsor, as it would have less of an economic incentive to grow our business, which would impact our ability to grow our asset base.\nOur General Partner has a call right that may require unitholders to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price.\nIf at any time our General Partner and its affiliates own more than 80% of the common units, our General Partner will have the right, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, but not the obligation, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price equal to the greater of (1) the average of the daily closing price of the common units over the 20 trading days preceding the date three days before notice of exercise of the call right is first mailed and (2) the highest per-unit price paid by our General Partner or any of its affiliates for common units during the 90-day period preceding the date such notice is first mailed. As a result, unitholders may be required to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return or a negative return on their investment. Unitholders may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of their units. Our General Partner is not obligated to obtain a fairness opinion regarding the value of the common units to be repurchased by it upon exercise of the call right. There is no restriction in our partnership agreement that prevents our General Partner from causing us to issue additional common units and then exercising its call right. If our General Partner exercised its call right, the effect would be to take us private and, if the units were subsequently deregistered, we would no longer be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.\nWe may issue additional units without unitholder approval, which would dilute existing unitholder ownership interests.\nOur partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional limited partner interests we may issue at any time without the approval of our unitholders. The issuance of additional common units or other equity interests of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:\n\u2022our existing unitholders\u2019 proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;\n\u2022the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease;\n\u2022the ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase;\n\u2022the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished; and\n\u2022the market price of the common units may decline.\nThere are no limitations in our partnership agreement on our ability to issue units ranking senior to the common units.\nIn accordance with Delaware law and the provisions of our partnership agreement, we may issue additional partnership interests that are senior to the common units in right of distribution, liquidation and voting. The issuance by us of units of senior rank may (1) reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for distribution to our common unitholders; (2) diminish the relative voting strength of the total common units outstanding as a class; or (3) subordinate the claims of the common unitholders to our assets in the event of our liquidation.\nThe market price of our common units could be adversely affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common units in the public or private markets, including sales by our sponsor or other large holders.\nOur sponsor owns approximately 34% of our common units. Sales by our sponsor or other large holders of a substantial number of our common units in the public markets, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common units or could impair our ability to obtain capital through an offering of equity securities.\nCost reimbursements due to our General Partner and its affiliates for services provided to us or on our behalf will reduce cash available for distribution to our unitholders. The amount and timing of such reimbursements will be determined by our General Partner.\nUnder the MSAs, we are obligated to reimburse our sponsor for all direct or indirect costs and expenses incurred by, or chargeable to, our sponsor in connection with its provision of services necessary for the operation of our business. If the MSAs were terminated without replacement, or our General Partner or its affiliates provided services outside of the scope of the MSAs, our partnership agreement would require us to reimburse our General Partner and its affiliates for all expenses they incur and payments they make on our behalf. Our partnership agreement does not set a limit on the amount of expenses for which our General Partner and its affiliates may be reimbursed. These expenses include salary, bonus, incentive compensation and other amounts paid to persons who perform services for us or on our behalf and expenses allocated to our General Partner by its affiliates. Our partnership agreement provides that our General Partner determines the expenses that are allocable to us. The reimbursement of expenses and payment of fees, if any, to our General Partner and its affiliates will reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders.\nThe price of our common units may fluctuate significantly and unitholders could lose all or part of their investment.\nThe market price of our common units may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including our results of operations and financial condition, the amount of our quarterly distributions, changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles, general economic conditions, the failure of securities analysts to\ncover our common units or changes in financial estimates by analysts, future sales of our common units and the other factors described in these \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nUnitholders may have liability to repay distributions.\nUnder certain circumstances, unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them. Under Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, we may not make a distribution to our unitholders if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets. Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of the impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to us for the distribution amount. Liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities that are non-recourse to us are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted.\nThe New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d) does not require a publicly traded partnership like us to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements.\nOur common units are listed on the NYSE. Because we are a publicly traded partnership, the NYSE does not require us to have a majority of independent directors on our General Partner\u2019s board of directors or to establish a compensation committee or a nominating and corporate governance committee. Accordingly, unitholders do not have the same protections afforded to certain corporations that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements. Please read Part III, Item 10. \u201cDirectors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance-Director Independence.\u201d\nTax Risks to Common Unitholders\nOur tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and not being subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation. If the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, or we become subject to entity-level taxation for state tax purposes, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced.\nThe anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.\nDespite the fact that we are organized as a limited partnership under Delaware law, we would be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless we satisfy a \u201cqualifying income\u201d requirement. Based on our current operations and current Treasury Regulations, we believe we satisfy the qualifying income requirement. We have requested and obtained a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS to the effect that, based on facts presented in the private letter ruling request, our income from processing timber feedstocks into pellets and transporting, storing, marketing and distributing such timber feedstocks and wood pellets constitute \u201cqualifying income\u201d within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \u201cCode\u201d). However, no ruling has been, and we expect none will be, requested regarding our treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Failing to meet the qualifying income requirement or a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity.\nIf we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate. Distributions to our unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses or deductions would flow through to our unitholders. Because a tax would be imposed on us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders would be substantially reduced. Therefore, treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to the unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units.\nOur partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity-level taxation for U.S. federal, state or local or foreign income tax purposes, the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law or interpretation on us. At the state level, several states have been evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise or other forms of taxation. Specifically, we currently own assets and conduct business in Mississippi, North Carolina, Florida, Virginia, Georgia and South Carolina, each of which imposes a margin or franchise tax. In the future, we may expand our operations. Imposition of a similar tax on us in other jurisdictions that we may expand to could substantially reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders.\nThe tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes or differing interpretations, possibly applied on a retroactive basis.\nThe present U.S. federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial changes or differing interpretations at any time. Members of Congress have frequently proposed and considered substantive changes to the existing U.S. federal income tax laws that affect publicly traded partnerships. Although there is no current legislative proposal to eliminate the qualifying income exception upon which we rely for our treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, current and former legislative proposals would have eliminated the qualifying income exception for publicly traded partnerships relying on qualifying income from fossil fuel activities. In addition, the Treasury Department has issued, and in the future may issue, regulations interpreting those laws that affect publicly traded partnerships. We believe we qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes under current regulations.\nHowever, any modification to the U.S. federal income tax laws may be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible for us to meet the exception for certain publicly traded partnerships to be treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict whether any of these changes or other proposals will ultimately be enacted. Any similar or future legislative changes could increase our entity-level tax burden and negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units. You are urged to consult with your own tax advisor with respect to the status of regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on your investment in our common units.\nIf the IRS were to contest the federal income tax positions we take, it may adversely impact the market for our common units, and the costs of any such contest would reduce cash available for distribution to our unitholders.\nWe have requested and obtained a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS to the effect that, based on facts presented in the private letter ruling request, our income from processing timber feedstocks into pellets and transporting, storing, marketing and distributing such timber feedstocks and wood pellets will constitute \u201cqualifying income\u201d within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code. However, no ruling has been, and we expect none will be, requested regarding our treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The IRS may adopt positions that differ from the positions we take. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take. A court may not agree with some or all of the positions we take. Any contest with the IRS may materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the price at which they trade. Moreover, the costs of any contest between us and the IRS will result in a reduction in cash available for distribution to our unitholders and thus will be borne indirectly by our unitholders.\nIf the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, it (and some states) may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustments directly from us, in which case we may require our unitholders and former unitholders to reimburse us for such taxes (including any applicable penalties or interest) or, if we are required to bear such payments, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced.\nPursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns, it (and some states) may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustment directly from us. To the extent possible under the new rules, our General Partner may elect to either pay the taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly to the IRS or, if we are eligible, issue a revised information statement to each unitholder and former unitholder with respect to an audited and adjusted return, which statement reports the items adjusted and certain other amounts. Although our General Partner may elect to have our unitholders and former unitholders take such audit adjustment into account and pay any resulting taxes (including applicable penalties and interest) in accordance with their interests in us during the tax year under audit, there can be no assurance that such election will be practical, permissible or effective in all circumstances. As a result, our current unitholders may bear some or all of the tax liability resulting from such audit adjustment, even if such unitholders did not own units in us during the tax year under audit. If, as a result of any such audit adjustment, we are required to make payments of taxes, penalties and interest, we may require our unitholders and former unitholders to reimburse us for such taxes (including any applicable penalties or interest) or, if we are required to bear such payments, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced. These rules are not applicable for tax years beginning on or prior to December 31, 2017.\nEven if unitholders do not receive any cash distributions from us, unitholders will be required to pay taxes on their share of our taxable income.\nUnitholders are required to pay federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes, on unitholders\u2019 share of our taxable income, whether or not they receive cash distributions from us. For example, if we sell assets and use the proceeds to repay existing debt or fund capital expenditures, you may be allocated taxable income and gain resulting from the sale, and our cash available for distribution would not increase. Similarly, taking advantage of opportunities to reduce our existing debt, such as debt exchanges, debt repurchases, or modifications of our existing debt could result in \u201ccancellation of indebtedness income\u201d being allocated to our unitholders as taxable income without any increase in our cash available for\ndistribution. Unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax due from them with respect to that income.\nA tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be more or less than unitholders expect.\nIf unitholders sell their common units, they will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and their tax basis in those common units. Because distributions in excess of unitholders\u2019 allocable share of our net taxable income decrease their tax basis in their common units, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to the units unitholders sell will, in effect, become taxable income to our unitholders if they sell such units at a price greater than their tax basis in those units, even if the price they receive is less than their original cost. In addition, because the amount realized includes a unitholder\u2019s share of our nonrecourse liabilities, if they sell their units, unitholders may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash they receive from the sale.\nFurthermore, a substantial portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing gain, may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture items, including depreciation recapture. Thus, you may recognize both ordinary income and capital loss from the sale of your units if the amount realized on a sale of your units is less than your adjusted basis in the units. Net capital loss may only offset capital gains and, in the case of individuals, up to $3,000 of ordinary income per year. In the taxable period in which you sell your units, you may recognize ordinary income from our allocations of income and gain to you prior to the sale and from recapture items that generally cannot be offset by any capital loss recognized upon the sale of units.\nTax-exempt entities face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.\nInvestment in our common units by tax-exempt entities, such as employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts (known as IRAs), raises issues unique to them. For example, virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax, including IRAs and other retirement plans, will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them. Any tax-exempt entity should consult its tax advisor before investing in our common units.\nUnitholders may be subject to limitation on their ability to deduct interest expense incurred by us.\nHistorically, we have been entitled to a full deduction for interest paid or accrued on indebtedness properly allocable to our trade or business during our taxable year. However, subject to certain exceptions in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act, discussed below),under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law in December 2017, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, our deduction for \u201cbusiness interest\u201d is limited to the sum of our business interest income and 30% of our \u201cadjusted taxable income.\u201d For the purposes of this limitation, our adjusted taxable income is computed without regard to any business interest expense or business interest income, and in the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 2022, any deduction allowable for depreciation, amortization or depletion. As a result, we expect that a substantial portion of our business interest deduction may be limited.\nFor the 2020 taxable year, the CARES Act generally increases the 30% adjusted taxable income limitation to 50%. For purposes of determining the 50% adjusted taxable income limitation, partnerships may substitute their 2020 adjusted taxable income with their 2019 adjusted taxable income, which may result in a greater business interest expense deduction. In addition, unitholders may treat 50% of any excess business interest allocated to them in 2019 as deductible in the 2020 taxable year without regard to the 2020 business interest expense limitation. The remaining 50% of such unitholder\u2019s excess business interest is carried forward and subject to the same limitations as other taxable years.\nNon-U.S. Unitholders will be subject to U.S. taxes and withholding with respect to their income and gain from owning our units.\nNon-U.S. unitholders are generally taxed and subject to income tax filing requirements by the United States on income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. Income allocated to our unitholders and any gain from the sale of our units will generally be considered to be \u201ceffectively connected\u201d with a U.S. trade or business. As a result, distributions to a non-U.S. unitholder will be subject to withholding at the highest applicable effective tax rate and a non-U.S. unitholder who sells or otherwise disposes of a unit will also be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the gain realized from the sale or disposition of such unit.\nMoreover, the transferee of an interest in a partnership that is engaged in a U.S. trade or business is generally required to withhold 10% of the amount realized by the transferor unless the transferor certifies that it is not a foreign person. While the determination of a partner\u2019s amount realized generally includes any decrease of a partner\u2019s share of the partnership\u2019s liabilities, recently issued Treasury regulations provide that the \u201camount realized\u201d on a transfer of an interest in a publicly traded partnership, such as our common units, will generally be the amount of gross proceeds paid to the broker effecting the applicable transfer on behalf of the transferor, and thus will be determined without regard to any decrease in that partner\u2019s share of a publicly traded partnership\u2019s liabilities. The Treasury regulations further provide that withholding on a transfer of an\ninterest in a publicly traded partnership will not be imposed on a transfer that occurs prior to January 1, 2022. For a transfer of interests in a publicly traded partnership that is effected through a broker on or after January 1, 2022, the obligation to withhold is imposed on the transferor\u2019s broker. Prospective foreign unitholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the impact of these rules on an investment in our common units.\nWe treat each purchaser of our common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the common units.\nBecause we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units, we have adopted certain methods for allocating depreciation and amortization deductions that may not conform to all aspects of existing Treasury Regulations. A successful IRS challenge to the use of those methods could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to our unitholders. It also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from our unitholders\u2019 sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to their tax returns.\nWe generally prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based on the ownership of our units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.\nWe generally prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based on the ownership of our units on the first day of each month (the \u201cAllocation Date\u201d), instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. Similarly, we generally allocate certain deductions for depreciation of capital additions, gain or loss realized on a sale or other disposition of our assets and, in the discretion of our General Partner, any other extraordinary item of income, gain, loss or deduction based on ownership on the Allocation Date. Treasury Regulations allow a similar monthly simplifying convention, but such regulations do not specifically authorize all aspects of our proration method. If the IRS were to challenge our proration method, we may be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.\nA unitholder whose units are the subject of a securities loan (e.g., a loan to a \u201cshort seller\u201d to cover a short sale of units) may be considered as having disposed of those units. If so, he would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition.\nBecause there are no specific rules governing the U.S. federal income tax consequence of loaning a partnership interest, a unitholder whose units are the subject of a securities loan may be considered as having disposed of the loaned units. In that case, the unitholder may no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition. Moreover, during the period of the loan, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those units could be fully taxable as ordinary income. Unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a securities loan are urged to consult a tax advisor to determine whether it is advisable to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their units.\nWe have adopted certain valuation methodologies in determining a unitholder\u2019s allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction. The IRS may challenge these methodologies or the resulting allocations, which could adversely affect the value of the common units.\nIn determining the items of income, gain, loss and deduction allocable to our unitholders, we must routinely determine the fair market value of our assets. Although we may, from time to time, consult with professional appraisers regarding valuation matters, we make many fair market value estimates using a methodology based on the market value of our common units as a means to measure the fair market value of our assets. The IRS may challenge these valuation methods and the resulting allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction.\nA successful IRS challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the timing or amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to our unitholders. It also could affect the amount of gain from our unitholders\u2019 sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders\u2019 tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions.\nOur unitholders will likely be subject to state and local taxes and income tax return filing requirements in jurisdictions where they do not live as a result of investing in our common units.\nIn addition to U.S. federal income taxes, our unitholders may be subject to other taxes, including foreign, state and local taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in\nwhich we conduct business or own property now or in the future, even if they do not live in any of those jurisdictions. Our unitholders will likely be required to file foreign, state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions. Further, our unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements.\nWe currently own assets in multiple states. Many of these states currently impose a personal income tax on individuals, corporations and other entities. As we make acquisitions or expand our business, we may own assets or conduct business in additional states that impose a personal income tax. It is our unitholders\u2019 responsibility to file all U.S. federal, foreign, state and local tax returns and pay any resulting taxes due in these jurisdictions. Unitholders should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the filing of such tax returns, the payment of such taxes, and the deductibility of any such taxes paid.", "PERMNO": 15313, "SIC": 2400, "TIC": "EVA"}
