Risk Factors\nThis report contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of U.S. federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are all statements other than statements of historical facts, such as projections or expectations related to operational and financial performance, reimbursements for infrastructure costs, financing and regulatory matters, development plans and sales of land, units and lots, commercial leasing activities, timeframes for development, construction and completion of our projects, capital expenditures, liquidity and capital resources, results of our business strategy, and other plans and objectives of management for future operations and activities. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include, without limitation, the following:\nRisks Relating to our Business and Industries\nWe need significant amounts of cash to service our debt. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash to service our debt, our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nOur business strategy requires us to rely on cash flow from operations and our debt agreements as our primary sources of funding for our liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2014, our outstanding debt totaled $196.5 million and our cash and cash equivalents totaled $29.6 million, of which $11.6 million is available to Stratus, $17.3 million is available to our joint venture with Canyon-Johnson and $0.7 million is available to our joint venture with LCHM Holdings. Our level of indebtedness could have significant consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse changes in economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations and proceeds from asset sales to pay or provide for our indebtedness, thus reducing the availability of cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and the market in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow money to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and other financing needs.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $40.4 million of debt scheduled to become due during 2015. Historically, much of our debt has been renewed or refinanced in the ordinary course of business. However, in the future we may not be able to obtain sufficient external sources of liquidity on attractive terms, if at all, or otherwise renew, extend or refinance a significant portion of our outstanding debt scheduled to become due in the near future. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will maintain cash reserves and generate sufficient cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. Any of these occurrences may have a material, adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness include restrictive covenants and require that certain financial ratios be maintained. For example, the minimum stockholders' equity covenant contained in most of our debt agreements requires us to maintain total stockholders\u2019 equity of no less than $110.0 million. At December 31, 2014, our total stockholders\u2019 equity was $136.4 million and was in compliance with this covenant. Failure to comply with this covenant could result in a default that may, if not cured, accelerate the payment under such debt which would likely have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn order to maintain compliance with the covenants in our debt agreements and carry out our business plan, we may need to raise additional capital through equity transactions or obtain waivers or modifications of covenants from our lenders. Such additional funding may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, at such time. We also may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business to fund our development projects and our operations. There can be no assurance that such additional financing would be available or, if available, offered on acceptable terms. If new debt is added to current debt levels, the risks described above could intensify.\nWe are vulnerable to concentration risks because our operations are almost exclusive to the Austin, Texas market.\nOur real estate operations are primarily, and our hotel and entertainment venue operations are entirely, located in Austin, Texas. Because of our geographic concentration and limited number of projects, our operations are more vulnerable to local economic downturns and adverse project-specific risks than those of larger, more diversified companies. The performance of the Austin economy greatly affects our sales and consequently the underlying values of our properties. Our geographic concentration may create increased vulnerability during regional economic downturns, which can significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and, accordingly, our business could be harmed by any slowdown or deterioration in the economy.\nPeriods of economic weakness or recession; significantly rising interest rates; declining employment levels; declining demand for real estate; declining real estate values; conditions which negatively shape public perception of travel, including travel-related accidents, the financial condition of the airline, automotive and other transportation-related industries; or the public perception that any of these events or conditions may occur or be present, may negatively affect our business. These economic conditions can result in a general decline in acquisition, disposition and leasing activity, demand for hotel rooms and related lodging services, a general decline in the value of real estate and in rents, which in turn reduces revenue derived from property sales and leases and hotel operations as well as revenues associated with development activities. These conditions also can lead to a decline in property sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in existing commercial real estate and related assets and properties planned for development. In addition, during periods of economic slowdown and recession, many consumers have historically reduced their discretionary spending, and our entertainment businesses depend on discretionary consumer and corporate spending. A reduction in consumer spending historically is accompanied by a decrease in attendance at live entertainment, sporting and leisure events, which may result in reductions in ticket sales, sponsorship opportunities and our ability to generate revenue with our entertainment businesses.\nDuring an economic downturn, investment capital is usually constrained and it may take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments. As a result, the value of our real estate investments may be reduced and we could realize losses or diminished profitability. If economic and market conditions decline, our business performance and profitability could deteriorate. If this were to occur, we could fail to comply with certain financial covenants in our debt agreements, which would force us to seek amendments with our lenders. No assurance can be given that we would be able to obtain any necessary waivers or amendments on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nChanges in weather conditions or natural disasters could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur performance may be adversely affected by weather conditions. For our real estate operations, adverse weather may delay development or damage property, resulting in substantial repair or replacement costs to the extent not covered by insurance, a reduction in property values, or a loss of revenue, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our competitors may be affected differently by such changes in weather conditions or natural disasters depending on the location of their supplies or operations. Adverse weather conditions also may affect our live music events. Due to weather conditions, we may be required to reschedule an event to another available day, which would increase our costs for the event and could negatively affect the attendance at the event, as well as concession and merchandise sales, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate to cover any losses we may incur.\nWe maintain insurance on our properties, including property, liability, fire and extended coverage. However, there are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as hurricanes and floods or acts of war or terrorism that may be uninsurable or not economical to insure. We use our discretion when determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibles for insurance. These terms are determined based on retaining an acceptable level of risk at a reasonable cost. This may result in insurance coverage that in the event of a substantial loss would not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of our lost investment. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors also may make it unfeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building or other facility after it has been damaged or destroyed.\nUnder such circumstances, the insurance proceeds we receive may be inadequate to restore our economic position in a property.\nRisks Relating to Real Estate Operations\nThe real estate business is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and financially stronger than we are.\nThe real estate business is highly competitive. We compete with a large number of companies and individuals that have significantly greater financial, sales, marketing and other resources than we have. Our competitors include local developers who are committed primarily to particular markets and also national developers who acquire properties throughout the U.S. A downturn in the real estate industry could significantly increase competition among developers. Increased competition could cause us to increase our selling incentives and/or reduce our prices. An oversupply of real estate properties available for sale or lease, as well as the potential significant discounting of prices by some of our competitors, may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe currently participate in five joint ventures and may participate in other joint ventures in the future. We could be adversely affected if any of our joint venture partners fail to fulfill their obligations or if we have disagreements with any of our joint venture partners that are not satisfactorily resolved.\nWe currently have investments in and commitments to five joint ventures and we may participate in other joint ventures in the future. Under existing joint venture agreements, we and our joint venture partners could be required to, among other things, provide guarantees of obligations or contribute additional capital until specified capital contribution requirements are met and we may have little or no control over the amount or timing of these obligations. In some circumstances, decisions of the joint venture are made by unanimous vote of the partners. If our joint venture partners are unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations or if we have any unresolved disagreements with our joint venture partners, we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone, expend additional resources to continue development of projects or delay further construction of projects, or we may be required to write down our investments at amounts that could be significant.\nOur participation in our current joint ventures and/or joint ventures in the future could subject us to certain risks, other than or in addition to the risk of non-performance by and/or disagreements with our joint venture partners, which may not otherwise be present, including:\n\u2022\nthe joint venture partner may have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with or adverse to our interests or goals or the goals of the joint venture;\n\u2022\nthe joint venture partner may take actions contrary to our requests or instructions or contrary to our objectives or policies;\n\u2022\nthe joint venture partner might become bankrupt or fail to fund its share of required capital contributions; and\n\u2022\nwe may become liable for the actions of our third-party joint venture partners.\nAny unresolved disputes that may arise between joint venture partners and us may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent us from focusing our time and effort on the business of the joint ventures or our other businesses.\nOur results of operations, cash flows and financial condition are greatly affected by the performance of the real estate industry.\nRevenue from our real estate operations segment accounted for 28 percent of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. The U.S. real estate industry is highly cyclical and is affected by changes in global, national and local economic conditions and events such as general employment and income levels, availability of financing, interest rates, consumer confidence and overbuilding of or decrease in demand for residential and commercial real estate. Our real estate activities are subject to numerous factors beyond our control, including local real estate market conditions (both where our properties are located and in areas where our potential customers reside), substantial existing and potential competition, general national, regional and local economic conditions,\nfluctuations in interest rates and mortgage availability, changes in demographic conditions and changes in government regulations or requirements. Any of the foregoing factors could result in a reduction or cancellation of sales and/or lower gross margins for sales. Lower than expected sales could have a material adverse effect on the level of our profits and the timing and amounts of our cash flows.\nReal estate investments often cannot easily be converted into cash and market values may be adversely affected by these economic circumstances, market fundamentals, and competitive and demographic conditions. Because of the effect these factors have on real estate values, it is difficult to predict the level of future sales or sales prices that will be realized for individual assets.\nOur operations are subject to an intensive regulatory approval process and opposition from environmental groups, either or both of which could cause delays and increase the costs of our development efforts or preclude such developments entirely.\nBefore we can develop a property, we must obtain a variety of approvals from local and state governments with respect to such matters as zoning and other land use issues, and subdivision, site planning and environmental issues under applicable regulations. Some of these approvals are discretionary. Because government agencies and special interest groups have in the past expressed concerns about our development plans in or near Austin, our ability to develop these properties and realize future income from our properties could be delayed, reduced, prevented or made more expensive.\nSeveral special interest groups have in the past opposed our plans in the Austin area and have taken various actions to partially or completely restrict development in some areas, including areas where some of our most valuable properties are located. We have actively opposed these actions. However, because of the regulatory environment that has existed in the Austin area and the opposition of these special interest groups, there can be no assurance that an unfavorable ruling would not have a significant long-term adverse effect on the overall value of our property holdings.\nOur operations are subject to environmental regulation, which can change at any time and could increase our costs.\nReal estate development is subject to state and federal environmental regulations and to possible interruption or termination because of environmental considerations, including, without limitation, air and water quality and protection of endangered species and their habitats.\nCertain of the Barton Creek and Lantana properties include nesting territories for the Golden-cheeked Warbler, a federally listed endangered species. In 1995, we received a permit from the U.S. Wildlife Service pursuant to the Endangered Species Act, which to date has allowed the development of the Barton Creek and Lantana properties free of restrictions under the Endangered Species Act related to the maintenance of habitat for the Golden-cheeked Warbler.\nAdditionally, in April 1997, the U.S. Department of Interior listed the Barton Springs Salamander as an endangered species after a federal court overturned a March 1997 decision by the Department of Interior not to list the Barton Springs Salamander based on a conservation agreement between the State of Texas and federal agencies. The listing of the Barton Springs Salamander has not affected, nor do we anticipate it will affect, our Barton Creek and Lantana properties for several reasons, including the results of technical studies and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 10(a) permit obtained by us in 1995. The development permitted by the 2002 Circle C settlement with the City has been reviewed and approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and, as a result, we also do not anticipate that the 1997 listing of the Barton Springs Salamander will affect our Circle C properties.\nIn January 2013, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced that it had conducted an economic assessment of the potential designation of critical habitat for four species of Central Texas salamanders. Although this potential designation of habitat has not affected, nor do we anticipate that it will affect, our Barton Creek, Lantana or Circle C properties for several reasons, including prior studies and approvals, and our existing U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 10(a) permit obtained in 1995, future endangered species listings or habitat designations could impact development of our properties.\nWe are making, and will continue to make, expenditures with respect to our real estate development for the protection of the environment. Emphasis on environmental matters will result in additional costs in the future. New\nenvironmental regulations or changes in existing regulations or their enforcement may be enacted and such new regulations or changes may require significant expenditures by us. The recent trend toward stricter standards in environmental legislation and regulations is likely to continue and could have a material adverse effect on our operating costs.\nRisks Relating to Hotel Operations\nWe are subject to the business, financial and operating risks common to the hotel industry, any of which could reduce our revenues.\nRevenue from our hotel segment accounted for 45 percent of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. Business, financial and operating risks common to the hotel industry include:\n\u2022\nchanges in desirability of geographic regions and geographic concentration of our operations and customers;\n\u2022\ndecreases in the demand for hotel rooms and related lodging services, including a reduction in business travel as a result of alternatives to in-person meetings (including virtual meetings hosted online or over private teleconferencing networks) or due to general economic conditions;\n\u2022\ndecreased corporate or governmental travel-related budgets and spending, as well as cancellations, deferrals or renegotiations of group business such as industry conventions;\n\u2022\nnegative public perception of corporate travel-related activities;\n\u2022\nthe effect of internet intermediaries and other new industry entrants on pricing and our increasing reliance on technology;\n\u2022\nthe costs and administrative burdens associated with complying with applicable laws and regulations in the U.S., including health, safety and environmental laws, rules and regulations and other governmental and regulatory action;\n\u2022\nchanges in operating costs including, but not limited to, energy, water, labor costs (including the effect of labor shortages and unionization), food costs, workers\u2019 compensation and health-care related costs, insurance and unanticipated costs such as acts of nature and their consequences; and\n\u2022\ncyclical over-building in the hotel industry.\nExternal perception of the W Austin Hotel could negatively affect our results of operations.\nStarwood manages hotel operations at the W Austin Hotel. Our ability to attract and retain guests depends, in part, upon the external perceptions of Starwood and the quality of the W Austin Hotel and its services. We believe that recognition of the Starwood brand gives us a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining guests; however, there is a risk to the reputation of the W Austin Hotel if Starwood fails to act responsibly or comply with regulatory requirements in a number of areas, such as safety and security, sustainability, responsible tourism, environmental management, human rights and support for the local communities where Starwood manages and/or owns properties. The considerable increase in the use of social media over recent years has greatly expanded the potential scope and scale, and increased the rapidity of the dissemination of negative publicity that could be generated by any adverse incident or failure on the part of hotel operators. An adverse incident involving associates or guests and any media coverage resulting therefrom may cause a loss of consumer confidence in the Starwood brand which could negatively affect our results or operations.\nOur revenues, profits or market share could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively in the hotel industry in Austin.\nThe hotel industry in Austin is highly competitive. The W Austin Hotel competes for customers with other hotel and resort properties in Austin, ranging from national and international hotel brands to independent, local and regional hotel operators. We compete based on a number of factors, primarily including quality and consistency of rooms, restaurant and meeting facilities and services, attractiveness of location and price. Some of our competitors may\nhave substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we do, and if we are unable to successfully compete in these areas, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nCurrently, the Austin market has a limited number of high-end hotel accommodations. If hotel capacity is expanded by other hotel operators in Austin, competition will increase which could lead to an excess supply of hotel rooms in the Austin market, thereby causing Starwood to increase promotional incentives for hotel guests and/or reduce rates. Increased competition in the Austin market from new hotels or hotels that have recently undergone substantial renovation could have an adverse effect on occupancy, average daily rate and room revenue per available room.\nRisks Relating to Entertainment Businesses\nWe face intense competition in the live music industry, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue from our entertainment businesses accounted for 20 percent of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. Our entertainment businesses compete in a highly competitive industry, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue as a result of such competition. The live music industry competes with other forms of entertainment for consumers\u2019 discretionary spending and within this industry we compete with other venues to book artists. Our competitors compete with us for key employees who have relationships with popular music artists and that have a history of being able to book such artists for concerts and tours. These competitors may engage in more extensive development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential artists. Our competitors may develop services, advertising options or music venues that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve. It is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.\nOther variables related to our entertainment businesses that could adversely affect our financial performance by, among other things, leading to decreases in overall revenue, the number of sponsors, event attendance, ticket prices and fees or profit margins include:\n\u2022\nan increased level of competition for advertising dollars, which may lead to lower sponsorships as we attempt to retain advertisers or which may cause us to lose advertisers to our competitors offering better programs that we are unable or unwilling to match;\n\u2022\nunfavorable fluctuations in operating costs, which we may be unwilling or unable to pass through to our customers via ticket prices;\n\u2022\ncompetitors\u2019 offerings that may include more favorable terms than we do in order to obtain events for the venues they operate;\n\u2022\ntechnological changes and innovations that we are unable to adopt or are late in adopting that offer more attractive entertainment alternatives than we or other live entertainment providers currently offer, which may lead to a reduction in attendance at live events, a loss of ticket sales or lower ticket fees;\n\u2022\nother entertainment options available to our audiences that we do not offer;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions which could cause our consumers to reduce discretionary spending; and\n\u2022\nunfavorable changes in labor conditions which may require us to spend more to retain and attract key employees.\nThere is the risk of personal injuries and accidents in connection with our live music events, which could subject us to personal injury or other claims and increase our expenses, as well as reduce attendance at our live music events, causing a decrease in our revenue.\nThere are inherent risks involved with producing live music events. As a result, personal injuries and accidents have, and may, occur from time to time, which could subject us to claims and liabilities for personal injuries. Incidents in connection with our live music events at the Moody Theater or festival sites that we rent through our\njoint ventures could also result in claims or reduce attendance at our events, which could cause a decrease in our revenue or reduce our operating income. While we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient, in management\u2019s judgment, to protect us from material financial loss for personal injuries sustained by persons at our venues or events or accidents in the ordinary course of business, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances.\nRisks Relating to Commercial Leasing\nUnfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could negatively affect occupancy or rental rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAnother decline in the real estate market and economic conditions could significantly affect rental rates. Occupancy and rental rates in our market, in turn, could significantly affect our profitability and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations. The risks that could affect conditions in our market include the following:\n\u2022\nlocal conditions, such as oversupply of office space, a decline in the demand for office space or increased competition from other available office buildings;\n\u2022\nthe inability or unwillingness of tenants to pay their current rent or rent increases; and\n\u2022\ndeclines in market rental rates.\nWe cannot predict with certainty whether any of these conditions will occur or whether, and to what extent, they will have an adverse effect on our operations.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Shares of Our Common Stock\nOur common stock is thinly traded; therefore, our stock price may fluctuate more than the stock market as a whole.\nAs a result of the thin trading market for shares of our common stock, our stock price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole or the stock prices of similar companies. Without a larger public float, shares of our common stock will be less liquid than the shares of common stock of companies with broader public ownership, and as a result, the trading prices for shares of our common stock may be more volatile. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of shares of our common stock may have a greater effect on the trading price than would be the case if our public float were larger.", "PERMNO": 77790, "SIC": 7011, "TIC": "STRS"}
