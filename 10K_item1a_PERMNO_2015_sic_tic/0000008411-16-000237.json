These risks and uncertainties may affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as well as an investment in our common stock.\nOur business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, which is significantly impacted by the volatility in oil and natural gas prices.\nOur business depends on the conditions of the offshore oil and natural gas industry. Demand for our services depends on oil and natural gas industry exploration and production activity and expenditure levels, which are directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices. Oil and natural gas prices, and market expectations regarding potential changes to these prices, significantly affect oil and natural gas industry activity. Oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile, and have dropped significantly\nsince late 2014, with Brent recently trading around $50 per barrel as of October 2016. This lengthy decrease in oil prices has in turn caused a sustained decline in the demand for offshore drilling services. Operators have implemented significant declines in capital spending in their budgets, including the cancellation or deferral of existing programs, and are expected to maintain reduced budgets in 2017. These declines in capital spending levels, coupled with additional newbuild supply in recent years, have put significant pressure on day rates and utilization as opportunities for new drilling contracts have substantially decreased and the number of available rigs has increased. The lack of a meaningful recovery of oil and natural gas prices, and the potential for a prolonged delay in the future or further price reductions and volatility in oil and/or natural gas prices, could cause oil and gas companies to maintain historically low levels, or further reduce their overall level, of activity or spending, in which case demand for our services may further decline and revenues may be further adversely affected through lower rig utilization and/or lower day rates. Oil and natural gas prices are impacted by many factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe strength of the global economy;\n\u2022\nexpectations about future prices;\n\u2022\nthe ability of The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to set and maintain production levels and pricing;\n\u2022\nthe level of production by OPEC and non-OPEC countries;\n\u2022\ndomestic and international tax policies;\n\u2022\npolitical and military conflicts in oil producing regions or other geographical areas or acts of terrorism in the U.S. or elsewhere;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances;\n\u2022\nthe development and exploitation of alternative fuels;\n\u2022\nlocal and international political, economic and weather conditions; and\n\u2022\nenvironmental and other laws and governmental regulations regarding exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves.\nThe level of offshore exploration, development and production activity and the price for oil and natural gas is volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices may depress the levels of exploration, development and production activity. Furthermore, higher oil and natural gas prices in the future may not necessarily translate into increased activity, and even during periods of relatively high oil prices, companies exploring for oil and gas may cancel or curtail programs, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons. Advances in onshore exploration and development technologies, particularly with respect to onshore shale plays, could result in our clients allocating a higher percentage of their capital expenditure budgets to onshore exploration and production activities and less to offshore activities. These factors could cause our revenues and margins to decline, reduce day rates and utilization of our rigs and limit our future growth prospects and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur industry is subject to intense price competition and volatility.\nThe contract drilling business is highly competitive with numerous industry participants. Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Price competition is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job, although rig availability, the quality and technical capability of service and equipment and safety record are also factors. We compete with a number of offshore drilling contractors, many of which are substantially larger than we are and which may possess appreciably greater financial, other resources and assets than we do.\nThe industry in which we operate historically has been volatile, marked by periods of low demand, excess rig supply and low day rates, followed by periods of high demand, low rig availability and increasing day rates. Periods of low demand and excess rig supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in lower day rates and rigs being idled. We have and may in the future be required to idle rigs or accept lower-rate contracts in response to market conditions. Presently, there are numerous recently constructed ultra-deepwater vessels and high-specification jackups that have entered the market and more are under contract for construction. Many of these units do not have drilling contracts in place. The entry into service of these new units has increased and will continue to increase rig supply and could curtail a strengthening, or trigger a further reduction, in day rates and utilization. The deepwater market has experienced a decrease in marketed utilization which has led to lower day rates in 2016, which may continue at depressed levels or experience further downward pressure in 2017 and beyond. Any further increases in construction of new units or reduction in demand may accelerate the negative impact on day rates and utilization. In addition, rigs\nmay be relocated to markets in which we operate, which could result in or exacerbate excess rig supply which may lower day rates in those markets.\nWe may be required to record impairment charges with respect to our rigs.\nWe evaluate our property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss on our property and equipment may exist when the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. The significant decline in oil and gas prices and resulting reduction in spending by our customers, together with the over-supply of rigs, is contributing to a reduction in day rates and demand for our rigs, which may continue for some time. Prolonged periods of low utilization and day rates may result in the recognition of impairment charges on certain of our drilling rigs if future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, indicate that the carrying value of these rigs may not be recoverable.\nFor example, the Atwood Falcon completed the contract under which it was working in early March 2016. Based on the lack of contracting opportunities and the further deterioration of commodity prices, we determined that it was not likely that additional work would be obtained in the foreseeable future. Based on our analysis, we concluded that the Atwood Falcon and its materials and supplies were impaired as of December 31, 2015, and we wrote them down to their approximate salvage value. We recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $64.9 million. In the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded an additional $38.6 million impairment related to items of drilling equipment intended to support our current and future offshore drilling operations. We may make similar decisions and record additional impairments with regard to other drilling equipment or rigs whose contracts expire if we are unable to obtain additional work for such rigs. Currently, the Atwood Eagle, Atwood Mako, Atwood Manta, Atwood Orca, Atwood Beacon and Atwood Aurora are idled and are being actively marketed. Although we are actively marketing these rigs, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain future contracts for these rigs. As of September 30, 2016, we assessed these rigs and determined no impairment charge was necessary. These rigs and other rigs in our fleet may become impaired in the future if the current depressed market conditions are prolonged or if oil and gas prices decrease further.\nAt September 30, 2016, we performed impairment testing on our fleet of drilling rigs, including our two rigs currently under construction, which have an aggregate net book value of $4.0 billion. We concluded that the net book value of each drilling rig is recoverable through estimated future cash flows. The most significant assumptions used in our undiscounted cash flow model include: timing on awards of future drilling contracts, operating day rates, operating costs, capital expenditures, reactivation costs, drilling rig utilization, estimated remaining economic useful life and net proceeds received upon future sale/disposition. These significant assumptions are classified as Level 3 inputs by ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures as they are based upon unobservable inputs and primarily rely on management assumptions and forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions used in our analysis are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact the analysis and our resulting conclusion. Our oldest drilling rig may be subject to greater risk of future impairment if the significant assumptions on which we have based our impairment testing at September 30, 2016 do not materialize or if we change those assumptions in future periods as new market conditions may dictate.\nOur business relies heavily on a limited number of clients and a limited number of drilling units and the loss of a significant client, the loss of a rig, significant downtime for our rigs, or the inability of our clients to perform could materially and adversely impact our business.\nOur client base includes a small number of major and independent oil and gas companies as well as government-owned oil companies. In fiscal year 2016, five clients each accounted for over 10% of our operating revenues: Shell Offshore Inc. - 21%, Kosmos Energy Ltd. - 18%, Noble Energy Inc. - 18%, Chevron Australia Pty. Ltd. - 12% and Woodside Energy Ltd. - 11%. The contract drilling business is subject to the usual risks associated with having a limited number of clients for our services. Further, consolidation among oil and natural gas exploration and production companies may reduce the number of available clients. Our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if any of our major clients terminate their contracts with us, fail to renew our existing contracts, refuse to award new contracts to us or experience difficulties in obtaining financing to fund their drilling programs. We currently own 10 drilling units, of which four are currently in operation and six are idled and being actively marketed. In addition, we have two drilling units under construction and being actively marketed. As a result of the number of rigs in our fleet, if more of our drilling units were idled or if a client were unable to perform due to liquidity or solvency issues, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur clients may be unable or unwilling to fulfill their contractual commitments to us, including their obligations to pay for losses, damages or other liabilities resulting from operations under the contract.\nCertain of our clients are subject to liquidity or solvency risk and such risk could lead them to seek to repudiate, cancel or renegotiate our drilling contracts for various reasons or fail to fulfill their commitments to us under those contracts. These risks\nare heightened in periods of depressed market conditions. Our drilling contracts provide for varying levels of indemnification from our clients, including with respect to well control and subsurface risks. Our drilling contracts also provide for varying levels of indemnification and allocation of liabilities between our clients and us with respect to loss or damage to property and injury or death to persons arising from the drilling operations we perform. Under our drilling contracts, liability with respect to personnel and property customarily is generally allocated so that we and our clients each assume liability for our respective personnel and property. Our clients typically assume most of the responsibility for and indemnify us from any loss, damage or other liability resulting from pollution or contamination, including clean-up and removal, third-party damages, and fines and penalties arising from operations under the contract when the source of the pollution originates from the well or reservoir, including those resulting from blow-outs or cratering of the well. Notwithstanding a contractual indemnity from a client, there can be no assurance that our clients will be financially able to assume their responsibility, or honor their indemnity to us, for such losses. In addition, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, such indemnities are not enforceable if the cause of the damage was our gross negligence or willful misconduct. This could result in our having to assume liabilities not otherwise contemplated in our contracts.\nOur business may experience reduced profitability if our clients terminate, repudiate or seek to renegotiate our drilling contracts.\nCurrently, our contracts with clients are day rate contracts, in which we charge a fixed amount per day regardless of the number of days needed to drill the well. During depressed market conditions, a client may no longer need a rig that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain a comparable rig at a lower day rate. Clients may seek to reduce or avoid their obligations under their existing drilling contracts by seeking to renegotiate the terms or terminate the contract. In 2015, for example, we renegotiated drilling contracts with respect to several of our rigs. In March 2016, we negotiated with a client to shift its remaining contract backlog from the Atwood Eagle to the Atwood Osprey in order to preserve the continuity of operations for the Atwood Osprey. This shift in backlog did not alter the contractual day rate for the client, but it did lead to the immediate idling of the Atwood Eagle. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Market Outlook\u201d in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nIn addition, certain of our contracts may be canceled upon specified notice at the option of the client upon payment of an early termination fee, which is typically a majority of the full operating rate over the remainder of the contract term. Contracts also customarily provide for either automatic termination or termination at the option of the client in the event of total loss of the drilling rig, if a rig is not delivered to the client, if a rig does not pass acceptance testing within the period specified in the contract, if drilling operations are suspended for extended periods of time by reason of excessive rig downtime for repairs, or other specified conditions, including force majeure or failure to meet minimum performance criteria. Early termination of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time. The recent decline in oil prices, the perceived risk of a further decline in oil prices, and the resulting downward pressure on utilization is causing some operators to consider early termination of contracts despite having to pay onerous early termination fees in some cases.\nOur revenues may be adversely affected by the early termination of contracts, especially if we are unable to re-contract the affected rig within a short period of time. The termination or renegotiation of one or more of our drilling contracts could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business will be adversely affected if we are unable to secure contracts on economically favorable terms.\nThe drilling markets in which we compete frequently experience significant fluctuations in the demand for drilling services, as measured by the level of exploration and development expenditures and the supply of capable drilling equipment. The contracts for three of our four rigs currently in operation expire in fiscal year 2017, with no immediate follow-on work currently scheduled. Our ability to extend these contracts or obtain new contracts and the terms of any such contracts will depend on market conditions. We may be unable to extend our expiring contracts or obtain new contracts for the rigs under contracts that have expired or been terminated, and the day rates under any new contracts may be substantially below the existing day rates, which could materially reduce our revenues and profitability. We can, as we have done in the past, relocate drilling rigs from one geographic area to another, but only when such moves are economically justified, or we can idle rigs temporarily to save operating expenses, as we have done with the Atwood Eagle, Atwood Mako, Atwood Manta, Atwood Orca, Atwood Beacon and Atwood Aurora. If demand for our rigs declines, rig utilization and day rates are generally adversely affected, which in turn, would adversely affect our financial position, results or operations and cash flows.\nOur current backlog of contract drilling revenue may not be fully realized, and the periods which revenues are earned may vary.\nAs of September 30, 2016, our contract drilling backlog was approximately $0.8 billion for future revenues under firm commitments. The amount of actual revenues earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different from the amounts disclosed in our backlog calculations due to a lack of predictability of various factors, including newbuild rig\ndelivery dates, client-elected standby periods, unscheduled repairs, maintenance requirements, weather delays and other factors. Such factors may result in lower applicable day rates than the full contractual day rates and/or delays in receiving the full contractual operating rates.\nSome of our drilling contracts are cancellable at the option of the client upon payment of a termination fee which may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract. Our drilling contracts also customarily provide for either automatic termination or termination at the option of the client in the event of total loss of the drilling rig, if a rig is not timely delivered to the client, if a rig does not pass acceptance testing within the period specified in the contract, if drilling operations are suspended for extended periods of time, including excessive rig downtime for repairs, or other specified conditions, including force majeure or failure to meet minimum performance criteria. Our clients may seek to cancel or renegotiate our contracts for various reasons, or we may not be able to perform under our drilling contracts due to events beyond our control. In addition, some of our clients could experience liquidity or solvency issues or could otherwise be unable or unwilling to perform under the contract, which could ultimately lead a client to go into bankruptcy or to otherwise encourage a client to seek to repudiate, cancel or renegotiate a contract. Our inability or the inability of our clients to perform under our or their contractual obligations may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness or make payments on our rigs under construction, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness and construction contracts, which may not be successful.\nAt September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had $1.23 billion and $1.68 billion, respectively, of total long-term debt. In addition, we had remaining milestone payments for our rigs under construction totaling approximately $399.8 million. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our obligations depends on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions, including our ability to obtain new drilling contracts in the event our existing contracts expire or are terminated or our customers attempt to renegotiate terms, and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay our outstanding obligations. If we breach our covenants under our senior secured revolving credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a required waiver from the lenders. If this occurs, we would be in default under our Credit Facility, the lenders could exercise their rights and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. See \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Revolving Credit Facility.\u201d\nAs a result of our substantial level of debt and other obligations, we may be unable to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service obligations or for other purposes. In addition, if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our obligations, we may be forced to sell assets, seek additional capital, reduce or delay investment decisions and capital expenditures, restructure or refinance our indebtedness or take other measures. Furthermore, these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial position at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating. Certain credit rating agencies have recently downgraded the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt, and any further downgrades could harm our ability to seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. In addition, the terms of the agreements that govern our existing and future indebtedness may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. For example, the terms of our existing debt agreements restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds therefrom. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nCapital expenditures may be necessary to keep pace with the bifurcation of the drilling fleet and technological developments in our industry.\nThe market for our services is characterized by continual and rapid technological developments that have resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, substantial improvements in the functionality and performance of rigs and equipment. Our customers demand the services of newer, higher specification drilling rigs. This has resulted in a bifurcation of the drilling fleet for both the jackup and floater rig classes and is evidenced by the higher specification drilling rigs generally operating at higher overall utilization levels and day rates than the lower specification or standard drilling rigs, and a significant number of lower specification rigs being stacked. In addition, current competitors or new market entrants may adopt or develop new technologies, services or standards that could render some of our services or equipment obsolete. As a result, we may be required to expend capital to maintain and improve existing rigs and equipment, or purchase and construct newer, higher specification drilling rigs in the future, to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers. If we are not successful in doing so, we could lose market share.\nRig upgrade, repair and construction projects are subject to risks, including delays, cost overruns, and failure to secure drilling contracts.\nAs of November 2, 2016, there were 31 ultra-deepwater drillships and semisubmersibles under construction for delivery through calendar year 2020 and 106 newbuild jackup rigs under construction with expected delivery dates through calendar year 2020. As a result, shipyards and third-party equipment vendors are under significant resource constraints to meet delivery obligations. Such constraints may lead to delivery and commissioning delays and/or equipment failures and/or quality deficiencies. Furthermore, new drilling rigs may face start-up or other operational complications following completion of construction projects or other unexpected difficulties including equipment failures, design or engineering problems that could result in significant downtime at reduced or zero day rates or the cancellation or termination of drilling contracts.\nWe currently have two ultra-deepwater drillships under construction. Neither of these drillships have long-term drilling contracts in place. We may also commence the construction of additional rigs for our fleet from time to time without first obtaining drilling contracts covering any such rig. Our failure to secure drilling contracts for rigs under construction, including our remaining uncontracted newbuild drillships, prior to delivery from the shipyard could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. During fiscal year 2016, we postponed the delivery of these drillships. See Note 3 to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K.\nSince 2010, we have invested or committed to invest over $4.5 billion in the expansion of our fleet, including ultra-deepwater and jackup rigs. Depending on available opportunities, we may construct additional rigs for our fleet in the future. In addition, we incur significant upgrade, refurbishment and repair expenditures on our fleet from time to time. Some of these expenditures are unplanned. Our projects are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project resulting from numerous factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nshortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor;\n\u2022\nunscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment and failure of third-party equipment to meet quality and/or performance standards;\n\u2022\nunanticipated actual or purported change orders;\n\u2022\nunanticipated increases in the cost of equipment, labor and raw materials, particularly steel;\n\u2022\ndamage to shipyard facilities or construction in progress or delays in construction, resulting from fire, explosion, flooding, severe weather, terrorism, war or other armed hostilities;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions;\n\u2022\ndesign and engineering problems;\n\u2022\nclient acceptance delays;\n\u2022\npolitical, social and economic instability, war and civil disturbances;\n\u2022\ndelays in customs clearance of critical parts or equipment;\n\u2022\nfinancial or other difficulties or failures at shipyards and suppliers;\n\u2022\nclaims of force majeure events;\n\u2022\ndisputes with shipyards and suppliers;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages and other labor disputes; and\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations impacting overall cost.\nBoth of our rigs currently under construction are located at a single shipyard and any such events that affect the shipyard may impact both of our rigs under construction. Delays in the delivery of rigs being constructed or undergoing upgrade, refurbishment or repair may result in delay in contract commencement, resulting in a loss or delay of revenue to us and may cause our clients to seek to terminate or shorten the terms of their contract under applicable late delivery clauses, if any. In the event of termination of any of our contracts, we may not be able to secure a replacement contract on as favorable terms, if at all.\nThe estimated capital expenditures for rig upgrades, refurbishments and construction projects could materially exceed our planned capital expenditures. Moreover, our rigs undergoing upgrade, refurbishment and repair may not earn a day rate during the period they are out-of-service.\nOperating hazards increase our risk of liability; we may not be able to fully insure against all of these risks.\nOur operations are subject to various operating hazards and risks, including:\n\u2022\nwell blowouts, loss of well control and reservoir damage;\n\u2022\nfires and explosions;\n\u2022\ncatastrophic marine disaster;\n\u2022\nadverse sea and weather conditions;\n\u2022\nmechanical failure;\n\u2022\nnavigation errors;\n\u2022\ncollision;\n\u2022\noil and hazardous substance spills, containment and clean up;\n\u2022\nlost or stuck drill strings;\n\u2022\nequipment defects;\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches of our information systems or other technological failures;\n\u2022\nlabor shortages and strikes;\n\u2022\ndamage to and loss of drilling rigs and production facilities; and\n\u2022\nwar, sabotage, terrorism and piracy.\nThese risks present a threat to the safety of personnel and to our rigs, cargo, equipment under tow and other property, as well as the environment. Our operations and those of others could be suspended as a result of these hazards, whether the fault is ours or that of a third party. In certain circumstances, governmental authorities may suspend drilling operations as a result of these hazards, and therefore our clients may cancel or terminate their contracts. Third parties may have significant claims against us for damages due to personal injury, death, property damage, pollution and loss of business if such event were to occur in our operations.\nOur offshore drilling operations are also subject to marine hazards, either at offshore sites or while drilling equipment is under tow, such as vessel capsizings, sinkings, collisions or groundings. In addition, raising and lowering jackup drilling rigs, flooding semisubmersible ballast tanks and drilling into high-pressure formations are complex, hazardous activities, and we can encounter problems.\nWe have had accidents in the past due to some of the hazards described above. Because of the ongoing hazards associated with our operations:\n\u2022\nwe may experience accidents;\n\u2022\nour insurance coverage may prove inadequate to cover our losses;\n\u2022\nour insurance deductibles may increase; or\n\u2022\nour insurance premiums may increase to the point where maintaining our current level of coverage is prohibitively expensive or we may be unable to obtain insurance at all.\nWe maintain insurance coverage against casualty and liability risks and have renewed our primary insurance program through June 30, 2017. Certain risks, however, such as pollution, reservoir damage and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Although we believe our insurance is adequate, our policies and contractual indemnity rights may not adequately cover all losses or may have exclusions of coverage for certain losses. We do not have insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all risks. In addition, we may be unable to renew or maintain our existing insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or at all. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or contractual indemnity, it could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. There is no assurance that our insurance coverage will be available or affordable and, if available, whether it will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise. Additionally, there is no assurance that those parties with contractual obligations to indemnify us will necessarily be financially able or willing to indemnify us against all these risks.\nThe U.S. Gulf of Mexico experiences hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions on a relatively frequent basis. In recent years, hurricanes have caused damage to a number of rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. As a result, insurance companies have reduced the nature and amount of insurance coverage available for losses arising from named windstorm damage in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and have increased the costs of such coverage. Our current windstorm insurance policy for the Atwood Condor has a policy limit of $150 million and a per occurrence deductible of $10 million. Our limited windstorm insurance coverage exposes us to a significant level of risk if the Atwood Condor were to experience significant damage or loss related to severe weather conditions caused by hurricanes or tropical storms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.\nOur drilling contracts provide for varying levels of indemnification from our clients and in most cases may require us to indemnify our clients. Under offshore drilling contracts, liability with respect to personnel and property is customarily assigned on a \u201cknock-for-knock\u201d basis, which means that we and our clients assume liability for our respective personnel and property. However, in certain cases we may have liability for damage to our client\u2019s property and other third-party property on the rig. Our clients typically assume responsibility for and indemnify us from any loss or liability resulting from pollution or contamination, including clean-up and removal and third-party damages, arising from operations under the contract and originating below the surface of the water, including as a result of blow-outs or cratering of the well. In some drilling contracts, however, we may have liability for third-party damages resulting from such pollution or contamination caused by our gross negligence, or, in some cases, ordinary negligence, subject to negotiated caps. We generally indemnify the client for legal and financial consequences of spills of industrial waste and other liquids originating from our rigs or equipment above the surface of the water.\nThe above description of our insurance program and the indemnification provisions of our drilling contracts is only a summary and is general in nature. Our insurance program and the terms of our drilling contracts may change in the future. In addition, the indemnification provisions of our drilling contracts may be subject to differing interpretations, and enforcement of those provisions may be limited by public policy and other considerations.\nDrilling contracts with national oil companies may expose us to greater risks than we normally assume in drilling contracts with non-governmental clients.\nContracts with national oil companies are often non-negotiable and may expose us to greater commercial, political and operational risks than we assume in other contracts, such as exposure to materially greater environmental liability and other claims for damages (including consequential damages) and personal injury related to our operations, or the risk that the contract may be terminated by our client without cause on short-term notice, contractually or by governmental action, under certain conditions that may not provide us an early termination payment, collection risks and political risks. In addition, our ability to resolve disputes or enforce contractual provisions may be negatively impacted with these contracts. While we believe that the financial, commercial and risk allocation terms of these contracts and our operating safeguards mitigate these risks, we can provide no assurance that the increased risk exposure will not have an adverse impact on our future operations or that we will not increase the number of rigs contracted to national oil companies with commensurate additional contractual risks.\nOur long-term contracts are subject to the risk of cost increases, which could adversely impact our profitability.\nIn periods of rising demand for offshore rigs, a drilling contractor generally would prefer to enter into well-to-well or other short-term contracts less than one year in duration that would allow the contractor to profit from increasing day rates, while clients with reasonably definite drilling programs would typically prefer long-term contracts in order to maintain day rates at a consistent level. Conversely, in periods of decreasing demand for offshore rigs, a drilling contractor generally would prefer long-term contracts to preserve day rates and utilization, while clients generally would prefer well-to-well or other short-term contracts that would allow the client to benefit from the decreasing day rates. In the current market, we may not be able to renew long-term contracts that preserve day rates and utilization, or our clients may seek to renegotiate day rates under our existing long-term contracts.\nIn general, our costs increase as the business environment for drilling services improves and demand for oilfield equipment and skilled labor increases. While many of our contracts include cost escalation provisions that allow changes to our day rate based on stipulated cost increases or decreases, the timing and amount earned from these day rate adjustments may differ from our actual increase in costs. Additionally, if our rigs incur idle time between contracts, we typically do not remove personnel from those rigs because we utilize the crew to prepare the rig for its next contract. During times of reduced activity, reductions in costs may not be immediate as portions of the crew may be required to prepare our rigs for stacking, after which time the crew members are assigned to active rigs or dismissed. Moreover, as our rigs are mobilized from one geographic location to another, the labor and other operating and maintenance costs can vary significantly. In general, labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels and inflation. Equipment maintenance expenses fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the rig is performing and the age and condition of the equipment. Contract preparation expenses vary based on the scope and length of contract preparation required and the duration of the firm contractual period over which such expenditures are amortized.\nCovenants in our debt agreements restrict our ability to engage in certain activities.\nOur debt agreements restrict our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock or subordinated debt;\n\u2022\nmake loans and other types of investments;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nreceive dividends, loans or asset transfers from our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nsell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to, another person;\n\u2022\nacquire assets or businesses;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nenter into new lines of business.\nIn addition, our Credit Facility contains various financial covenants. On March 25, 2016, we entered into an amendment to our Credit Facility (the \"Fourth Amendment\") that, among other things, effective on March 28, 2016, (i) removed the maximum leverage ratio and maximum secured leverage ratio financial covenants, (ii) amended the minimum interest expense coverage ratio such that it is not applicable until the quarter ending September 30, 2018, and decreased the minimum ratio required to 1.15:1.00, (iii) added a minimum liquidity financial covenant of $150 million, (iv) revised the restricted payments covenant to prohibit us from paying dividends, (v) reduced the total commitments under the Credit Facility by $152 million, and (vi) permits the incurrence of up to $400 million of second lien debt, subject to the parameters set forth therein. As a result of the Fourth Amendment, borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at the Eurodollar rate plus a margin ranging from 2.50% to 3.25% and the commitment fee on the unused portion of the underlying commitment ranges from 1.00% to 1.30% per annum, in each case based on our corporate credit ratings.\nOur ability to meet these covenants or requirements may be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will satisfy such covenants and requirements in the future. If market or other economic conditions remain depressed or further deteriorate, our ability to meet these covenants and requirements may be impaired. Such restrictions may limit our ability to successfully execute our business plans, which may have adverse consequences on our operations.\nWe do not intend to pay, and the covenants contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness include restrictions on our ability to pay, dividends on our common stock.\nIn February 2016, our board of directors eliminated the payment of a quarterly dividend in order to preserve liquidity. Furthermore, in March 2016, we entered into an amendment to our Credit Facility that, among other things, revised the restricted payments covenant under our credit facility to prohibit us from paying dividends during the term of the facility. Future reinstatement of dividends would require the amendment or waiver of such provision. In addition, the declaration and amount of any future dividends would be at the discretion of our board of directors and would depend on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, prospects, industry conditions, capital requirements and other factors and restrictions our board of directors deemed relevant. There can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future.\nA change in tax laws in any country in which we operate could result in higher tax expense.\nWe conduct our worldwide operations through various subsidiaries. Tax laws and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation. Consequently, we are subject to changing tax laws, treaties and regulations in and between countries in which we operate. Our income tax expense is based on our interpretation of the tax laws in effect at the time the expense was incurred. Tax legislation is proposed from time to time which could, among other things, limit our ability to defer the taxation of non-U.S. income and would increase current tax expense. A change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or in the interpretation thereof, could result in a materially higher tax expense or a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings.\nWe file periodic tax returns that are subject to review and audit by various revenue agencies in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Taxing authorities may challenge any of our tax positions. We are currently contesting tax assessments that could have a material impact on our financial statements and we may contest future assessments where we believe the assessments are in error. Determinations by such authorities that differ materially from our recorded estimates, favorably or unfavorably, may have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nGovernment regulations and environmental risks could reduce our business opportunities and increase our costs.\nWe must comply with extensive government laws and regulations in the form of international conventions, federal, state and local laws and regulations in jurisdictions where our vessels operate and are registered. These conventions, laws and regulations govern oil spills, including oil spill prevention, and matters of environmental protection, worker health and safety, and the manning, construction and operation of vessels, and vessel and port security. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable environmental, health and safety and vessel and port security laws and regulations as currently in effect. We are not a party to any pending governmental litigation or similar proceeding, and we are not aware of any threatened governmental litigation or proceeding which, if adversely determined, would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, failure to comply with these laws and regulations or the occurrence of an incident such as an oil spill may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and even criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations and other damages, the denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations and the issuance of injunctions that may limit or prohibit our operations or afford our clients the right to terminate or seek to renegotiate their drilling contracts to our detriment. Some of these laws and regulations impose strict and, with limited exceptions, joint and several liability. In addition, compliance with environmental, health and safety and vessel and port security laws increases our costs of doing business. Further, the offshore drilling industry depends on demand for services from the oil and natural gas exploration, development and production industry, and, accordingly, we also are directly affected by the adoption of laws and regulations that, for economic, environmental or other policy reasons, curtail exploration and development drilling for oil and natural gas.\nEnvironmental, health and safety and vessel and port security laws change frequently, and we may not be able to anticipate such changes or the impact of such changes. There is no assurance that we can avoid significant costs, liabilities and penalties imposed as a result of governmental regulation in the future. Changes in laws or regulations regarding offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production activities, the cost or availability of insurance, and decisions by clients, governmental agencies or other industry participants could reduce demand for our services or increase our costs of operations, which could have a negative impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, but we cannot reasonably or reliably estimate that such changes will occur, when they will occur or if they will impact us. Such changes can occur quickly within a region, similar to the increases in regulatory requirements in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico following the Macondo well incident in April 2010. These changes may impact utilization and day rates both in the affected region and globally. We may not be able to respond quickly, or at all, to mitigate against such changes.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or foreign anti-bribery legislation could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices and impact our business. Although we have programs in place covering compliance with anti-bribery legislation, any failure to comply with the FCPA or other anti-bribery legislation could provide a client with termination rights under a contract and could subject us to civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions, disgorgement of related profits and the seizure of rigs or other assets.\nOur international operations may involve risks not generally associated with domestic operations.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from operations outside the United States. Our operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business internationally, such as:\n\u2022\nlegal and governmental regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022\npolitical, social and economic instability;\n\u2022\nterrorist acts, piracy, kidnapping, extortion, war and civil disturbances;\n\u2022\nlanguage and cultural difficulties;\n\u2022\npotential rig seizure, arrest, expropriation or nationalization of assets or confiscatory taxation;\n\u2022\nimport-export quotas or other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nrenegotiation, nullification or modification of existing contracts;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;\n\u2022\nforeign and domestic monetary policies;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages;\n\u2022\ncomplications associated with repairing and replacing equipment in remote locations;\n\u2022\nlimitations on insurance coverage, such as war risk coverage, in certain areas;\n\u2022\nwage and price controls;\n\u2022\nassaults on property or personnel, including kidnappings;\n\u2022\ntravel limitations or operational problems caused by public health issues, epidemics or security threats;\n\u2022\nimposition of currency exchange controls;\n\u2022\nsolicitation by governmental officials for improper payments or other forms of corruption;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange fluctuations and devaluations; or,\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including those due to changes in laws or interpretation of existing laws.\nOur non-U.S. operations are subject to various laws and regulations in certain countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to the import and export, equipment and operation of drilling units, currency conversions and repatriation, oil and gas exploration and development, and taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel. Governments in some foreign countries have become increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions and companies holding concessions, the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industries in their countries, including local content requirements for participating in tenders for certain drilling contracts. Many governments favor or effectively require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. In addition, government action, including initiatives by OPEC, may continue to cause oil or gas price volatility. In some areas of the world, this governmental activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work by major oil companies and may continue to do so. Operations in less developed countries can be subject to legal systems which are not as mature or predictable as those in more developed countries, which can lead to greater uncertainty in legal matters and proceedings.\nSome of our drilling contracts are partially payable in local currency. Those amounts may exceed our local currency needs, leading to the accumulation of excess local currency, which, in certain instances, may be subject to either temporary blocking or other difficulties converting to U.S. dollars. Excess amounts of local currency may be exposed to the risk of currency exchange losses.\nThe shipment of goods, services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade and other laws and regulations. Our import and export activities are governed by unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate. Moreover, many countries, including the U.S., control the import and export of certain goods, services and technology and impose related import and export recordkeeping and reporting obligations, the laws and regulations related to which are complex and constantly changing. These laws and regulations may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner materially impacting our operations. Shipments may be delayed and denied import or export for a variety of reasons, some of which are outside our control and such delays or denials could cause unscheduled operational downtime. Any failure to comply or alleged failure to comply with these applicable legal and regulatory obligations also could result in criminal and civil penalties and sanctions, such as fines, imprisonment, debarment from government contracts, seizure of rigs and loss of import and export privileges.\nIn the past, these conditions or events have not materially affected our operations. However, we cannot predict whether any such conditions or events might develop in the future. Also, we organized our subsidiary structure and our operations, in part, based on certain assumptions about various foreign and domestic tax laws, currency exchange requirements and capital and profit repatriation laws. While we believe our assumptions are correct, there can be no assurance that taxing or other authorities will reach the same conclusion. If our assumptions are incorrect, or if the relevant countries change or modify such laws or the current\ninterpretation of such laws, we may suffer adverse tax and financial consequences, including the reduction of cash flow available to meet required debt service and other obligations. Any of these factors could materially adversely affect our international operations and, consequently, our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur information technology systems are subject to cybersecurity risks and threats.\nWe depend on information technology systems to conduct our operations, including critical systems on our drilling units, and these systems are subject to risks associated with cyber incidents or attacks. Due to the nature of cyber attacks, breaches to our systems could go unnoticed for a prolonged period of time. These cybersecurity risks could disrupt our operations and result in downtime, loss of revenue or the loss of critical data as well as result in higher costs to correct and remedy the effects of such incidents. If our systems for protecting against cyber incidents or attacks prove to be insufficient and an incident were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Currently we carry limited insurance for losses related to cybersecurity attacks, and may determine not to obtain such insurance in the future.\nOur business is subject to war, sabotage, terrorism and piracy, which could have an adverse effect.\nCurrent and future military campaigns may have unforeseen effects on the energy industry in general, or us in particular, in the future. Uncertainty surrounding retaliatory military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including changes in the insurance markets, disruptions of fuel supplies and markets, particularly oil, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities, including pipelines, production facilities, refineries, electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror. War or risk of war may also have an adverse effect on the economy.\nActs of war, sabotage, terrorism, piracy and social unrest, brought about by world political events or otherwise, have caused instability in the world\u2019s financial and insurance markets in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Such acts could be directed against companies such as ours and could also adversely affect the oil, gas and power industries and restrict their future growth. Insurance premiums could increase and coverage may be unavailable in the future.\nFailure to obtain and retain key personnel could impede our operations.\nWe depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and other key management personnel. There is no assurance that these individuals will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or other personnel could adversely affect our operations.\nWe require highly skilled personnel to operate our drilling rigs and provide technical services and support for our business worldwide. Historically, competition for the labor required for drilling operations and construction projects, has intensified as the number of rigs activated, added to worldwide fleets or under construction increased, leading to shortages of qualified personnel in the industry and creating upward pressure on wages and higher turnover. We may experience increased competition for the crews necessary to operate our rigs. If increased competition for labor were to intensify in the future, we may experience increases in costs or reductions in experience levels which could impact operations. The shortages of qualified personnel or the inability to obtain and retain qualified personnel could also negatively affect the quality, safety and timeliness of our work.\nSignificant parts or equipment shortages, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality and sourcing issues or price increases could increase our operating costs, decrease our revenues and adversely impact our operations.\nOur operations rely on a significant supply of capital equipment and consumable spare parts to maintain and repair our fleet. We also rely on the supply of ancillary services, including supply boats and helicopters. Certain high specification parts and equipment we use in our operations may be available only from a small number of suppliers, manufacturers or service providers, or in some cases must be sourced through a single supplier, manufacturer or service provider. A disruption in the deliveries from such third-party suppliers, manufacturers or service providers, capacity constraints, production disruptions, price increases, quality control issues, recalls or other decreased availability of parts and equipment could adversely affect our ability to meet our commitments to clients, adversely impact our operations and revenues, delay our rig upgrade, repair or construction projects, or increase our operating costs.\nUnionization efforts and labor regulations in certain countries in which we operate could materially increase our costs or limit our flexibility.\nCertain of our employees and contractors in international markets are represented by labor unions or work under collective bargaining or similar agreements, which are subject to periodic renegotiation. Efforts may be made from time to time to unionize portions of our workforce. In addition, we may be subject to strikes or work stoppages and other labor disruptions in the future. Additional unionization efforts, new collective bargaining agreements or work stoppages could materially increase our costs, reduce our revenues or limit our operational flexibility.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we help our clients discover.\nThere is a concern that emissions of greenhouse gases (\u201cGHG\u201d) may alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that affect the global climate. Climate change, including the impact of global warming, may create physical and financial risk. Physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions. Given the maritime nature of our business, we do not believe that physical climate change is likely to have a material adverse effect on us. Financial risks relating to climate change are likely to arise from increasing legislation and regulation, as compliance with any new rules could be difficult and costly.\nU.S. federal legislation has been proposed in Congress to reduce GHG emissions, but to date efforts to pass federal legislation limiting GHG emissions have not been successful, though it is possible that such legislation may be enacted in the U.S. in the future. Foreign jurisdictions are also addressing climate changes by legislation or regulation. The adoption of legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could require us to incur increased fuel, environmental and other costs and capital expenditures to comply. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nAdverse impacts upon the oil and gas industry relating to climate change may also affect us as demand for our services depends on the level of activity in offshore oil and natural gas exploration, development and production. Although we do not expect that demand for oil and gas will lessen dramatically over the short term, concerns about climate change may reduce the demand for oil and gas in the long term. In addition, increased regulation of GHG may create greater incentives for use of alternative energy sources. Any long term material adverse effect on the oil and gas industry may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, but we cannot reasonably or reliably estimate if it will occur, when it will occur or that it will impact us.\nWe are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of our constitutive documents and Texas law.\nHolders of the shares of an acquisition target often receive a premium for their shares upon a change of control. Texas law and provisions of constitutive documents could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control and could prevent holders of our common stock from receiving such a premium. For example, Texas law prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with any shareholder for three years from the date that person became an affiliated shareholder by beneficially owning 20% or more of our outstanding common stock, in the absence of certain board of director or shareholder approvals.\nIn addition, under our By-laws, special meetings of shareholders may not be called by anyone other than our Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, our President and Chief Executive Officer, or the holders of at least 10% of the shares of our capital stock entitled to vote at such meeting.", "PERMNO": 15721, "SIC": 1381, "TIC": "ATW"}
