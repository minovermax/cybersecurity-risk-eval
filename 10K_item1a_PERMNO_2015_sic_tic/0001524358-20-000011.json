{"cik": "1524358", "company": "MARRIOTT VACATIONS WORLDWIDE Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis section describes circumstances or events that could have a negative effect on our financial results or operations or that could change, for the worse, existing trends in our businesses. The occurrence of one or more of the circumstances or events described below could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and/or on the trading prices of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that currently are not known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may adversely affect our businesses and operations.\nRisks related to our business and industry\nContraction in the global economy or low levels of economic growth could impact our financial results and growth.\nOur business and the vacation ownership industry are particularly affected by negative trends in the general economy, and the recovery period in our industry may lag behind overall economic improvement. Demand for vacation ownership industry products and services is linked to a number of factors relating to general global, national and regional economic conditions, including perceived and actual economic conditions, exchange rates, availability of credit and business and personal discretionary spending levels. Weakened consumer confidence and limited availability of consumer credit can cause demand for our vacation ownership products to decline, which may reduce our revenue and profitability. Because a significant portion of our expenses, including personnel costs, interest, property taxes and insurance, are relatively fixed, we may not be able to adjust spending quickly enough to offset revenue decreases. Adverse economic conditions may also cause purchaser defaults on our vacation ownership notes receivable to increase. In addition, adverse global and national economic and political events, as well as significant terrorist attacks, are likely to have a dampening effect on the economy in general, which could negatively affect our financial performance and our stock price.\nThe sale of vacation ownership interests in the secondary market by existing owners could cause our sales revenues and profits to decline.\nExisting owners have offered, and are expected to continue to offer, their VOIs for sale on the secondary market. The prices at which these interests are sold are typically less than the prices at which we would sell the interests. As a result, these sales can create pricing pressure on our sale of vacation ownership products, which could cause our sales revenues and profits to decline. In addition, if the secondary market for VOIs becomes more organized and liquid than it currently is, the resulting availability of VOIs (particularly where the VOIs are available for sale at lower prices than the prices at which we would sell them) could adversely affect our sales and our sales revenues. Further, unlawful or deceptive third-party VOI resale schemes involving interests in our resorts could damage our reputation and brand value and adversely impact our sales revenues.\nDevelopment of a more robust secondary market may also cause the volume of VOI inventory that we are able to repurchase to decline, which could adversely impact our development margin, as we utilize this lower cost inventory source to supplement our inventory needs and reduce our cost of vacation ownership products.\nOur ability to develop, acquire and repurchase vacation ownership inventory may be impaired if we or third parties with whom we do business, including vacation property developers, are unable to access capital when necessary.\nThe availability of funds for new investments, primarily developing, acquiring or repurchasing vacation ownership inventory, depends in part on liquidity factors and capital markets over which we can exert little, if any, control. We have historically securitized in the ABS market the majority of the U.S. dollar denominated consumer loans that we originate, completing transactions at least once each year for the past several years. Instability in the financial markets could impact the timing and volume of any securitizations we undertake, as well as the financial terms of such securitizations. Any future deterioration in the financial markets could preclude, delay or increase the cost to us of future note securitizations. Such deterioration could also impact our ability to renew our Warehouse Credit Facility, which we must do in order to access funds under that facility after December 2021, on terms favorable to us, or at all. Further, any indebtedness we incur, including indebtedness under the Revolving Corporate Credit Facility or the Warehouse Credit Facility, may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing. If we are unable to access these sources of funds on acceptable terms, our ability to acquire additional vacation ownership inventory, repurchase VOIs that our owners propose to sell to third-parties, or make other investments in our business could be impaired. In addition, a slowdown in sales of VOIs decreases the sources of new members for our exchange networks, and developers may seek to extend or adjust payment terms with us.\nInability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all, previously caused and may in the future cause insolvency of developers whose resorts are in our exchange networks. This in turn could reduce or stop the flow of new members from their resorts and also could adversely affect the operations and desirability of exchange with those resorts if the developer\u2019s insolvency impacts the management of the resorts. In some cases, a developer in bankruptcy could terminate its existing exchange relationship with us.\nOur reliance on capital efficient transactions to satisfy a portion of our future needs for Vacation Ownership segment inventory and additional on-site sales locations may impact our ability to have inventory available for sale when needed.\nWe have entered into capital efficient transactions in which third parties are responsible for delivering completed units which we expect to purchase at pre-agreed prices in the future. As we continue to execute our strategy to deploy capital efficiently, we will seek to enter into additional transactions to source inventory using similar or new transaction structures. These structures may expose us to additional risk as we will not control development activities or timing of development\ncompletion. If third parties with whom we enter into capital efficient transactions do not fulfill their obligations to us, or if they exercise their right to sell inventory to a third party other than us, the inventory we expect to acquire may not be delivered on time or at all, or may not otherwise be within agreed upon specifications. If our capital efficient transaction counterparties do not perform as expected and we do not purchase the expected inventory or obtain inventory from alternative sources on a timely basis, we may not be able to achieve sales forecasts. In addition, we anticipate opening new on-site sales locations in connection with some or all of our new resort locations. If third parties with whom we enter into transactions do not deliver these sales locations as expected, our future sales growth could be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, if developers or other third parties are not able to obtain or maintain financing necessary for their operations, we may not be able to enter into capital efficient transactions with third parties. If we are not able to enter into such transactions, we may need to increase inventory investments, which would decrease our financial flexibility.\nWe may not be able to integrate Legacy-ILG\u2019s businesses successfully and we may not realize many of the anticipated benefits of the combination.\nAchieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of ILG is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether ILG\u2019s business can be integrated with ours in an efficient and effective manner. The integration process could take longer or be more costly than anticipated and could result in the loss of valuable employees, the disruption of ongoing businesses, processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation arrangements, any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the combination. We may have difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected net income and could adversely affect our future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nOur future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations which include the external exchange business.\nThe size of our business increased significantly as a result of the ILG Acquisition. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, including ILG\u2019s external exchange business, which poses substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. We may not be successful or we may not realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the ILG Acquisition.\nInsufficient availability of exchange inventory may adversely affect our profits.\nOur exchange networks\u2019 transaction levels are influenced by the supply of inventory in the system and the demand for such available inventory. The availability of exchange inventory in the Interval International network is dependent on it being deposited into the system, directly by a member in support of a current or future exchange request, or by a developer on behalf of its owners to support their anticipated exchanges.\nA number of factors may impact the supply and demand of inventory. For example, economic conditions may negatively impact our members\u2019 desire to travel, often resulting in an increase in the number of deposits made as a means of preserving the inventory\u2019s value for exchange at a later date when the member is ready to travel, while reducing the demand for inventory which is then available for exchange. Also, destination-specific factors such as regional health and safety concerns, the occurrence or threat of natural disasters and weather may decrease our members\u2019 desire to travel or exchange to a given destination, resulting in an increased supply of, but a decreased demand for, inventory from this destination. Also, inventory may not be as available because owners are choosing to travel to their home resort/vacation club system or otherwise not depositing with the Interval International network. In these instances, the demand for exchange and Getaway inventory may be greater than the inventory available. Where the supply and demand of inventory do not keep pace, transactions may decrease or we may elect to purchase additional inventory to fulfill the demand, both of which could negatively affect our profits and margin.\nPurchaser defaults on the vacation ownership notes receivable our business generates could reduce our revenues, cash flows and profits.\nIn connection with our vacation ownership business, we provide loans to purchasers to finance their purchase of VOIs. Accordingly, we are subject to the risk that purchasers of our VOIs may default on the financing that we provide. The risk of purchaser defaults may increase due to man-made or natural disasters, which cause financial hardship for purchasers. The risk of purchaser defaults may also increase if we do not evaluate accurately the creditworthiness of the customers to whom we extend financing or due to the influence of timeshare relief firms. Purchaser defaults have caused, and may continue to cause us to foreclose on vacation ownership notes receivable and reclaim ownership of the financed interests, both for loans that we have not securitized and in our role as servicer for the vacation ownership notes receivable we have securitized through the\nABS market or the Warehouse Credit Facility. If default rates for our borrowers increase, we have been required, and may in the future be required to increase our reserve on vacation ownership notes receivable.\nIf default rates increase beyond current projections and result in higher than expected foreclosure activity, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Purchaser defaults could impact our ability to secure ABS or warehouse credit facility financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, the transactions in which we have securitized vacation ownership notes receivable contain certain portfolio performance requirements related to default and delinquency rates, which, if not met, would result in loss or disruption of cash flow until portfolio performance sufficiently improves to satisfy the requirements. In addition, we may not be able to resell foreclosed or revoked interests in a timely manner or for an attractive price which could result in an adverse impact on our results from operations. If the reclaimed interests have declined in value, we may incur impairment losses that reduce our profits. Also, if a purchaser of a VOI defaults on the related loan during the early part of the amortization period, we may not have recovered the marketing, selling and general and administrative costs associated with the sale of that VOI. If we are unable to recover any of the principal amount of the loan from a defaulting purchaser, or if the allowances for losses from such defaults are inadequate, the revenues and profits that we derive from the vacation ownership business could be reduced.\nOur operations outside of the United States make us susceptible to the risks of doing business internationally, which could lower our revenues, increase our costs, reduce our profits or disrupt our business.\nWe conduct business globally. International properties and operations expose us to a number of additional challenges and risks, including the following, any of which could reduce our revenues or profits, increase our costs, or disrupt our business:\n\u2022\ncomplex and changing laws, regulations and policies of governments that may impact our operations, including foreign ownership restrictions, import and export controls, and trade restrictions;\n\u2022\nincreases in anti-American sentiment and the identification of our brands as American brands;\n\u2022\nU.S. laws that affect the activities of U.S. companies abroad;\n\u2022\nthe presence and acceptance of varying levels of business corruption in international markets and the effect of various anticorruption and other laws;\n\u2022\ntax impacts and legal restrictions associated with the repatriation of our non-U.S. earnings;\n\u2022\nthe difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in many different countries;\n\u2022\nuncertainties as to the enforceability of contract and intellectual property rights under local laws;\n\u2022\nchanges in government policy, political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislation;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates or currency restructurings and hyperinflation or deflation in the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nforced nationalization of resort properties by local, state or national governments; and\n\u2022\nother exposure to local economic risks.\nWe also derive revenue from sales to customers from outside the United States that are transacted in United States dollars. As a result, our revenues and profits have been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the markets in which our customers reside. Any hedging transactions we enter into to mitigate currency exchange risks may not be effective or could have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nA failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations or competitive position.\nOur business model and competitive conditions in the vacation ownership industry demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems, including those used for our sales, reservation, inventory management, exchange, and property management systems, and technologies we make available to our owners and members. We must refine, update and/or replace these technologies and systems with more advanced systems or upgrades on a regular basis. If we cannot do so as quickly as our competitors or within budgeted costs and time frames, our business could suffer. Projects to refine, update and/or replace these technologies and systems may be extremely complex and require significant internal and external resources. If these resources are not available, our business and operations may be adversely affected. We also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system, and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could harm our operating results.\nFailure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data, or to protect our systems from cyber-attacks and similar incidents, could result in faulty business decisions or operational inefficiencies, damage our reputation and/or subject us to costs, fines or lawsuits.\nWe collect and retain large volumes of internal and customer data, including social security numbers, credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information of our customers in various internal information systems and information systems of our service providers. We also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees. The integrity and protection of that customer, employee and company data is critical to us. We could make faulty decisions if that data is inaccurate or incomplete. Our customers and employees also have a high expectation that we and our service providers will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment as well as the requirements imposed on us by the payment card industry surrounding information, security and privacy is also increasingly demanding, in both the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our systems may be unable to satisfy changing regulatory and payment card industry requirements and employee and customer expectations, or may require significant additional investments or time in order to do so.\nOur information systems and records, including those we maintain with our service providers, may be subject to security breaches, cyber-attack or cyber-intrusion, system failures, viruses, operator error or inadvertent releases of data. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other means of deceiving our associates, owners, customers or other users of our systems. Data breaches and intrusions have increased in recent years as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions have increased. We must continuously monitor and enhance our information security controls to prevent, detect, and/or contain unauthorized activity, access, misuse and malicious software. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. Further, even if such measures are implemented and appropriate training is conducted in support of such measures, human errors compromising the efficacy of such measures may still occur. As a result, current or future security measures may not prevent any or all breaches, and we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against, detect and remedy any potential or existing breaches and their consequences.\nLike other companies, we have experienced cyber security threats to our data and systems, our company sensitive information, and our information technology infrastructure, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and temporary disruptions. For example, in June 2018, we identified forged and fraudulently induced electronic payment disbursements we made to third parties in an aggregate amount of $10 million resulting from unauthorized third-party access to our email system. During 2018, we recovered $6 million of these funds, and during 2019, we received an additional $3 million from our insurance company as final settlement of our claim. In addition, our licensor, Marriott International, announced in November 2018 that it had experienced a data breach that included our customers\u2019 data. A significant cyber-attack or theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer, employee or company data maintained by us or by a service provider or licensor could adversely impact our reputation and could result in remedial and other expenses, fines or litigation. A breach in the security of our information systems or those of our service providers or licensors could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems, resulting in operational inefficiencies and a loss of profits.\nRoutinely, we partner with and use third-party service providers and products that host, manage, or control sensitive data. The policies, contracts and other controls we rely on to cause contractors and subcontractors to maintain reasonable security to ensure that our data is protected from unauthorized use, alteration, access or disclosure may not have the intended results. The failure by the various third-party vendors and service providers with which we do business, to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal, state or similar international laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data could damage the reputation of our businesses, discourage potential users from trying our products and services, breach certain agreements under which we have obligations with respect to network security, and/or result in fines and/or proceedings by governmental agencies, service providers and/or consumers. Any one or all of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure to keep pace with developments in social media could impair our competitive position.\nThe proliferation and global reach of social media continues to expand rapidly and could cause us to suffer reputational harm. The continuing evolution of social media presents new challenges and requires us to keep pace with new developments, technology and trends. Negative posts or comments about us, the properties we manage or our brands on any social networking or user-generated review website, including travel and vacation property websites, could affect consumer opinions of us and our products, and we cannot guarantee that we will timely or adequately redress such instances.\nInadequate or failed technologies could lead to interruptions in our operations, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur operations depend on our ability to maintain existing systems and implement new technologies, which includes allocating sufficient resources to periodically upgrade our information technology systems, and to protect our equipment and the information stored in our databases against both manmade and natural disasters, as well as power losses, computer and telecommunications failures, technological breakdowns, unauthorized intrusions, cyber-attacks, acts of war or terrorism and other events. System interruption, delays, loss of critical data and any lack of integration and redundancy in our information technology systems and infrastructure may adversely affect our ability to provide services, operate websites, process and fulfill transactions, respond to customer inquiries and generally maintain cost-efficient operations. Our backup systems only relate to certain aspects of our operations; these systems are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption. If our information technology systems are disrupted, subject to a cyber-attack or other unauthorized intrusion, become obsolete or do not adequately support our strategic, operational or compliance needs, our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition to financial consequences, disruptions to our information technology systems may materially impact our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in future periods.\nSpanish court rulings invalidating timeshare contracts have increased our exposure to litigation and such litigation may materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nA series of Spanish court rulings over the past several years invalidating timeshare contracts have increased our exposure to litigation and such litigation may materially adversely affect our business and financial condition. These rulings have invalidated certain timeshare contracts entered into after January 1999 related to certain resorts in Spain if the timeshare structure of those resorts did not meet requirements prescribed by Spanish timeshare laws enacted in 1998, even if the structure was lawful prior to 1998 and adapted to the 1998 laws pursuant to mechanisms specified in the 1998 laws. These rulings have led to an increase in lawsuits by owners seeking to invalidate timeshare contracts in Spain, including a number of such lawsuits filed by owners at certain of our resorts in Spain, some of which have been decided in favor of the owners. If additional owners at our resorts in Spain file similar lawsuits, this may: result in the invalidation of those owners\u2019 timeshare contracts entered into after January 1999; cause us to incur material litigation and other costs, including judgment or settlement payments; and materially adversely affect the results of operation of our Vacation Ownership segment, as well as our business and financial condition. The increased ability for owners of Spanish timeshares to void their contracts is negatively impacting other developers with resorts there which may lead to a significant decrease in the number of resorts located in Spain in the Interval International network and the loss of members that own VOIs at those resorts. Participants in the vacation ownership industry disagree with these rulings and are seeking to introduce legislation that will implement a more balanced approach. However, this new legislation may not be enacted. The timeshare laws, regulations and policies in Spain may continue to change or be subject to different interpretations in the future, including in ways that could negatively impact our business.\nThe industries in which our businesses operate are competitive, which may impact our ability to compete successfully.\nOur businesses will be adversely impacted if they cannot compete effectively in their respective industries, each of which is highly competitive. A number of highly competitive companies participate in the vacation ownership industry, including several that are affiliated with branded hotel companies. We believe that competition in the vacation ownership industry is driven primarily by the quality, number and location of vacation ownership resorts, trust in the brand, pricing of product offerings and the availability of program benefits, such as exchange programs and access to affiliated hotel networks. Our brands compete with the vacation ownership brands of major hotel chains in national and international venues, as well as with the vacation rental options (such as hotels, resorts and condominium rentals) offered by the lodging industry.\nInnovations that impact the industry may also lead to new products and services that could disrupt our business model and create new and stronger competitors. Under the license agreements with Marriott International and The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, if other international hotel operators offer new products and services as part of their respective hotel businesses that may directly compete with our vacation ownership products and services in the future, then Marriott International and The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company may also offer such new products and services, and use their respective trademarks in connection with such offers. If Marriott International or The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company offer new vacation ownership products and services under their trademarks, our vacation ownership products and services may compete directly with those of Marriott International or The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, and we may not be able to distinguish our vacation ownership products and services from those offered by Marriott International and The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company. Our ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain owners depends on our success in distinguishing the quality and value of our products and services from those offered by others. If we cannot compete successfully in these areas, this could limit our operating margins, diminish our market share and reduce our earnings.\nOur principal exchange network administered by Interval International included nearly 3,200 resorts located in over 80 nations participated as of December 31, 2019. Interval International\u2019s primary competitor, RCI, has a greater number of affiliated resorts than we have. Through the resources of its corporate affiliates, particularly, Wyndham Vacation Ownership, Inc., engaged in vacation ownership sales, RCI may have greater access to a significant segment of new vacation ownership purchasers and a broader platform for participating in industry consolidation. We believe that developers will continue to create, operate, and expand internal exchange and vacation club systems, which decreases their reliance on external vacation ownership exchange programs, including those we offer, and adversely impacts the supply of resort accommodations available through our external exchange networks. The effects on our business are more pronounced as the proportion of vacation club corporate members in the Interval International network increases.\nOur businesses also compete for leisure travelers with other leisure lodging operators, including both independent and branded properties as well as with alternative lodging marketplaces such as Airbnb and HomeAway, which operate websites that market available furnished, privately-owned residential properties in locations throughout the world, including homes and condominiums, which can be rented on a nightly, weekly or monthly basis. Competitive pressures may cause us to reduce our fee structure or potentially modify our business models, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Vacation Ownership business is dependent on our ability to identify and effectively market the product to prospective purchasers.\nThe identification of prospective purchasers, and the marketing of our products to them, are essential to our success. We incur significant expenses associated with marketing programs in advance of closing sales of VOIs. If our marketing efforts are not successful and we are unable to convert prospects to a sufficient number of sales, we may be unable to recover the expense of our marketing programs and grow our business. This could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nIf our license agreements with Marriott International or Hyatt are terminated, or if our right to use their trademarks at any properties that do not meet applicable brand standards is terminated, our reputation could be harmed and our ability to market and sell our products at these properties could be impaired.\nOur success depends, in part, on the maintenance of our relationships with Marriott International and Hyatt. These relationships are governed by a number of agreements, including long-term license agreements that expire between 2090 and 2096, subject to renewal. However, if we breach our obligations under one of the license agreements, the applicable licensor may be entitled to terminate the license agreement and our rights to use their brands in connection with our businesses. In addition, if any of our properties does not meet applicable brand standards, these companies can terminate our right to use the related trademarks at the subject properties.\nThe termination of our license agreements with Marriott International or its affiliates would materially harm our business and results of operations and materially impair our ability to market and sell our products and maintain our competitive position, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our inability to rely on the strength of the Marriott, Ritz-Carlton, Sheraton and/or Westin brands to attract qualified prospects in the marketplace would likely cause our revenue and profits to decline and our marketing and sales expenses to increase. In addition, we would not be able to use the brand websites as channels through which to rent available inventory, which would cause our rental revenue to decline.\nAn important component of our direct marketing activities is focused on offering points to members of the loyalty programs associated with the Marriott, Ritz-Carlton, Sheraton, Westin and Hyatt brands. The agreements that we entered into with Marriott International and Hyatt that allow us to offer these points would also terminate upon termination of the license agreements with the applicable licensor, and we would not be able to offer such points to owners and potential owners, which would impair our ability to sell our products and would reduce the flexibility and options available in connection with our products.\nOur ability to expand our business and remain competitive could be harmed if the licensors who license their trademarks to us do not consent to the use of their trademarks at new resorts we acquire or develop in the future.\nUnder the terms of our license agreements with Marriott International and Hyatt, we must obtain the consent of the applicable licensor to use the applicable licensed trademarks in connection with resorts, residences or other accommodations that we acquire or develop in the future. If these licensors do not permit us to use their trademarks in connection with our development or acquisition plans, our ability to expand our business and remain competitive may be materially adversely affected. The requirement to obtain consent to expansion plans, or the need to identify and secure alternative expansion opportunities because we cannot obtain such consent, may delay implementation of our expansion plans and cause us to incur additional expense.\nOur Vacation Ownership business depends on the quality and reputation of the brands associated with our portfolio, and any deterioration in the quality or reputation of these brands could adversely affect our market share, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe offer vacation ownership products and services under the Marriott, Sheraton, Westin, The Ritz-Carlton, and Hyatt brands. As a result, our success depends in part on the continued success of Marriott International and Hyatt and their respective brands. Consequently, if market recognition or the positive perception of Marriott International and/or Hyatt is reduced or compromised, the goodwill associated with these brands may be adversely affected, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, the positioning and offerings of any of these brands and/or the related customer loyalty programs, could change in a manner that adversely affects our business.\nIf a branded hotel property with which one of our resorts is co-located ceases to be operated by and/or affiliated with the same brand as our resort or a related brand, our business could be harmed.\nApproximately a quarter of our Vacation Ownership segment resorts are co-located with same-branded hotel properties. If a branded hotel property with which one of our resorts is co-located ceases to be operated by or affiliated with the same brand as our resort, we could lose the benefits derived from co-location of our resorts, such as the sharing of amenities, infrastructure and staff, integration of services, and other cost efficiencies. Our owners could lose access to the more varied and elaborate amenities that are generally available at the larger campus of an integrated vacation ownership and hotel resort. We expect our overhead and operating costs for such resorts would increase. We would also lose our on-site access to hotel customers, including brand customer loyalty program members, at such resorts, which is a cost-effective marketing channel for our vacation ownership products, and our sales may decline.\nOur Exchange & Third-Party Management business depends on relationships with developers, members and other vacation property owners and any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Interval International business is dependent upon vacation ownership developers for new members and upon members and participants to renew their existing memberships and otherwise engage in transactions. Developers and members also supply resort accommodations for use in exchanges and Getaways. Our vacation rental business is dependent upon vacation property and hotel owners for vacation properties to rent to vacationers. The Interval International network has established relationships with numerous developers pursuant to exclusive multi-year affiliation agreements and we believe that relationships with these entities are generally strong, but these historical relationships may not continue in the future. During each year, the affiliation agreements for several of the Interval International\u2019s new member-producing developers are scheduled to renew. The non-renewal of an affiliation agreement will adversely affect our ability to secure new members for our programs from the non-renewing resort or developer, and will result in the loss of existing Interval International members (and their vacation interests) at the end of their current membership, and related revenue to the extent that we do not secure membership renewals directly from such members. For corporate member relationships, where the developer renews Interval International membership fees for all of its active owners, this has a greater effect.\nIn addition, we may be unable to negotiate new affiliation agreements with resort developers or secure renewals with existing members in our Interval International network, and our failure to do so would result in decreases in the number of new and/or existing members, the supply of resort accommodations available through our exchange networks and related revenue. The loss or renegotiation on less favorable terms of several of our largest affiliation agreements could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to maintain affiliation agreements with resort developers is also impacted by consolidation in the vacation ownership industry. If resort developers who have affiliation agreements choose not to renew at the end of the current term or may only continue on terms less favorable to us than the existing agreements. Consolidation can also lead to larger competitors with greater resources that compete with our vacation ownership business for customers, projects and talent.\nSimilarly, the failure of our third party management businesses to maintain existing or negotiate new management agreements with hotel and vacation property owners or owners associations, as a result of the sale of property to third parties, contract dispute or otherwise, or the failure of vacationers to book vacation rentals through these businesses would result in a decrease in related revenue, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are not able to maintain relationships with third parties that support our marketing activities or our travel benefits, our business could be harmed.\nMany of our marketing activities require us to maintain relationships with third parties. For example, we market to our licensors\u2019 existing customer loyalty program members and travelers who are staying in locations where we have resorts. We also market to guests in Marriott International hotels that are located near one of our sales locations and have marketing\npartnerships with North American Marriott International reservation centers. In addition, we operate other local marketing venues in various high-traffic areas. If we are not able to maintain these marketing arrangements with these third parties on terms that are favorable to us or at all, our sales may decline, which could adversely affect our financial conditions and result of operations.\nIn addition, we depend on third parties to make certain benefits available to members of the Interval International network and we may not be able to provide these benefits to members if these third-parties won't make these benefits available. The loss of such benefits could result in a decrease in the number of Interval International members, which could materially adversely effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected by factors that disrupt or deter travel.\nThe success of our business and our profitability depend, in substantial part, upon the health of the worldwide vacation ownership, vacation rental and travel industries, and may be adversely affected by a number of factors that can disrupt or deter travel. A substantial amount of our sales activity occurs at our resorts, and sales volume is impacted by the number of prospective owners who visit our resorts. In the past, fear of exposure to contagious and other diseases, such as the Ebola virus, H1N1 Flu, Avian Flu, the Zika virus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or natural or man-made disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, floods, fires, volcanic eruptions, sinkholes, radiation releases, gas leaks and oil spills, has deterred travelers from scheduling sales tours at our resorts or caused them to cancel travel plans. This may occur again in the future, including, for example, due to fear of exposure to coronavirus. Damage to infrastructure, whether caused by natural or man-made disasters or other causes, that impedes travel also has caused, and may in the future cause travelers to delay or cancel plans to tour or visit our resorts. Actual or threatened war, civil unrest and terrorist activity, as well as heightened travel security measures instituted in response to the same, could also interrupt or deter travel plans. In addition, demand for vacation options such as our vacation ownership products may decrease if the cost of travel, including the cost of transportation and fuel, increases, airlift to vacation destinations decreases, or if general economic conditions decline. Changes in the desirability of the destinations where our branded, managed or exchange resorts are located and changes in vacation and travel patterns may adversely affect our cash flows, revenue and profits. For example, hurricanes in 2017 caused the Westin St. John Resort Villas; the Hyatt Residence Club Dorado, Hacienda del Mar and a number of other Interval International network resorts on affected islands to close for a prolonged period.\nThird-party reservation channels may negatively affect our rental revenues.\nSome of our rental customers book their stays at our resorts through third-party internet travel intermediaries, such as expedia.com, orbitz.com and booking.com, as well as lesser-known and newly emerging online travel service providers. If the percentage of bookings through these intermediaries increases, they may be able to obtain higher commissions, reduced room rates or other significant contract concessions from us. Moreover, some of these internet travel intermediaries are attempting to commoditize lodging by increasing the importance of price and general indicators of quality (such as \u201cthree-star property\u201d) at the expense of brand identification. These intermediaries also generally employ aggressive marketing strategies, including expending significant resources for online and television advertising campaigns to drive consumers to their websites. Additionally, consumers can book stays at our resorts through other distribution channels, including travel agents, travel membership associations and meeting procurement firms. Over time, consumers may develop loyalties to these third-party reservation systems rather than to our booking channels. Our business and profitability could be adversely affected if customer loyalties change significantly, diverting bookings away from our resorts.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation, and any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is heavily regulated. We are subject to a wide variety of complex international, national, federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies in jurisdictions around the world, including those specific to the vacation ownership industry, as well as those applicable to businesses generally. For example, the vacation ownership industry is subject to extensive regulations in various jurisdictions in the United States and elsewhere, which generally require vacation ownership resort developers to follow certain procedures in connection with the development, sale and marketing of vacation interests, including the filing of offering statements with relevant governmental authorities for approval and the delivery to prospective purchasers of certain information relating to the terms of the purchase and use, including rescission rights. The preparation of VOI registrations requires time and cost, and in many jurisdictions the exact date of registration approval cannot be accurately predicted. Separately, some laws, regulations and policies impact multiple areas of our business, such as securities, anti-discrimination, anti-fraud, data protection and security and anti-corruption and bribery laws and regulations or government economic sanctions, including applicable regulations of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Other laws, regulations and policies primarily affect our real estate development activities; marketing and sales activities; lending activities; or resort management activities. Additionally, our businesses are subject to laws and regulations associated with hotel and resort management,\nincluding relating to the preparation and sale of food and beverages, liquor service and health, safety and accessibility of managed premises.\nWe may not be successful in maintaining compliance with all laws, regulations and policies to which we are currently subject, and the cost of compliance with such laws, regulations and policies could be significant. While we believe that our operations and practices have been structured in a manner to materially comply with applicable laws, regulations and policies, the relevant regulatory authorities may take a contrary position. The laws, regulations and policies to which we are subject may change or be subject to different interpretation in the future, including in ways that could decrease demand for the services offered by our businesses, increase costs, subject us to additional liabilities and negatively impact our business, including by decreasing demand for the services offered by our businesses, increasing costs and/or subjecting us to additional liabilities. Failure to comply with current or future applicable laws, regulations and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, if we do not comply with applicable laws, governmental authorities in the jurisdictions where the violations occurred may revoke or refuse to renew licenses or registrations we must have in order to operate our business. Data protection laws, such as Europe\u2019s 2016 General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective on May 25, 2018, and California\u2019s Consumer Protection Act, which became effective on January 2, 2020, impose additional data protection requirements and penalties for non-compliance including administrative fines. Failure to comply with applicable laws could also render sales contracts for our products void or voidable, subject us to fines or other sanctions and increase our exposure to litigation, including claims against us by individuals alleging our failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies to which we are subject. Adverse action by governmental authorities alleging our failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies, or litigation by individuals alleging such failures, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and reputation.\nNegative public perception regarding our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nNegative public perception regarding our industry resulting from, among other things, consumer complaints regarding sales and marketing practices, consumer financing arrangements, and restrictions on exit, could result in increased regulatory scrutiny, which could result in more onerous laws, regulations, guidelines and enforcement interpretations in jurisdictions in which we operate. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation. For example, the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (\u201cASIC\u201d), which regulates timeshare offerings as financial products, enacted regulations effective January 1, 2020 that place restrictions on sales commission-based compensation structures. ASIC has announced additional regulations on the timeshare industry to be effective later in 2020.\nChanges in tax regulations or their interpretation could reduce our profits or increase our costs.\nJurisdictions in which we do business may at any time review tax and other revenue raising laws, regulations and policies, and any resulting changes could impose new restrictions, costs or prohibitions on our current practices and reduce our profits. In particular, governments may revise tax laws, regulations or official interpretations in ways that could have a significant impact on us, including modifications that could reduce the profits that we can effectively realize from our non-U.S. operations, or that could require costly changes to those operations, or the way that we structure them. For example, the effective tax rates of most U.S. corporations reflect the fact that income earned and reinvested outside the United States is generally taxed at local rates, which are often much lower than U.S. tax rates. In addition, interpretation of tax regulations requires us to exercise our judgment and taxing authorities or our independent registered public accounting firm may reach conclusions about the application of such regulations that differ from our conclusions. If changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations were to significantly increase the tax rates on non-U.S. income, our effective tax rate could increase, our profits could be reduced, and if such increases were a result of our status as a U.S. corporation, we could be placed at a disadvantage to our non-U.S. competitors if those competitors remain subject to lower local tax rates.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law H.R. 1, originally known as the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act,\u201d which significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). The new legislation, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, and shifts from a \u201cworldwide\u201d system of taxation in which U.S. companies are taxed on their global income to a territorial system in which U.S. companies are only taxed on income earned in the United States. During 2018, the Department of the Treasury issued certain guidance in the form of notices and proposed regulations with respect to several provisions of the new legislation. We expect that additional regulations or other guidance may be issued with respect to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. We continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business. The impact of certain provisions of this tax reform on our financial condition and results of operations could be adverse and such impact could be material. In addition, foreign governments and U.S. state and local jurisdictions may enact tax laws in response to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nIn October 2015, the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) released a final package of suggested measures to be implemented by member nations in response to a 2013 action plan calling for a coordinated multi-jurisdictional approach to \u201cbase erosion and profit shifting\u201d by multinational companies. Multiple member jurisdictions, including countries in which we operate, have begun implementing recommended changes such as country by country reporting. These standards require multinationals to disclose certain financial and economic indicators across geographies and are expected to result in increased global tax audit activity. Additional legislative changes are anticipated in upcoming years. Certain countries have adopted unilateral changes increasing the risk of double taxation. Any changes to U.S. or international tax laws or interpretation of current or existing law could impact the tax treatment of our earnings and adversely affect our profitability.\nWe are also subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional taxes against us. Developments in an audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. The final outcome of tax audits, investigations, and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals.\nChanges in privacy laws could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively.\nWe rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including telemarketing, email marketing and postal mailings. Adoption of new laws in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, domestically or internationally, regulating marketing and solicitation or data protection, or changes to existing laws, such as the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the CAN-SPAM Act and the GDPR, could adversely affect the continuing effectiveness of telemarketing, email and postal mailing techniques and could force us to make further changes in our marketing strategy. If this occurs, we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies, which could impact the amount and timing of our sales of VOIs and other products. We also obtain access to potential customers from travel service providers or other companies with whom we have relationships and market to some individuals on these lists directly or by including our marketing message in the other companies\u2019 marketing materials. If access to these lists was prohibited or otherwise restricted, our ability to develop new customers and introduce our products to them could be impaired.\nOur points-based product forms expose us to an increased risk of temporary inventory depletion.\nSelling VOIs in a system of resorts under a points-based business model increases the risk of temporary inventory depletion. Currently, our VOI sales are made primarily through a limited number of trust entities that issue VOIs. This structure can lead to a temporary depletion of inventory available for sale caused by: (1) delayed delivery of inventory under construction by us or third parties; (2) delayed receipt of required governmental registrations of inventory for sale; and (3) significant unanticipated increases in sales pace. If the inventory available for sale for a particular trust were to be depleted before new inventory is added and available for sale, we would be required to temporarily suspend sales until inventory is replenished. Our efforts to avoid the risk of temporary inventory depletion by maintaining a surplus supply of completed inventory based on our forecasted sales pace, and by employing other mitigation strategies such as accelerating completion of resorts under construction, acquiring VOIs on the secondary market, or reducing sales pace by adjusting prices or sales incentives, may not be successful. A decline in VOI inventory could decrease our financing revenues generated from purchasers of VOIs and fee revenues generated by providing club, management, exchange, sales and marketing services. In addition, any temporary suspension of sales due to lack of inventory could reduce our cash flow and have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nOur development activities expose us to project cost and completion risks.\nOur ongoing development of new vacation ownership properties and new phases of existing vacation ownership properties presents a number of risks. Our profits may be adversely affected if construction costs escalate faster than the pace at which we can increase the price of VOIs. Construction delays, zoning and other local approvals, cost overruns, lender financial defaults, or natural or manmade disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, floods, fires, volcanic eruptions, radiation releases and oil spills, may increase overall project costs or result in project cancellations. In addition, any liability or alleged liability associated with latent defects in projects we have constructed or that we construct in the future may adversely affect our business, financial condition and reputation.\nThe maintenance and refurbishment of vacation ownership properties, and the continued financial viability of property owners\u2019 associations, depends on maintenance fees paid by the owners of VOIs.\nThe maintenance fees that are levied on owners of our VOIs by property owners\u2019 association boards are used to maintain and refurbish the vacation ownership properties. Property owners\u2019 association boards may not levy sufficient maintenance fees, or owners of VOIs may fail to pay their maintenance fees for reasons such as financial hardship or because\nof damage to their VOIs from natural disasters such as hurricanes. Many of the third-party properties that we manage do not receive subsidies or resale services for foreclosed inventory from the developer. Once a property owners\u2019 association begins to experience a high default rate, if it is unable to foreclose and resell units to paying owners, the situation worsens as the maintenance fees assessed to remaining owners continually increase to cover expenses. In these circumstances, not only could our management fee revenue be adversely affected, but the vacation ownership properties could fall into disrepair. If the property owners\u2019 associations that we manage are unable to levy and collect sufficient maintenance fees to cover the costs to operate and maintain the resort properties, such properties may be forced to close or file for bankruptcy, which may result in termination of our management agreements.\nFor branded resorts, the maintenance fees are used to keep the properties in compliance with applicable brand standards. If a resort fails to comply with applicable brand standards, the applicable licensor could terminate our rights under the applicable license agreement to use its trademarks at the non-compliant resort, which would result in the loss of management fees, decreased customer satisfaction and impairment of our ability to market and sell our products at the non-compliant locations.\nIf maintenance fees at our resorts are required to be increased, our products could become less attractive and our business could be harmed.\nThe maintenance fees that are levied on owners of our VOIs by property owners\u2019 association boards are subject to increase as the costs to maintain and refurbish the vacation ownership properties and to keep the properties in compliance with brand standards increase. A similar situation may arise with respect to fees imposed on owners of VOIs with respect to new properties added to our portfolio. Increased maintenance fees could make our products less desirable, which could have a negative impact on sales of our products and could also cause an increase in defaults with respect to our vacation ownership notes receivable portfolio.\nDisagreements with the owners of VOIs and property owners\u2019 associations may result in litigation and the loss of management contracts.\nThe nature of our relationships with our owners and our responsibilities in managing our vacation ownership properties will from time to time give rise to disagreements with the owners of VOIs and property owners\u2019 associations. Owners of our VOIs have also disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with changes we make to our products or programs. We seek to expeditiously resolve any disagreements in order to develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential owners and property owners\u2019 associations, but cannot always do so. Failure to resolve such disagreements has resulted in litigation, and could do so again in the future. If any such litigation results in a significant adverse judgment, settlement or court order, we could suffer significant losses, our profits could be reduced, our reputation could be harmed and our future ability to operate our business could be constrained. Disagreements with property owners\u2019 associations have in the past and could in the future result in the loss of management contracts.\nThe expiration, termination or renegotiation of our management contracts could adversely affect our cash flows, revenues and profits.\nWe enter into a management agreement with the property owners\u2019 association or other governing body at each of the resorts we manage and, when a trust holds interests in resorts, with the trust\u2019s governing body. Any of these management contracts may expire at the end of its then-current term (following notice by a party of non-renewal) or be terminated, or the contract terms may be renegotiated in a manner adverse to us. Upon non-renewal or termination of our management agreement for a particular resort, we lose the management fee revenue associated with the resort. If a management agreement is terminated or not renewed on favorable terms, our cash flows, revenues and profits could be adversely affected.\nConcentration of some of our resorts, sales centers and exchange destinations in particular geographic areas exposes our business to the effects of regional events and occurrences in these areas.\nSome of our Vacation Ownership resorts and sales centers are concentrated in particular geographic areas, such as Florida, South Carolina, and Hawaii. Therefore, our business is susceptible to the effects of natural or manmade disasters in these areas, including earthquakes, windstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, floods, drought, fires, oil spills and nuclear incidents. We have been required to close properties in these markets in the past in order to repair and renovate damage caused by disasters. Depending on the severity of disasters in the future, the resulting damage could require closure of all or substantially all of our properties in one or more of these markets for a period of time necessary to complete repairs and renovations. We cannot guarantee that the amount of insurance maintained for these properties would cover all damages caused by any such an event, including the loss of sales of VOIs at sales centers that are not fully operational.\nOur business is also susceptible to the effects of adverse economic developments in these areas, such as regional economic downturns, significant increases in the number of our competitors\u2019 products in these markets and potentially higher labor, real estate, tax or other costs in the geographic markets in which we are concentrated. As a result of this geographic concentration of properties, we face a greater risk of a negative effect on our revenues in the event these areas are affected by extreme weather, manmade disasters or adverse economic and competitive conditions.\nOur ongoing ability to successfully process exchange vacations for members, as well as our ability to find purchasers and vacationers for accommodations marketed or managed by us, is largely dependent on the continued desirability of the key vacation destinations in which these properties are concentrated. In addition, the same events that affect demand to one or more of these areas could significantly reduce the number of accommodations available for exchanges, Getaways or rental to vacationers, as well as the need for vacation rental and property management services generally. Any significant shift in travel demand for one or more of these key destinations or any adverse impact on transportation to them, including the factors described above, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face possible risks associated with the physical effects of climate change.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the physical effects of climate change, which could include more frequent or severe storms, droughts, hurricanes and flooding, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our resorts, operations, and business. To the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns, our affiliated properties could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels causing damage to our resorts. Over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for our products or our inability to operate the affected resorts at all. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable, as well as increasing the cost of maintenance, renovations, energy, water, and snow removal at our properties. We cannot predict with certainty whether or how climate change will impact our resorts and at what rate, and therefore there can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on us.\nDamage to, or other potential losses involving, properties that we own or manage may not be covered by insurance.\nMarket forces beyond our control may limit the scope of the insurance coverage we can obtain or our ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates. Certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, or terrorist acts, may be uninsurable or the price of coverage for such losses may be too expensive to justify obtaining insurance. As a result, the cost of our insurance may increase and our coverage levels may decrease. In addition, in the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage we carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of our lost investment or that of owners of VOIs or in some cases may not provide a recovery for any part of a loss due to deductible limits, policy limits, coverage limits or other factors. As a result, we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, and we could remain obligated under guarantees or other financial obligations related to the property. In addition, we could lose the management contract for the property and, to the extent such property operates under a licensed brand, the property may lose operating rights under the associated brand.\nOur pursuit of new business opportunities to grow our business may not be successful.\nOne of our strategic initiatives is to selectively pursue new business opportunities, such as the continued enhancement of our exchange programs, new management affiliations and acquisitions of existing vacation ownership and related businesses. In addition, in order to support our strategic objectives, we have introduced new products and services and we expect to continue to do so in the future. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in connection with opportunities in locations where the markets for vacation ownership products are not fully developed. We may invest significant time and resources in developing and marketing new businesses, products or services. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new businesses, products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of new businesses and the market acceptance of new products and services. Furthermore, any new business could strain our system of internal controls and diminish its effectiveness. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new businesses or new products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, our results of operations from new products and services that we may wish to introduce could have different revenue recognition under GAAP than our strategic objectives.\nWe are subject to certain requirements under applicable environmental laws and regulations and may be subject to potential liabilities.\nThe resorts that we manage and the assets at vacation ownership resorts that are owned by us are all subject to certain requirements and potential liabilities under foreign, national, state, and local laws and regulations that govern the discharge of\nmaterials into the environment or otherwise relate to protection of the environment or health and safety. The costs of complying with these requirements are generally covered by the property owners\u2019 associations that operate the affected resort property and are our responsibility for assets we own. To the extent that we hold interests in a particular resort, we would be responsible for their share of losses sustained by such resort as a result of a violation of any such environmental laws and regulations.\nThe growth of our business and the execution of our business strategies depend on the services of our senior management and our associates.\nWe believe that our future growth depends, in part, on the continued services of our senior management team, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, Stephen P. Weisz, and on our ability to successfully implement succession plans for members of our senior management team. The loss of any members of our senior management team, or the failure to identify successors for such positions, could adversely affect our strategic and customer relationships and impede our ability to execute our business strategies.\nIn addition, insufficient numbers of talented associates could constrain our ability to maintain and expand our business. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel. If we cannot recruit, train, develop or retain sufficient numbers of talented associates, we could experience increased associate turnover, decreased guest satisfaction, low morale, inefficiency or internal control failures. We may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave our company, or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms.\nGoodwill, acquired mortgages receivable and other intangible and long-lived assets associated with businesses we acquire and/or VOI inventory may become impaired which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe performance of the businesses that we have acquired or will acquire may not meet the financial projections anticipated at acquisition or may be impacted by one or more unfavorable events or circumstances. This could negatively affect the value of goodwill, acquired mortgages receivable and other intangible assets, as well as long-lived assets, and may require us to test the applicable reporting unit and/or asset for impairment. If following the test, we determine that we should record an impairment charge, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Additionally, we carry our acquired VOI inventory at estimated fair value, less costs to sell. If the estimates or assumptions used in our evaluation of impairment or fair value change, we may be required to record impairment losses on certain of those assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur use of different estimates and assumptions in the application of our accounting policies could result in material changes to our reported financial condition and results of operations, and changes in accounting standards or their interpretation could significantly impact our reported results of operations.\nOur accounting policies are critical to the manner in which we present our results of operations and financial condition. Many of these policies, including policies relating to the recognition of revenue and determination of cost of sales, are highly complex and involve many assumptions, estimates and judgments. We are required to review these assumptions, estimates and judgments regularly and revise them when necessary. Our actual results of operations vary from period to period based on revisions to these estimates. In addition, the regulatory bodies that establish accounting and reporting standards, including the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board, periodically revise or issue new financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Changes to these standards or their interpretation could significantly impact our reported results in future periods. See Footnote 2 \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our Financial Statements for more information regarding changes in accounting standards that we recently adopted or expect to adopt in the future.\nWe are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility and reputation.\nMany factors influence our reputation and the value of our brands, including the perception held by our owners and prospective owners, business partners, other key stakeholders, and the communities in which we do business. Our business faces increasing scrutiny related to environmental, social, and governance activities and risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our brands if we or our licensors fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as diversity and inclusion, environmental stewardship and sustainability, supply chain management, workplace conduct, human rights, philanthropy and support for local communities. Any harm to our or our licensors\u2019 reputation could impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers and partners to do business with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks related to our indebtedness and ownership of our common stock\nOur indebtedness may limit our ability to invest in the ongoing needs of our business. If we are unable to comply with the covenants in our Corporate Credit Facility and our indentures, our liquidity and results of operations could be harmed.\nIn connection with the completion of the ILG Acquisition, we significantly increased our level of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $2,267 million of total corporate indebtedness outstanding, including (i) $923 million of gross secured indebtedness under the Corporate Credit Facility, (ii) $750 million of 6.500% Senior Notes due 2026 (the \u201c2026 Notes\u201d), (iii) $350 million 4.750% Senior Notes due 2028 (the \u201c2028 Notes\u201d), and (iv) $230 million of 1.50% Convertible Notes due 2022 (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d). An additional $567 million was available for borrowing under the Revolving Corporate Credit Facility (reflecting $3 million of outstanding letters of credit) as of December 31, 2019.\nThe credit agreement that governs the Corporate Credit Facility and the indentures that govern the various senior notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, which among other things limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur debt, pay dividends and make other restricted payments, make loans and investments, incur liens, sell assets, enter into affiliate transactions, enter into agreements restricting certain subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of their assets. All of these covenants and restrictions limit how we conduct our business. In addition, we are required to maintain a specified leverage ratio under the terms of the Corporate Credit Facility.\nFailure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as others contained in our debt instruments from time to time could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in an acceleration of our obligations under the Corporate Credit Facility or the indentures. If our obligation to repay debt under the Corporate Credit Facility or the indentures were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash to repay this debt, which would immediately and materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur level of indebtedness could restrict our future operations and impact our ability to meet our payment obligations.\nOur ability to make scheduled cash payments on and to refinance our indebtedness as well as to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate significant operating cash flow in the future, which, to a significant extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow from operating activities to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nOur increased level of debt, together with the covenants included in the agreements governing such indebtedness, among other things:\n\u2022\nrequires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to servicing and repayment of debt;\n\u2022\nreduces funds available for strategic initiatives and opportunities, dividends, share repurchases, working capital and other general corporate needs;\n\u2022\nlimits our ability to incur certain kinds or amounts of additional indebtedness, which could restrict our flexibility to react to changes in our businesses, industries and economic conditions and increase borrowing costs;\n\u2022\ncreates competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels; and\n\u2022\nincreases our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIn addition, our credit ratings will impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital. Downgrades in our ratings could adversely affect our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, operating results and share and debt prices, as well as our obligations with respect to our capital efficient inventory acquisitions.\nWe may incur substantially more debt. This could exacerbate further the risks associated with our leverage.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including secured indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $4,158 million of total gross indebtedness outstanding. In the future, we could increase the amount available for borrowing under the Corporate Credit Facility by up to an amount equal to (i) the greater of $750 million and 100% of our Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Corporate Credit Facility) plus (ii) voluntary prepayments of loans and voluntary permanent commitment reductions under the Corporate Credit Facility and certain other reductions of debt plus (iii) additional amounts as long as the incurrence of such additional amounts would not exceed certain leverage ratios, in each case subject to securing additional commitments and certain other conditions.\nThe indentures that govern our various senior notes and our credit agreement for the Corporate Credit Facility permit us to incur significant additional indebtedness. In addition, the indentures governing the senior notes allow us to issue additional notes under certain circumstances, which will also be guaranteed by the guarantors. Furthermore, such agreements and instruments will not prohibit us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness as defined therein. To the extent that we and our subsidiaries incur additional indebtedness or such other obligations, the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness described above, including our potential inability to service our debt, will increase. In addition, any indebtedness we incur, including indebtedness under the Revolving Corporate Credit Facility or the Warehouse Credit Facility, may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing. If we are unable to access these sources of funds on acceptable terms, our ability to acquire additional vacation ownership inventory, repurchase VOIs, or make other investments in our business could be impaired.\nIf the default rates or other credit metrics underlying our vacation ownership notes receivable deteriorate, our vacation ownership notes receivable securitization program and VOI financing program could be adversely affected.\nOur vacation ownership notes receivable portfolio performance and securitization program could be adversely affected if a particular vacation ownership notes receivable pool fails to meet certain ratios, which could occur if the default rates or other credit metrics of the underlying vacation ownership notes receivable deteriorate. Default rates may deteriorate due to many different reasons, including those beyond our control, such as financial hardship of purchasers. In addition, if we offer loans to our customers with terms longer than those generally offered in the industry, our ability to securitize those loans may be adversely impacted. Our ability to sell securities backed by our vacation ownership notes receivable depends on the continued ability and willingness of capital market participants to invest in such securities. Volatility in the credit markets may impact the timing and volume of the vacation ownership notes receivable that we are able to securitize. ABS issued in our securitization programs could be downgraded by credit agencies in the future. If a downgrade occurs, our ability to complete other securitization transactions on acceptable terms or at all could be jeopardized, and we could be forced to rely on other potentially more expensive and less attractive funding sources, to the extent available. Similarly, if other operators of vacation ownership products experience significant financial difficulties, or if the vacation ownership industry, as a whole, contracts, we could experience difficulty in securing funding on acceptable terms. The occurrence of any of the foregoing would decrease our profitability and liquidity, which might require us to adjust our business operations, including by reducing or suspending our provision of financing to purchasers of VOIs. Sales of VOIs may decline if we reduce or suspend the provision of financing to purchasers, which may adversely affect our cash flows, revenues and profits.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nAlthough holders of the Convertible Notes are generally not permitted to convert the Convertible Notes until June 15, 2022, in the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered due to the trading price of the Convertible Notes or our common stock, holders of the Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. See Footnote 14 \u201cDebt,\u201d to our Financial Statements for additional information. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, we may elect to settle all or a portion of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Convertible Notes, may have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (\u201cASC 470-20\u201d), an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of certain convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Convertible Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of shareholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component has been treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Convertible Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Convertible Notes to their face amount over the term of the Convertible Notes. We will report lower net income (or greater net loss) in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the Convertible Notes.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash may be accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method if we have the ability and intent to settle in cash, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Convertible Notes exceeds their\nprincipal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. In order to continue to account for the Convertible Notes under the treasury stock method, we must be able to continue to demonstrate the ability or intent to settle the Convertible Notes in cash, and the accounting standards in the future must continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nThe Convertible Note Hedges and Warrants may affect the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the Convertible Notes, we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedges (the \u201cConvertible Note Hedges\u201d) with affiliates of two of the initial purchasers of the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Note Hedges cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Convertible Notes, the same number of shares of common stock that initially underlay the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Note Hedges are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to our common stock and/or offset cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount, in each case, upon any conversion of Convertible Notes. Concurrently with our entry into the Convertible Note Hedges, we entered into warrant transactions (the \u201cWarrants\u201d) with the hedge counterparties relating to the same number of shares of common stock. The Warrants could separately have a dilutive effect on our shares of common stock to the extent that the market price per share exceeds the applicable strike price of the Warrants on one or more of the applicable expiration dates.\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedges of the Convertible Note Hedges and the Warrants, the hedge counterparties and/or their respective affiliates advised us that they expected to purchase shares of our common stock in secondary market transactions and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Convertible Notes. The hedge counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock in the secondary market. The effect, if any, of these activities on the market price of our common stock or the Convertible Notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could cause or prevent an increase or a decline in the market price of our common stock or the Convertible Notes.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the Convertible Note Hedges.\nThe counterparties to the Convertible Note Hedges are financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that one or more of the hedge counterparties may default under the Convertible Note Hedges. Our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties is not secured by any collateral. If any of the hedge counterparties become subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with such counterparties. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by a hedge counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the hedge counterparties.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices or the method by which LIBOR is determined.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately $939 million of our gross aggregate consolidated indebtedness was indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). In addition, as of December 31, 2019, we were party to $550 million of derivative instruments indexed to LIBOR. Central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have commissioned working groups of market participants and official sector representatives with the goal of finding suitable replacements for LIBOR based on observable market transactions. It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next few years. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it has commitments from panel banks to continue to contribute to LIBOR through the end of 2021, but that it will not use its powers to compel contributions beyond such date. Accordingly, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the publication of such rates beyond 2021. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York and various other authorities have commenced the publication of reforms and actions relating to alternatives to U.S. dollar LIBOR. Although the full impact of such reforms and actions, together with any transition away from LIBOR, including the potential or actual discontinuance of LIBOR publication, remains unclear, these changes may have a material adverse impact on the availability of financing, including LIBOR-based loans, and on our financing costs.\nOur share repurchase program may not enhance long-term shareholder value and could increase the volatility of the market price of our common stock and diminish our cash reserves.\nThe share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount, or to acquire any specific number, of shares of our common stock. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market conditions, business conditions, statutory and contractual restrictions, the trading price of our common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities available to us. The repurchase program may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. In addition, repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a share repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Additionally, our share repurchase program could diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth, pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions, and discharge liabilities. Our share repurchases may not enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the prices at which we repurchased shares of stock and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness.\nOur ability to pay dividends on our stock is limited.\nWe intend to pay a regular quarterly dividend to our shareholders. However, we may not declare or pay such dividends in the future at any particular rate or at all. All decisions regarding our payment of dividends will be made by our Board of Directors from time to time and will be subject to an evaluation of our financial condition, results of operations and capital requirements, as well as applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice, contractual restraints and other business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant. In addition, our Corporate Credit Facility and the indentures governing the 2026 Notes and the 2028 Notes contain restrictions on our ability and/ or the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, and the terms of agreements governing debt that we may incur in the future may also limit or prohibit dividend payments. The payment of certain cash dividends may also result in an adjustment to the conversion rate of the Convertible Notes in a manner adverse to us. We may not have sufficient surplus under Delaware law to be able to pay any dividends, which may result from extraordinary cash expenses, actual expenses exceeding contemplated costs, funding of capital expenditures or increases in reserves.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law and in certain agreements to which we are party could delay or prevent a change in control.\nProvisions of our Charter and Bylaws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. For example, our Charter and Bylaws provide for a classified board, require advance notice for shareholder proposals and nominations, place limitations on convening shareholder meetings and authorize our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock. These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price. Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 15 percent or more of our outstanding common stock and us.\nIn addition, provisions in our agreements with Marriott International may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. Further, our license agreements with Marriott International and Hyatt include terms that may delay or prevent a change in control.\nFurther, a change in control could result in an acceleration of our obligations under the Corporate Credit Facility or the indentures that govern our senior notes. The threat of our debt being accelerated in connection with a change in control could make it more difficult for us to attract potential buyers or to consummate a change in control transaction that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders.\nRisks related to the Vistana Spin-Off\nThe ILG Acquisition could result in material liability if it causes the Vistana Spin-Off to be taxable.\nIn order to preserve the tax-free treatment of the spin-off of Vistana in 2016 to Starwood and its shareholders in connection with its acquisition by ILG (the \u201cVistana Spin-Off\u201d), the Tax Matters Agreement entered into in connection with the Vistana Spin-Off (the \u201cTax Matters Agreement\u201d) generally restricts ILG and Vistana from taking or failing to take any action that would cause the Vistana Spin-Off to become taxable. Failure to adhere to these restrictions, including in certain circumstances that may be outside of our control, could result in tax being imposed on Starwood or on Starwood shareholders for which we could bear responsibility and for which we could be obligated to indemnify Starwood. In addition, even if we are not responsible for tax liabilities of Starwood under the Tax Matters Agreement, Vistana nonetheless could be liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities if Starwood were to fail to pay such taxes. In particular, under the Tax Matters Agreement, for the two-year period following the Vistana Spin-Off, Vistana and ILG were prohibited from:\n\u2022\nentering into any transaction or series of transactions (or any agreement, understanding or arrangement to enter into a transaction or series of transactions) as a result of which one or more persons would (directly or indirectly)\nacquire, or have the right to acquire a number of shares of Vistana or ILG stock that would, when combined with any other direct or indirect changes in ownership of Vistana or ILG stock pertinent for purposes of Section 355(e) of the Code (including the Vistana acquisition), comprise 50% or more (by vote or value) of the stock of Vistana or ILG;\n\u2022\nselling, transferring or otherwise disposing of assets (or agreeing to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets) that, in the aggregate, constitute more than 25% of the consolidated gross assets, valued as of the distribution date of the Vistana Spin-Off, of Vistana or collectively of Vistana and its subsidiaries that were its subsidiaries immediately after the effective time of the Vistana acquisition; and\n\u2022\nmerging or consolidating, with any other person (other than pursuant to the Vistana acquisition).\nThese restrictions relate to the fact that even if the Vistana Spin-Off were otherwise to qualify as a tax free reorganization under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, the Vistana Spin-Off would be taxable to Starwood (but not to Starwood shareholders) pursuant to Section 355(e) of the Code if there is a 50% or greater change in ownership of Vistana, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Vistana Spin-Off. For this purpose, any direct or indirect acquisitions of Vistana stock within the period beginning two years before the Vistana Spin-Off and ending two years after the Vistana Spin-Off are presumed to be part of such a plan, although Starwood may, depending on the facts and circumstances, be able to rebut that presumption. The Vistana acquisition was not expected to violate this rule because Starwood shareholders held more than 50% by vote and value of the stock of ILG (and, thus, indirectly, of Vistana) immediately following the Vistana acquisition. However, the ILG Acquisition resulted in further dilution of indirect ownership of Vistana by its former shareholders below 50%, and the IRS might assert that the ILG Acquisition is part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the Vistana Spin-Off and the Vistana Acquisition. If such assertion were sustained, the Vistana Spin-Off would be subject to the application of Section 355(e) of the Code, and we would be liable to indemnify Starwood (or Marriott International) for any resulting tax liability pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement.\nIn addition, if the Vistana Spin-Off is determined to be taxable, in certain circumstances both Starwood and its shareholders could incur significant tax liabilities, and we would be obligated to indemnify Starwood (or Marriott International) for any resulting tax liability.\nThe Tax Matters Agreement permits Vistana to take an otherwise prohibited action described above if Vistana provides Starwood with a tax opinion or Starwood receives a ruling from the IRS that, in each case, is reasonably satisfactory to Starwood to the effect that such action will not affect the tax-free status of the Vistana Spin-Off (or Starwood waives the requirement to obtain such an opinion or ruling). Prior to the signing of the merger agreement with ILG, Starwood agreed in writing to waive those provisions of the Tax Matters Agreement that relate to the signing of the merger agreement and in connection with the consummation of the ILG Acquisition. Such waiver will not relieve us of our obligation to indemnify Starwood (or Marriott International) if the ILG Acquisition causes the Vistana Spin-Off to be taxable.\nWe received an opinion from our tax advisor, KPMG LLP, to the effect that entering into the ILG Acquisition will not affect the tax-free status of the Vistana Spin-Off. Such opinion is not binding on the IRS or any court, and the IRS may assert that the ILG Acquisition caused the Vistana Spin-Off to violate Section 355(e) of the Code and such assertion may ultimately be sustained by any court.", "PERMNO": 13085, "SIC": 7011, "TIC": "VAC"}
