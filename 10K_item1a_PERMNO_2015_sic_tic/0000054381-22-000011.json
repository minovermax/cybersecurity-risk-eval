RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS, THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, OUR PROGRAMS AND OUR CONTRACTS\nOur business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows have been and are expected to continue to be adversely impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nEconomic and health conditions in the United States and across most of the world have changed dramatically since COVID-19 was first discovered in late 2019. The public health issues resulting from COVID-19 and the precautionary measures instituted by governments and businesses to mitigate its spread, such as quarantines, travel restrictions, business curtailments and school closures, have resulted in business and manufacturing disruptions, plant closures, inventory shortages, delivery delays, supply chain disruptions, and order reductions, cancellations and deferrals, all of which have adversely affected our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Although we continue to meet the demands of our customers, we have seen some disruptions in our supply chain, such as delays in materials and components used in our manufacturing process, and we continue to operate below pre-pandemic levels for our commercial aerospace products. We anticipate recoveries in 2022; however, the extent to which COVID-19 may adversely impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, the severity and duration of the pandemic and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain or mitigate its effects. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may experience adverse impacts to our business due to any resulting economic recession or depression. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of COVID-19 have caused extreme volatility in financial and other capital markets which has, and may continue to, adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capital markets. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this report, such as those relating to our products and financial performance.\nOur concentration of sales to a few major direct commercial sales customers under the JPF program puts us at financial risk.\nWe sell the JPF to foreign militaries through direct commercial sales, with reliance on two Middle Eastern customers. During 2021, sales to these customers accounted for approximately 15% of consolidated sales. In addition to being impacted by the cadence of these customers' operations, sales to these customers require export approvals, licenses and other authorizations from the USG. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the necessary approvals, licenses and authorizations. In the event that we are unable to obtain the regulatory approvals, licenses or other authorizations needed to effectuate sales to these Middle Eastern customers, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows would be adversely impacted.\nJPF orders can be quite large, frequently exceeding $50.0 million or more, resulting in significant variations in our cash flows and outstanding accounts receivable. If we are unable to collect the full amount of these, and other JPF receivables, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted.\nA direct commercial sales contract with a Middle Eastern customer is secured by unconditional letters of credit aggregating $86.3 million, which may be drawn upon unilaterally by the customer in the event of a disagreement or alleged failure to perform. Any such draw down, whether warranted or not, would adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nThe U.S. Navy contract award for the FMU-139 D/B bomb fuze could jeopardize the continued viability, profitability and cash flows of the Company's FMU-152 A/B bomb fuze program.\nOur JPF program continues to move through its product lifecycle, reflecting the previously announced decision of the United States Air Force (\"USAF\") to move to the FMU-139 D/B (which we do not produce) as its primary fuze system. During the first quarter of 2021, we completed our delivery requirements under Option 14 of our USG contract and we began to satisfy the requirements under Option 15, which relates solely to the procurement of fuzes by 25 foreign militaries and has an expected value of approximately $57.3 million. In the third quarter of 2021, we received an award under Option 16 with an expected total value of approximately $43.0 million. Similar to Option 15, this order relates solely to the procurement of fuzes by or in support of foreign militaries and does not include any sales to the USAF. Option 16 extends FMU-152 A/B production into 2023. We have been advised by our customer that Option 16 will be the last order under our JPF contract with the USG. We do not expect the close-out of our JPF contract with the USG will adversely impact our ability to continue to market the FMU-152 A/B\ndirectly to foreign militaries in direct commercial sales transactions, and we are currently in discussions with two Middle Eastern customers for one or more follow-on orders aggregating a minimum of $45.0 million. The final value of these orders will be dependent on volume and pricing agreed upon in the completed contracts. If received, these orders would continue to extend the life of the program. As discussed above, these orders would be subject to export approvals, licenses and other authorizations necessary to effectuate the sales, which are subject to political and geopolitical conditions. In the event that foreign militaries move to the FMU-139 D/B and we are unable to successfully market the FMU-152 A/B in direct commercial sales transactions, or are unable to convert our marketing efforts to firm transactions, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be materially adversely impacted.\nWe are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties related to the timing and conditions surrounding the production of the 737 MAX.\nOn March 13, 2019, the Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\") issued an order to suspend operations of all 737 MAX aircraft in the U.S. and by U.S. aircraft operators following two fatal 737 MAX accidents. Non-U.S. civil aviation authorities issued directives to the same effect. Boeing suspended deliveries until the FAA and other civil aviation authorities worldwide grant the clearance to return the aircraft to service and suspended production of the 737 MAX in January 2020 as a result of the ongoing evaluation. In November 2020, the FAA lifted the orders to suspend operations of the Boeing 737 MAX and in early 2021, airlines around the globe began to clear the Boeing 737 MAX for flying. Although production rates increased in 2021 and higher output rates are expected in 2022, there can be no assurance that the production rate will return to the production rate prior to the grounding of the 737 MAX fleet. We have recognized $4.0 million, $5.6 million and $19.9 million in revenue associated with the sale of our products that are utilized on the 737 MAX aircraft fleet in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Any future reductions to the production rate or lower than anticipated production levels than previously anticipated could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows.\nOur financial performance is significantly influenced by conditions within the aerospace and defense industries.\nThe financial performance of our business is directly tied to economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries. The commercial aviation industry tends to be cyclical, and capital spending by airlines and aircraft manufacturers may be influenced by a variety of global factors including current and future traffic levels, aircraft fuel pricing, labor issues, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions, worldwide airline profits and backlog levels. The defense industry may be influenced by a changing global political environment, changes in U.S. and global defense spending, U.S. foreign policy and the activity level of military flight operations. Changes to the aerospace and defense industries and any reductions in U.S. defense spending could have a material impact on our current and proposed aerospace programs, which could adversely affect our operating results and future prospects. In addition, changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled, which could put a portion of our backlog at risk.\nFurthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing new products to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when a new product is introduced. A reduction in capital spending in the aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products, which could have an adverse effect on our financial performance or results of operations.\nOur USG programs are subject to unique risks.\nWe have several significant long-term contracts either directly with the USG or where the USG is the ultimate customer, including the Sikorsky BLACK HAWK cockpit program, the JPF program and the AH-1Z program. These contracts are subject to unique risks, some of which are beyond our control. Examples of such risks include:\n\u2022The USG may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts and subcontracts at its convenience without prior notice, upon payment for work done and commitments made at the time of termination. As discussed above, the Company has been advised by our customer that Option 16, received in the third quarter of 2021, will be the last order under our JPF contract with the USG. Modification, curtailment or termination of our major programs or contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022Our USG business is subject to specific procurement regulations and other requirements. These requirements, although customary in USG contracts, increase our performance and compliance costs. These costs might increase in the future, reducing our margins, which could have a negative effect on our financial condition. Although we have procedures designed to assure compliance with these regulations and requirements, failure to do so under certain circumstances could lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from USG contracting or subcontracting for a period of time and\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and could adversely impact our reputation and our ability to receive other USG contract awards in the future.\n\u2022The costs we incur on our USG contracts, including allocated indirect costs, may be audited by USG representatives. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract would not be reimbursed, and such costs already reimbursed would have to be refunded, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, if any audit were to reveal the existence of improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the USG.\n\u2022We are from time to time subject to governmental inquiries and investigations of our business practices due to our participation in domestic and foreign government contracts and programs and our transaction of business domestically and internationally. Adverse findings associated with any such inquiry or investigation could also result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with domestic and foreign governments.\n\u2022The costs to implement and comply with the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (\"CMMC\") as initiated by the U.S. Department of Defense in order to measure their defense contractors' capabilities, readiness, and sophistication in the area of cybersecurity.\nOur business may be adversely affected by changes in budgetary priorities of the USG.\nBecause a significant percentage of our revenue is derived either directly or indirectly from contracts with the USG, changes in federal government budgetary priorities could directly affect our financial performance. A significant decline in government expenditures, a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support or a change in federal government contracting policies could cause federal government agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts, to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty or not to exercise options to renew contracts.\nEstimates of future costs for long-term contracts impact our current and future operating results and profits.\nWe generally recognize sales and gross margin on long-term contracts based on the over time method of accounting. This method allows for revenue recognition as our work progresses on a contract and requires that we estimate future revenues and costs over the life of a contract. Revenues are estimated based upon the negotiated contract price, with consideration being given to exercised contract options, change orders and, in some cases, projected customer requirements. Contract costs may be incurred over a period of several years, and the estimation of these costs requires significant judgment based upon the acquired knowledge and experience of program managers, engineers and financial professionals.\nEstimated costs are based primarily on anticipated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. The complexity of certain programs as well as technical risks and the availability of materials and labor resources could affect our ability to accurately estimate future contract costs. Additional factors that could affect recognition of revenue and gross margin under this method include:\n\u2022Accounting for initial program costs;\n\u2022The effect of nonrecurring work;\n\u2022Delayed contract start-up or changes to production schedules;\n\u2022Transition of work to or from the customer or other vendors;\n\u2022Claims or unapproved change orders;\n\u2022Product warranty issues;\n\u2022Delayed completion of certain programs for which inventory has been built up;\n\u2022Our ability to estimate or control scrap level;\n\u2022Accrual of contract losses; and\n\u2022Changes in our overhead rates.\nBecause of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes, it is likely that materially different sales and profit amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect current and future financial performance. While we perform quarterly reviews of our long-term contracts to address and lessen the effects of these risks, there can be no assurance that we will not make material adjustments to underlying assumptions or estimates relating to one or more long-term contracts that have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may lose money or generate lower than expected profits on our fixed-price contracts.\nOur customers set demanding specifications for product performance, reliability and cost. Most of our government contracts and subcontracts provide for a predetermined, fixed price for the products we make regardless of the costs we incur. Therefore, we must absorb cost overruns, notwithstanding the difficulty of estimating all of the costs we will incur in performing these contracts and in projecting the ultimate level of sales that we may achieve. Our failure to anticipate technical problems, estimate costs accurately, integrate technical processes effectively or control costs during performance of a fixed-price contract may reduce the profitability of a fixed-price contract or cause a loss. While we believe that we have recorded adequate provisions in our financial statements for losses on our fixed-price contracts as required under GAAP, there can be no assurance that our contract loss provisions will be adequate to cover all actual future losses.\nWe face significant pressure to lower our pricing notwithstanding our own internal costs.\nThere is substantial and continuing pressure from original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\") in the commercial aerospace industry to reduce the prices they pay to suppliers, such as Kaman. We attempt to manage such downward pricing pressure, while trying to preserve our business relationships with our customers, by seeking to reduce our production and procurement costs through various measures, including implementing cost-effective process improvements and partnering with our own suppliers to reduce our cost of raw materials and components. Our suppliers have periodically resisted, and in the future may resist, pressure to lower their prices and may seek to impose price increases. If we are unable to offset price reductions to our OEM customers, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe ability to obtain and retain product approvals issued by the FAA and any intellectual property claims could adversely affect our operating results and profits.\nOur business may be impacted by regulations set forth by the FAA to obtain Parts Manufacturer Approvals (\"PMAs\") to design or produce a modification or replacement aircraft part. The loss or suspension of the Company's product and design approvals could negatively impact our operating results and profits. We believe our current design and production processes that are subject to such regulations by the FAA are in compliance; however, there can be no assurance that we will not lose approvals for our products in the future. Additionally, we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties, including in connection with our PMA business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompetition from domestic and foreign manufacturers may result in the loss of potential contracts and opportunities.\nThe markets in which we participate are highly competitive, and we often compete for work not only with large OEMs but also sometimes with our own customers and suppliers. Many of our large customers may choose not to outsource production due to, among other things, their own direct labor and overhead considerations and capacity utilization objectives. This could result in these customers supplying their own products or services and competing directly with us for sales of these products or services, all of which could significantly reduce our revenues.\nOur competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas, and we may not have the technology, cost structure, or available resources to effectively compete with them. We believe that developing and maintaining a competitive advantage requires continued investment in product development; engineering; supply chain management; production capabilities, including technology, equipment and facilities; and sales and marketing, and we may not have enough resources to make the necessary investments to do so. Further, our significant customers may attempt to use their position to negotiate price or other concessions for a particular product or service without regard to the terms of an existing contract or the underlying cost of production.\nWe believe our strategies for our business will allow us to continue to effectively compete for key contracts and customers, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in this market or against such competitors.\nOur failure to comply with the covenants contained in our credit facility could trigger an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.\nOur credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and comply with various operational and other covenants. If we were unable to maintain these ratios and comply with such covenants, we would need to seek relief from our lenders in order to avoid, cure or have waived an event of default under the facility. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such relief on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise. If an event of default occurs and is not cured or waived, we\nmay not be able to make further borrowings under the credit facility and our lenders could, among other things, cause all outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility to be due and payable immediately. There can be no assurance that our assets or cash flows would be sufficient to provide us with sufficient liquidity to fund outstanding commitments or meet other business requirements or to enable us to fully repay those amounts or that we would be able to refinance or restructure the indebtedness. If, as or when required, we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure the indebtedness outstanding under our senior credit facility, or amend the financial ratios and covenants contained therein, the lenders under our credit facility could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets. This, in turn, could result in an event of default under one or more of our other financing agreements, including our convertible notes.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of business, certain of our customers require us to deliver standby letters of credit to guarantee our performance under our contractual obligations with them, which are currently issued by certain of our lenders pursuant to our credit facility. If we are unable to obtain letters of credit as needed to operate our business as a result of any of the circumstances described above or otherwise, our ability to enter into certain contracts may be adversely affected. Moreover, by their nature, standby letters of credit may be drawn upon by the beneficiaries thereof, which could affect our financial ratios and ability to make additional borrowings. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position or results of operations.\nChanges affecting the availability of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) could affect our financial results.\nThe LIBOR benchmark has been the subject of national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms may cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past, and LIBOR may ultimately cease to exist. Alternative benchmark rate(s) may replace LIBOR and could affect the Company's debt securities, derivative instruments, receivables, debt payments and receipts. An alternative rate may create additional basis risk for market participants as an alternative index is utilized alongside LIBOR. Key regulatory authorities have requested that banks cease entering into new contracts that use U.S. dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d) LIBOR as a reference rate, and do not permit new or existing non-USD LIBOR borrowings, by no later than December 31, 2021. Additionally, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee has recommended replacing USD LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), which is calculated by short-term repurchase agreements. There can be no guarantee that SOFR will become widely used, or that any alternatives may or may not be developed.\nInterest rates on amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement are variable based on LIBOR. In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company amended its Credit Agreement to move its LIBOR benchmark for non-USD borrowings to other non-USD benchmark rates. Future USD borrowings under our current Credit Agreement will continue be based on LIBOR. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any changes to LIBOR, the phase out of LIBOR or any establishment of alternative benchmark rates. Any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate LIBOR exactly, which could impact our contracts that terminate after 2023. There is uncertainty about how applicable law, the courts or the Company will address the replacement of LIBOR with alternative rates on variable rate retail loan contracts and other contracts that do not include alternative rate fallback provisions. In addition, any changes to benchmark rates may have an uncertain impact on our cost of funds and our access to the capital markets, which could impact our liquidity, financial position or results of operations.\nThe freezing of our defined benefit pension plan could trigger a curtailment adjustment in favor of the USG.\nOur defined benefit pension plan was frozen with respect to future benefit accruals effective December 31, 2015. U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standard 413 (\"CAS 413\") requires the Company to determine the USG\u2019s share of any resulting pension curtailment adjustment attributable to pension expense charged to Company contracts with the USG, which could result in an amount due to the USG if the plan is determined to be in a surplus position or an amount due to the Company if the plan is determined to be in a deficit position. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company accrued a $0.3 million liability representing our estimate of the amount due to the USG based on our pension curtailment adjustment calculation, which was submitted to the USG for review in December 2016. The Company has maintained its accrual at $0.3 million as of December 31, 2021. There can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nRISKS RELATED TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND CYBERSECURITY\nCybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and data.\nOur information technology systems provide critical data connectivity, information and services for internal and external users. These interactions include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, inventory management, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements and other processes necessary to manage our business. Our computer systems face the threat of unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, organized cyber-attacks and other security problems and system disruptions. We rely heavily on our information technology systems, networks and services, some of which are managed, hosted and provided by third-parties to conduct our business.\nCyber-attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, destructive malware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, manipulation of data, disruption or denial of service attacks and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential, personal or otherwise protected information, including trade secrets, and corruption of data, networks or systems. We provide products and services to customers who also face cyber threats. Our products and services may be subject to cyber threats and we may not be able to detect or deter such threats, which could result in losses that could adversely affect our customers and our company. For example, in December 2020, Bal Seal identified file encryption activity and ransom notes on systems within its environment indicative of a Doppelpaymer ransomware attack, which disrupted Bal Seal's information technology systems. Although no payments were made to the threat actor, the interruption resulted in a temporary delay of revenue and in the incurrence of incremental costs for the year ended December 31, 2020; however, the incident was not material to the Company's fiscal year 2020 financial results.\nWe could also be impacted by cyber threats in products that we use in our partners' and customers' systems that are used in connection with our business, including threats directed towards our third-party and cloud service providers. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. These events, if not prevented or mitigated, could damage our reputation, require remedial action and lead to loss of business, regulatory actions, potential liability and other financial losses. To address the risks to our information technology systems and data, we manage an information security program, maintain strong incident report capabilities and perform daily off-site backups. Additionally, we have put in place business continuity plans and security precautions for our critical systems, including a back-up data center. Updates on cyber security are provided to the Board of Directors at least annually.\nOur information technology systems, processes and sites may suffer interruptions or failures which may affect our ability to conduct our business.\nIn the event our information technology systems are damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages and security breaches resulting in unauthorized access or cyber-attacks, and our information security program, incident report capabilities, business continuity plans and security precautions do not function effectively on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our operations or the misappropriation of proprietary information, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In December 2020, an unauthorized party disrupted access to Bal Seal's information technology systems. The interruption resulted in a temporary delay of revenue and in the incurrence of incremental costs for the year ended December 31, 2020; however, the incident was not material to the Company's fiscal year 2020 financial results. Bal Seal was able to restore its affected systems and resume business operations in a relatively short period of time.\nAs we outsource our information technology functions and transition to cloud-based technologies, disruptions or delays at our third-party service providers could impact our operations.\nAs part of the comprehensive review of our general and administrative functions in order to improve operational efficiency and to align the Company's costs with its revenues, we identified information technology functions to be outsourced. While we believe we conducted appropriate diligence before entering into agreements with our third-party service providers and have the proper controls and oversight over the IT functions performed by our third parties, the failure of one or more of such entities to meet our performance standards and expectations, with respect to data security, compliance with data protection and privacy laws, providing services on a timely basis or providing services at the prices we expect, may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, we are considering the transition of certain technology to cloud-based infrastructure, which is complex, time consuming, and can involve substantial expenditures. Our utilization of cloud services is critical to developing and providing products and services to our customers, scaling our business for future growth, accurately\nmaintaining data and otherwise operating our business; any such implementation involves risks inherent in the conversion to a new system, including loss of information and potential disruption to our normal operations. We may discover deficiencies in our design or implementation or maintenance of the new cloud-based systems that could adversely affect our business. Upon implementation of the new cloud-based solutions, failure of cloud infrastructure providers to maintain adequate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the security of our confidential information and data could result in unauthorized access to our systems or a system or network disruption that could lead to improper disclosure of confidential information or data, regulatory penalties and remedial costs. There may also be a discrepancy between the contractual liability profile that the cloud service provider has agreed to and our contractual liability profile with our customers. Any disruption to either the outsourced systems or the communication links between us and the outsourced suppliers could negatively affect our ability to operate our data systems, and could impair our ability to provide services to our customers. As we increase our reliance on these third-party systems, our exposure to damage from service disruptions may increase and we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions.\nRISKS RELATED TO COMPLIANCE\nExports of certain of our products are subject to various export control regulations and authorizations, and we may not be successful in obtaining the necessary U.S. Government approvals and resultant export licenses for proposed sales to certain foreign customers.\nWe must comply with numerous laws and regulations relating to the export of our products and technologies, including, among others, the FMU-152A/B JPF, before we are permitted to sell those products and technologies outside of the United States. Compliance often entails the submission and timely receipt of necessary export approvals, licenses or authorizations from the USG and, depending on the size and nature of the proposed transaction, may even require the submission of formal notification to the United States Congress, which then has the ability to pass a joint resolution of disapproval blocking or amending the sale. Over the last several years, the U.S. export licensing environment for munitions, such as the JPF, has been adversely affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the changing geopolitical environment and heightened tensions with other countries (which shift and evolve over time). Accordingly, we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining, in a timely manner or at all, the approvals, licenses or authorizations we need to sell our products and technologies outside the United States, which may result in the cancellation of orders, the incurrence of significant penalties payable by the Company and the return of advance payments to our customers if we do not make deliveries and fulfill our contractual commitments. Any significant delay in, or impairment of, our ability to sell products or technologies outside of the United States could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTariffs on certain imports to the United States and other potential changes to U.S. tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on global economic conditions and our business, financial results and financial condition.\nIn 2018, tariffs were implemented on imports of steel and aluminum into the United States. As the implementation of tariffs is ongoing, more tariffs may be added in the future. While any steel and aluminum we use in our products is produced primarily in North America, the tariffs may provide domestic steel and aluminum producers the flexibility to increase their prices, at least to a level where their products would still be priced below foreign competitors once the tariffs are taken into account. These tariffs could have an adverse impact on our financial results, which include, but are not limited to, products we sell that include steel and aluminum, and if we are unable to pass such price increases through to our customers, it would likely increase our cost of sales and, as a result, decrease our gross margins, operating income and net income. To date, the impact of the tariffs has not been material to the Company. In addition, in response to the tariffs, a number of other countries are threatening to impose tariffs on U.S. imports, which, if implemented, could increase the price of our products in these countries and may result in our customers looking to alternative sources for our products. This would result in decreased sales, which could have a negative impact on our net income and financial condition. Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to suppliers or customers and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to litigation, tax, environmental, safety and health and other legal compliance risks that could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are subject to a variety of litigation, tax and legal compliance risks. These risks include, among other things, possible liability relating to contract-related claims, government contracts, product liability matters, personal injuries, workplace health and safety, intellectual property rights, taxes, employment, environmental matters and compliance with U.S. and foreign export laws, competition laws, laws governing improper business practices and data privacy laws, including the EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation (the \"GDPR\") and the California Consumer Privacy Act. In the event that we or one of our business units engage in wrongdoing in connection with any of these kinds of matters, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments, other damages (in certain cases, treble damages), or suspension or debarment from government contracts.\nMoreover, our failure to comply with applicable export and trade practice laws could result in civil or criminal penalties and suspension or termination of export privileges. In the fourth quarter of 2021, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") issued citations to one of our business units, which resulted in penalties. Although the penalties were not material to the Company's 2021 financial results, non-compliance, including any future instances of non-compliance with OSHA regulations, could result in substantial costs and liabilities, and could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate. Those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. They may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by the outcome of pending legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted. In accordance with GAAP, if a liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time, we make an estimate of material loss contingencies and establish reserves based on our assessment. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment. The accrual of a loss contingency adversely affects our results of operations in the period in which a liability is recognized. This could also have an adverse impact on our cash flows in the period during which damages are paid.\nFor a discussion of these matters, please refer to Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 13, Environmental Costs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur foreign operations require us to comply with a number of United States and international laws and regulations, violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are required to comply with a number of United States and international laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the \"FCPA\"), the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 (the \"Bribery Act\"), and other similar anticorruption laws and regulations. The FCPA generally prohibits United States companies or their agents and employees from providing anything of value to a foreign official for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business, direct business to any person or corporate entity or obtain any unfair advantage. Although we have internal controls, procedures and compliance programs to train our employees and agents with respect to compliance with the FCPA and other applicable international laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our policies, procedures and programs will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Allegations of violations of applicable international laws and regulations, including the FCPA and the Bribery Act, may result in internal, independent or government investigations. Violations of the FCPA and other international laws and regulations may lead to severe criminal or civil sanctions and could result in liabilities that have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur foreign operations present additional risks and uncertainties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur foreign business operations create additional risks and uncertainties, including the following:\n\u2022Longer payment cycles;\n\u2022Difficulties in accounts receivable collection, including complexities in documenting letters of credit;\n\u2022Changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022Export restrictions, tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022Seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in Europe and certain other parts of the world;\n\u2022Political or economic instability in the markets we serve;\n\u2022Potentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022Cultural and legal differences impacting the conduct of business.\nIn addition, our contracts with foreign customers may include terms and reflect legal requirements that create additional risks. These include, among others, industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific in-country purchases, investments, manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations, known as offset requirements, and provide for significant penalties if we fail to meet such requirements. Certain of our foreign customers have required us to enter into letters of credit, performance or surety bonds, bank guarantees and/or other financial arrangements to secure our performance obligations. All or any of these factors have the potential to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe design, manufacture, service and sell complex aerospace parts, subassemblies and aircraft that subject us to potential risks and liabilities in the event they do not operate as intended.\nThe Company designs, manufactures, services and sells complex and sophisticated aerospace parts, subassemblies and aircraft. These products are manufactured according to detailed specifications and are subject to strict approval or certification requirements. From time to time, the Company's products may not operate as intended due to defects or failures. Due to the nature of the Company's business, liability claims may arise from accidents or disasters involving products the Company has manufactured, including claims for serious injury or death. Such accidents may be caused by environmental factors or human error. While management believes that the Company maintains adequate insurance for these risks, insurance cannot be obtained to protect against all risks and liabilities. It is therefore possible that the insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities, and the Company may be forced to bear substantial unanticipated costs. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of investigations or litigation, in the opinion of management, any payments we may be required to make as a result of all such claims in existence at December 31, 2021, are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or cash flows.\nAdditional tax exposure and tax law changes could have a material effect on our financial results.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. The determination of the Company\u2019s provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires judgment and is based on legislative and regulatory structures that exist in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and we are periodically under audit by various tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We are currently under audit by various foreign and state tax authorities for the years 2016 through 2019. Although we do not believe that any material adjustments will result from these audits, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. Any final assessment resulting from tax audits may result in material changes to our past or future taxable income, tax payable or deferred tax assets and may require us to pay penalties and interest that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe value of our deferred tax assets could become impaired, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $9.2 million in net deferred tax assets after valuation allowance. These deferred tax assets can be used to offset taxable income in future periods and reduce income taxes payable in those future periods. Each quarter, we determine the probability of the realization of deferred tax assets, using significant judgments and estimates with respect to, among other things, historical operating results, expectations of future earnings and tax planning strategies. In the event that there is insufficient positive evidence to support the valuation of these assets, we may be required to further adjust the valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. Such a reduction could result in a material non-cash charge in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES, DIVESTITURES AND RESTRUCTURING\nWe may make acquisitions or investments in new businesses, products or technologies that involve additional risks, which could disrupt our business or harm our financial condition or results of operations.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made, and expect to continue to make, acquisitions of businesses or investments in companies that offer complementary products, services and technologies. Such acquisitions or investments involve a number of risks, including:\n\u2022Assimilating operations and products may be unexpectedly difficult;\n\u2022Management's attention may be diverted from other business concerns;\n\u2022We may enter markets in which we have limited or no direct experience;\n\u2022We may lose key employees, customers or vendors of an acquired business;\n\u2022We may not be able to achieve the synergies or cost savings we anticipated;\n\u2022We may not realize the assigned value of the acquired assets;\n\u2022We may experience quality control failures or encounter other customer relationship issues; and\n\u2022We may become subject to preexisting liabilities and obligations of the acquired businesses.\nThese factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the consideration paid for any future acquisitions could include our stock or require that we incur additional debt and contingent liabilities. As a result, future acquisitions could cause dilution of existing equity interests and earnings per share.\nCertain of our operations are conducted through joint ventures, which entail special risks.\nThe Company has a 49% equity interest in Kineco-Kaman Composites - India Private Limited, a composites manufacturing joint venture located in Goa, India. The Company relies significantly on the services and skills of its joint venture partner to manage and conduct the local business operations of the joint venture and ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. If our joint venture partner fails to perform these functions adequately, it may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, if our joint venture partner fails to honor its financial obligations to commit capital, equity or credit support to the joint venture as a result of financial or other difficulties or for any other reason, the joint venture may be unable to perform contracted services or deliver contracted products unless we provide the necessary capital, equity or credit support.\nWe may be unable to realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability may be hurt or business otherwise might be adversely affected.\nIn order to operate more efficiently and control costs, from time to time, we announce restructuring plans or other cost savings initiatives, which include workforce reductions as well as facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives, such as streamlining our processes. These plans are intended to generate operating expense savings through direct cost and indirect overhead expense reductions, as well as other savings. We may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future. These types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex. If we do not successfully manage our current initiatives and restructuring activities or any other similar activities that we may undertake in the future, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. Risks associated with these initiatives, actions and other workforce management issues include political responses to such actions, unforeseen delays in the implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, changes in responsibilities, business and information technology systems disruptions, changes in internal controls, potential impacts on financial reporting, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets, whether due to the loss of employees, work stoppages or otherwise, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated sales or cost reductions and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nOur future operating results will be impacted by changes in global economic and political conditions.\nOur future operating results and liquidity are expected to be impacted by changes in general economic and political conditions which may affect, among other things, the following:\n\u2022The availability of credit and our ability to obtain additional or renewed bank financing, the lack of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and may limit our ability to invest in capital projects and planned expansions or to fully execute our business strategy;\n\u2022Market rates of interest, any increase in which would increase the interest payable on some of our borrowings and adversely impact our cash flow;\n\u2022The investment performance of our pension plan, as well as the associated discount rate, any adverse changes in which may result in a deterioration in the funded status of the plan and an increase in required contributions and plan expense;\n\u2022The relationship between the U.S. dollar and other currencies, any adverse changes in which could negatively impact our financial results;\n\u2022The ability of our customers to pay for products and services on a timely basis, any adverse change in which could negatively impact sales and cash flows and require us to increase our bad debt reserves;\n\u2022The volume of orders we receive from our customers, any adverse change in which could result in lower operating profits as well as less absorption of fixed costs due to a decreased business base;\n\u2022The ability of our suppliers to meet our demand requirements, maintain the pricing of their products or continue operations, any of which may require us to find and qualify new suppliers;\n\u2022The issuance and timely receipt of necessary export approvals, licenses and authorizations from the U.S. Government, the lack or untimely receipt of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations; and\n\u2022The political stability and leadership of countries where our customers reside, including military activity, training and threat levels, any adverse changes in which could negatively impact our financial results.\nWhile general economic and political conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations to date, there can be no assurance that we will not experience future adverse effects that may be material to our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition, results of operations or our ability to access capital.\nWe could be negatively impacted by the loss of key suppliers, the consolidation of suppliers, the lack of product availability or changes in supplier programs or prices.\nOur business depends on maintaining a sufficient supply of various products to meet our customers' demands. We have long-standing relationships with key suppliers but these relationships generally are non-exclusive and could be terminated by either party. If we were to lose a key supplier, or were unable to obtain the same levels of deliveries from these suppliers and were unable to supplement those purchases with products obtained from other suppliers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, we rely on foreign and domestic suppliers and commodity markets to secure raw materials used in many of the products we manufacture. Suppliers have consolidated and formed alliances to broaden their product and integrated system offerings, and achieve critical mass. Supplier consolidation could cause us to compete against certain competitors with greater financial resources, market penetration and purchasing power. This exposes us to volatility in the price and availability of raw materials. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply. Supply interruptions could arise from shortages of raw materials, labor disputes or worker resignations, weather conditions or pandemics, such as disruptions we have seen due to the effects of COVID-19, affecting suppliers' production, transportation disruptions or other reasons beyond our control. Even if we continue with our current supplier relationships, high demand for certain products may result in us being unable to meet our customers' demands, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Additionally, our key suppliers could also increase the pricing of their products, which would negatively affect our operating results if we were not able to pass these price increases through to our customers. Price increases may intensify or occur more frequently as demand for raw materials and components increase, or as disruptions occur within the supply chain. The prices for our products fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand, and we may be required to absorb the cost increase. We base our supply management process on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. To protect ourselves against such risks, we may engage in strategic inventory purchases during the year, negotiate long-term vendor supply agreements, monitor our inventory levels and obtain second sources when applicable to ensure that we have the appropriate inventory on hand to meet our customers' requirements.\nWe may not realize all of the sales expected from our existing backlog or anticipated orders.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had $700.9 million of order backlog. There can be no assurance that the revenues included in our backlog will be realized or, if realized will result in profits. We consider backlog to be firm customer orders. OEM customers may provide projections of components and assemblies that they anticipate purchasing in the future under existing programs. These projections may represent orders that are beyond lead time and are included in backlog when supported by a long term agreement. Our customers have the right under certain circumstances or with certain penalties or consequences to terminate, reduce or defer firm orders that we have in backlog. If our customers terminate, reduce or defer firm orders, we may be protected from certain costs and losses, but our sales would be adversely affected. Although we strive to maintain ongoing relationships with our customers, there is an ongoing risk that orders may be canceled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers\u2019 business needs or purchasing budgets.\nOur revenue, cash flows and quarterly results may fluctuate, which could adversely affect our stock price.\nWe may in the future experience significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results attributable to a variety of factors. Such factors include but are not limited to:\n\u2022Changes in demand for our products;\n\u2022Introduction, enhancement or announcement of products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022Market acceptance of our new products;\n\u2022The growth rates of certain market segments in which we compete;\n\u2022Size, timing and shipment terms of significant orders;\n\u2022Difficulties with our technical programs;\n\u2022Budgeting cycles of customers;\n\u2022Pricing pressures from customers;\n\u2022Customer advances;\n\u2022Longer payment terms required by our customers;\n\u2022Mix of distribution channels;\n\u2022Mix of products and services sold;\n\u2022Mix of domestic and international revenues;\n\u2022Fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022Changes in the level of operating expenses;\n\u2022Changes in our sales and management incentive plans;\n\u2022Changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business;\n\u2022Timing of tax payments, assessments and settlements;\n\u2022Inventory obsolescence;\n\u2022Accrual of contract losses;\n\u2022Fluctuations in oil and utility costs;\n\u2022Health care reform;\n\u2022Completion or announcement of acquisitions or divestitures\n\u2022Timing of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022General economic conditions in regions in which we conduct business.\nMost of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short-term, including costs of personnel and facilities, and are not easily reduced. Thus, an unexpected reduction in our revenue, or failure to achieve an anticipated rate of growth, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. If our operating results do not meet the expectations of investors, our stock price may decline.\nOur financial results of operations could be adversely affected by impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets.\nWhen we acquire a business, we record goodwill equal to the excess of the amount we pay for the business, including liabilities assumed, over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets of the business we acquire. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives must be evaluated at least annually for impairment. The specific guidance for testing goodwill and other non-amortized intangible assets for impairment requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions when allocating goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of reporting unit net assets and liabilities, including, among other things, an assessment of market conditions, projected cash flows, investment rates, cost of capital and growth rates, which could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets. Changes in our estimates and assumptions could adversely impact projected cash flows and the fair value of reporting units. Fair value is generally determined using a combination of the discounted cash flow, market multiple and market capitalization valuation approaches. Absent any impairment indicators, we generally perform our evaluations annually in the fourth quarter, using available forecast information. If at any time we determine an impairment has occurred, we are required to reflect the reduction in value as an expense within operating income, resulting in a reduction of earnings and a corresponding reduction in our net asset value in the period such impairment is identified. We did not identify any indications of impairment in our 2021 evaluation.\nThe cost and effort to start up new programs and introduce new products and technologies could negatively impact our operating results and profits.\nThe time required and costs incurred to ramp up a new program can be significant and include nonrecurring costs for tooling, first article testing, finalizing drawings and engineering specifications and hiring new employees able to perform the technical work required. New programs can typically involve a greater volume of scrap, higher costs due to inefficiencies, delays in production and learning curves that are often more extended than anticipated, all of which could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe also seek to achieve growth through the design, development, production, sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies. The product, program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly and we invest in research and development efforts to pursue advances in technologies, products and services. We are currently developing the next generation TITAN UAV aerial system that will allow K-MAX\u00ae aircraft operators to have the ability to fly either manned or unmanned missions. We are on contract for five orders as of December 31, 2021, which allow for a short time frame to develop and manufacture the unmanned aircraft systems. If any of our development and/or production efforts are delayed, if suppliers cannot deliver timely or perform to our standards and/or if we identify or experience any other issues, we\nmay not meet delivery schedules agreed upon with our customers, which could result in material additional costs, including liquidated damages or other liabilities that could be assessed.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements depends on a variety of factors, including meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules; execution of internal and external performance plans; availability of supplier and internal facility capacity to perform maintenance, repair, and overhaul services on our products; hiring and training of qualified personnel; achieving cost and production efficiencies, identification of emerging technological trends in our target end markets; validation of innovative technologies; the level of customer interest in new technologies and products; and customer acceptance of products we manufacture. Development efforts divert resources from potential resources in our businesses, and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. Additionally, the markets for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate. We may encounter difficulties in developing and/or producing new products or services and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences. Due to the design complexity of our products, we may experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. Delays could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects. Furthermore, our competitors or customers may develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance or instead of our products. Additionally, our competitors may develop new technologies or offerings that may cause our existing technologies or offerings to become obsolete. These risks associated with efforts to start up new programs and introduce new products and technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on the experience and expertise of our skilled employees, and must continue to attract and retain qualified technical, marketing and managerial personnel in order to succeed.\nOur future success will depend largely upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, operational and financial managers and marketing personnel. There is significant competition for such personnel in the industries in which we operate. We try to ensure that we offer competitive compensation and benefits as well as opportunities for continued development, and we continually strive to recruit and train qualified personnel and retain key employees. We may be impacted by higher labor costs and/or labor shortages due to wage and salary inflationary pressures in the economy, a tightening labor market and increased rates of employee resignations generally throughout the U.S. economy. As part of our effort to retain personnel, the Company initiated an All-Employee Engagement Survey in 2021. The survey was used as a tool to measure and improve engagement and satisfaction while helping management discover areas and topics where more dialogue and conversation may be needed. Despite our efforts, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we require to develop new and enhanced products and to continue to grow and operate profitably.\nWe depend on our intellectual property, and have access to certain intellectual property and information of our customers and suppliers and any infringement or failure to protect such intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, physical and information technology security systems, internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property, data, and technology rights, both domestically and internationally, as well as the intellectual property, data and technology rights of our customers and suppliers that we have in our possession or to which we have access. Our efforts to protect such intellectual property, data and technology rights may not be sufficient. There can be no assurance that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us, that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property, data and technology rights may be limited in certain countries outside the U.S. as may be our ability to prevent theft or compromise of our intellectual property, data and technology rights by competitors, state actors or third parties. In addition, we may be the target of competitor or other third-party patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or seeking to prevent our sale and marketing of certain of our products or services. Our competitive position also may be adversely impacted by limitations on our ability to obtain possession of, and ownership or necessary licenses concerning, data important to the development or provision of our products or service offerings, or by limitations on our ability to restrict the use by others of data related to our products or services. Any of these events or factors could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously affect our sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses.\nOur business may be impacted by disruptions including, but not limited to, threats to physical security, information technology attacks or failures, damaging weather or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises. Any of these disruptions could affect our internal operations or services provided to customers, and could impact our sales, increase our expenses or adversely affect our reputation or our stock price. We have developed and are implementing business continuity plans for each of our businesses, in order to mitigate the effects disruptions may have on our financial results.\nA failure to maintain effective internal controls could adversely affect our ability to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.\nOur ability to provide assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud depends on effective internal controls. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements; therefore, even effective controls can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If our internal controls were to be compromised, our financial statements could become materially misleading, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Any material weakness could adversely impact investor confidence in the accuracy of our financial statements, affecting our ability to obtain additional financing. This would likely have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and the market value of our stock. Additionally, we would be required to incur costs to make the necessary improvements to our internal control systems.\nAlthough management has assessed our internal control over financial reporting as effective based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations - Integrated Framework, we can give no assurance that material weaknesses will not occur in the future nor that existing controls will continue to be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or ensure fair presentation of our financial statements in the future.\nThe adoption of new accounting guidance or changes in the interpretations of existing guidance could affect our financial results.\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, may retroactively affect previously reported results, could cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and may require us to make costly changes to our operational processes and accounting systems.\nOur business could be impacted as a result of actions by activist shareholders or others.\nWe may be subject, from time to time, to legal and business challenges in the operation of our company due to actions instituted by activist shareholders or others. Responding to such actions could be costly and time-consuming, may not align with our business strategies and could divert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of shareholder activism may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business or other instability and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners and may affect our relationships with vendors, customers and other third parties.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis report contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
