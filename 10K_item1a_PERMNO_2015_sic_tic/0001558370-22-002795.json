{"cik": "1013880", "company": "TTEC Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-03", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties discussed in this section when evaluating our business. If any of these risks or uncertainties actually occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations (including revenue, profitability and cash flows) could be materially and adversely affected, and the market price of our stock could decline.\nRISK RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND OUR STRATEGY\nIf we are unsuccessful in implementing our business strategy, our long-term business and financial prospects could be affected\nOur growth strategy is based on continuous diversification of our business beyond contact center customer care outsourcing to an integrated CXaaS platform that unites innovative and disruptive technologies, CX consulting, data analytics, client growth solutions, and customer experience focused system design and integration enabled through industry focused client relationships, continuous technology innovation, scaled delivery footprint, CX partner ecosystem, and strategic M&A. Failure to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics may impact our financial results of operations. Our investments in technologies and integrated solution development may not lead to increased revenue and profitability. If we are not successful in creating value from these investments, there could be a negative impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur markets are highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively\nThe markets where we offer our services are highly competitive. Our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully in markets we currently serve, while expanding into new, profitable markets. We compete with large multinational service providers; offshore service providers from lower-cost jurisdictions that offer similar services, often at highly competitive prices and aggressive contract terms; niche solution providers that compete with us in specific geographic markets, industry segments or service areas; companies that utilize new, potentially disruptive technologies or delivery models, including AI powered solutions; and in-house functions of large companies that use their own resources, rather than outsourcing the customer care and customer experience services we provide. Some of our competitors have greater financial or marketing resources than we do and, therefore, may be better able to compete.\nFurther, the continuing trend of consolidation among business process outsourcing competitors may result in new competitors with greater scale, a broader footprint, better technologies, or efficiencies that may be attractive to our clients and impact our business. If we are unable to compete successfully and provide our clients with superior service and solutions at competitive prices, we could lose market share and clients to competitors, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we cannot adapt our service offerings to changes in technology and market expectations, our ability to grow and our results of operations may be affected\nOur growth and profitability will depend on our ability to develop and adopt new technologies that expand our existing offerings by leveraging new trends in technology and cost efficiencies in our operations, while meeting rapidly evolving client expectations. As technology evolves, more tasks currently performed by our agents may be replaced by automation, robotics, AI, chatbots and other technology solutions, which puts our lower-skill tier one customer care offerings at risk. These technology innovations could potentially reduce our business volumes and related revenues, unless we are successful in adapting and deploying technology profitably.\nWe may not be successful in anticipating or responding to our client expectations and interests in adopting evolving technology solutions, and their integration in our offerings may not achieve the intended enhancements or cost reductions. Services and technologies offered by our competitors may make our service offerings not competitive, or even obsolete, and may negatively impact our clients\u2019 interest in our offerings. Our failure to innovate, maintain technological advantages, or respond effectively and timely to transformational changes in technology could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWhile our business has not been materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic to date, it may be impacted in the future due to the resurgence of the virus in different variants, reluctance of employees to return to brick-and-mortar sites, or impact of the pandemic on our clients\u2019 businesses\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Within weeks of this announcement, travel bans, the state of emergency, quarantines, lockdowns, \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders, and business restrictions and shutdowns were issued in most countries where TTEC does business. These restrictions eased during the summer of 2020 and continued to eb and flow thereafter as the rates of COVID-19 infections, the emergence of new variants of the virus, the vaccine roll-outs and adoption impacted populations and healthcare directives in many parts of the world where TTEC does business. While TTEC was able to adjust to the impacts of the pandemic without material adverse impacts to our business through the end of 2021 and to date, we are unable to accurately predict the full impact the COVID-19 pandemic, and measures being taken to respond to its effects, will have on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties in the future.\nSporadic travel and other business restrictions triggered by COVID-19 related news around the world, changes in consumer behavior due to the pandemic and related unemployment, and supply chain distortions due to COVID-19 labor market disruptions are likely to continue to affect certain of our clients and their business volumes in 2022. Although our revenue from these clients did not decrease during the height of the pandemic as clients invested in their customer relationships to adjust to the changing business realities, there can be no assurance that this revenue will not be impacted on a going forward basis. We may also experience payment defaults or bankruptcy of some of our clients whose business has been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, which could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operation.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, global government-mandated restrictions on business adopted to contain it, and growing inflation due to pandemic related government subsidies may result in a global economic downturn, which could affect demand for our services and impact our results of operations and financial condition, even after the pandemic is contained and the business restrictions are lifted.\nAs our work from home delivery grows, our operations are subject to new untested risks\nIn connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, TTEC expanded its work from home environment and transitioned approximately 80% of our global workforce to work remotely; and most employees that we hired in 2020 and 2021 were hired to work from home. Although some of these employees will return to conventional delivery sites and offices, once the pandemic is under control, many of our employees may continue to work remotely for the foreseeable future. Certain jurisdictions where we do business have regulations specific to work from home, which add complexity and cost to our service delivery. Some of the services we provide are subject to stringent regulatory requirements, and our inability to continuously observe how our agents deliver services when working from home may impact our compliance. Service delivery from home, in certain of our lines of business, may also expose TTEC, our clients, and their customers to a heighten risk of fraud because our ability to detect inappropriate behavior early is impacted by limitation in our inability to continuously observe employees as they deliver services. Employees who work from home rely on residential communication networks and internet providers that may not be as resilient as commercial networks and providers and may be more susceptible to service interruptions and cyberattacks than commercial systems; which may also make our enterprise information technology systems, when interfacing with these residential environments, vulnerable. Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans, which have been historically developed and tested with focus on centralized delivery locations, may not work effectively in a distributed work from home delivery model, where weather impacts, network and power grid downtime may be difficult to manage and where system redundancies are not possible. Over the years, TTEC established strong operational and administrative controls over our business; and our controls, designed for brick-and-mortar environment, may not always provide effective safeguards for a large-scale work from home delivery model. We may not be effective in timely updating our existing controls nor implementing new controls, tailored to the work from home environment. For these and other reasons, our clients may be unwilling to continue to allow us to deliver our services remotely. If we are unable to manage our work from home environment effectively to address these and other risks unique to remote service delivery or if we cannot maintain client confidence in our work from home environment, our reputation and results of operations may be impacted.\nRemote work by majority of our employee population for an extended period of time may impact TTEC culture, and employee engagement with our company, which could affect productivity and our ability to retain employees who are critical to our operations. As the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic recede, some of our clients may wish to return to more traditional brick and mortar service delivery models. Meanwhile, our employees, many of whom prefer the new remote work model, may be unwilling to return to brick and mortar customer experience centers, thus disrupting our ability to deliver services. As our employees, our clients and the economy transition to post COVID-19 realities, we may be unable to accurately predict full impact on our operations, timely adjust our costs and service delivery patterns and that may impact our financial results of operations.\nInflation and changes in the cost or availability of labor, energy, and other operational necessities could adversely affect our results of operations\nWe are currently experiencing inflationary pressures on our operating costs. Competition for labor in many jurisdictions where we operate is becoming more acute and we have experienced increased labor costs as a result. Inflation could also lead to material increases in our other critical operating costs, such as cost of energy, third-party software and systems, real estate and other necessary supplies and services. Many of our long-term contracts do not allow for escalation of fees as our operating costs increase; and those that do allow for such escalations do not always allow increases at rates comparable to increases that we are experiencing now and likely to experience in the future. There is no assurance that we will be able to fully offset any cost increases through cost management or price increases, especially given the current highly competitive business process outsourcing and technology environments. Our clients are also experiencing inflationary pressures and faced with price increases may elect to take-over the delivery of some of the services that we historically perform for them. If we are not able to increase our pricing or otherwise offset our increased costs while maintaining our market share, our operating results and profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur inability to forecast demand, staffing levels, sites and work from home delivery mix could impact our financial results of operations\nPredicting customer demand, making timely staffing level decisions, investments in our customer experience centers and our work from home technologies are important to our successful execution and profitability maximization. We can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to achieve or maintain desired customer experience center site capacity utilization and work from home delivery mix, because quarterly variations in client volumes and client sentiment toward work from home delivery, can have a material adverse effect on our delivery platform and our utilization rates. The use of site utilization rate as a meaningful metric for business process outsourcing organizations is undergoing a review in light of the changes to the business introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic and transition of customer engagement center employees to work from home. If our utilization rates are below expectations and we are unable to right size our real estate commitments in the short term, our high fixed costs of operation, may cause our financial conditions and results of operations to be adversely affected.\nThe social distancing rules and other government mandates that continue during the sustained pandemic impacted the structure and configuration of our large-scale facilities, where employees work in close proximity to each other. These new regulatory requirements forced TTEC to make investments to reconfigure our existing customer experience centers and to accept lower capacity utilization than the utilization priced under our multi-year contracts. If we are unable to renegotiate our contracts to recoup these additional costs, manage these costs by continuing to maintain a large work at home delivery platform, or adjust our cost structure to absorb them, our margins and profitability will be impacted and will result in adverse impact on our results of operations.\nA large portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of clients and the loss of one or more of these clients could adversely affect our business\nWe rely on strategic, long-term relationships with large, global companies in targeted industries and certain agencies of the United States and state and local governments. As a result, we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from relatively few clients. Our five and ten largest clients collectively represented 38% and 49% of our revenue in 2021, with one client representing over 10% of our revenue.\nWhile we have multiple engagements with our largest clients and all contracts are unlikely to terminate at the same time, the contracts with our five largest clients expire between 2022 and 2023 and there can be no assurance that these contracts will continue to be renewed at all or be renewed on favorable terms. While our ongoing sales and marketing activities aim to add new opportunities with existing and new commercial and public sector clients, there can be no assurances that such additional work can be secured or that it would yield financial benefits comparable to expiring contracts. The loss of all or part of major clients\u2019 business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, if the loss of revenue is not replaced with profitable business from other clients.\nWe serve clients in industries that have historically experienced a significant level of consolidation. If one of our clients is acquired (including by another of our clients) our business volumes and revenue may materially decrease due to the termination or phase out of an existing client contract, volume discounts, or other contract concessions which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we cannot recruit, hire, train, and retain qualified employees to respond to client demands at the right price point, our business will be adversely affected\nOur business is labor intensive and our ability to recruit and train employees with the right skills, at the right price point, and in the timeframe required by our client commitments is critical to achieving our growth objectives. Demand for qualified personnel with multi-language capabilities and fluency in English may exceed supply. While we invest in employee retention, our industry is known for high employee turnover and we are continuously recruiting and training replacement staff.\nWe sign multi-year client contracts that are priced based on prevailing labor rates in jurisdictions where we deliver services. In the United States, however, our business is confronted with a patchwork of ever-changing minimum wage, mandatory time off, paid medical and pandemic quarantine leaves, and rest and meal break laws at the state and local levels. As these jurisdiction-specific laws change with little notice or grace period for transition, we often have no opportunity to adjust and change how we do business or pass cost increases to our clients.\nThe United States and other governments in jurisdictions where we hire employees adopted income support measures aimed at supporting citizens who lost their jobs due to COVID-19 pandemic. Although most of these support measures terminated in 2021, prolonged unemployment provided potential TTEC employment prospects with an opportunity to consider self-employment, employment outside of customer experience industry, or caused them to reconsider employment altogether. These comprehensive changes in many labor markets critical for our business may make it more difficult for us to hire a sufficient number of employees to deliver our contractual commitments. Inflationary wage pressures in many jurisdictions where we hire may make it difficult for TTEC to meet our contractual commitments on multi-year client contracts that do not have wage escalation provisions or may make such contracts not profitable.\nThe frequent changes in the laws, inconsistencies in laws across different jurisdictions, state and federal $15/hour+ wage and right to organize initiatives, supported by the Biden administration and many state governments, may result in higher costs, lower contract profitability, higher turnover, and reduced operational efficiencies, which could, in the aggregate, have material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur sales cycles for new client relationships, for new lines of business with existing clients, and for public sector clients can be long, which results in a long lead time before we receive revenue\nWe often face a long selling cycle to secure contracts with new clients or contracts for new lines of business with existing clients. When we are successful in securing a new engagement, it is generally followed by a long implementation period when clients must give notice to incumbent service providers or transfer in-house operations to us. There may also be a long ramp up period before we commence our services, and for certain contracts we receive no revenue until we start performing the work. If we are not successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the initial prolonged sales cycle, or in maintaining the contractual relationship for a period of time necessary to offset new project investment costs and appropriate return on that investment, the investments may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur growth strategy includes the expansion of our offerings to public sector clients by contracting with new clients and through acquisitions. The procurement process for government entities is often more challenging than contracting in the private sector and is different from our standard Engage and Digital business practices, including upfront investment to position for opportunities and respond to requests for proposal. If we are unable to manage our public sector business development effectively and are not successful in winning work, despite the investments we make, our public sector work can adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur growth of operations and geographic footprint expansion could strain our resources and negatively impact our business\nWe plan to continue growing our business through the growth of clients\u2019 wallet share, increasing sales efforts, geographic expansion, and strategic acquisitions, while maintaining tight controls on our expenses and overhead. Lean overhead functions combined with significant growth targets may place a strain on our management systems, infrastructure, and resources, resulting in internal control failures, missed opportunities, and staff attrition. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe routinely consider strategic transactions and may enter into such transactions any time and such transactions may negatively impact our business and create unanticipated risks\nWe continuously analyze strategic opportunities that we believe could provide value for our stockholders, and have acquisitions, divestitures, and potential business combinations in various stages of active review. There can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to identify strategic transaction opportunities that complement our strategy and are available at valuation levels accretive to our business.\nEven if we are successful in identifying and executing these transactions, they may subject our business to risks that could impact our results of operation, including:\n\u2022Inability to integrate acquired companies effectively and realize anticipated synergies and benefits from the acquisitions;\n\u2022Diversion of management\u2019s attention to the integration of the acquired businesses at the expense of delivering results for the legacy business;\n\u2022Inability to appropriately scale critical resources to support the business of the expanded enterprise and other unforeseen challenges of operating the acquired business as part of TTEC\u2019s operations;\n\u2022Inability to retain key employees of the acquired businesses and/or inability of such key employees to be effective as part of TTEC operations;\n\u2022Impact of liabilities or ethical issues of the acquired businesses undiscovered or underestimated as part of the acquisition due diligence;\n\u2022Failure to realize anticipated growth opportunities from a combined business, because existing and potential clients may be unwilling to consolidate business with a single service provider or to stay with the acquirer post acquisition;\n\u2022Impacts of cash on hand and debt incurred to finance acquisitions, thus reducing liquidity for other significant strategic objectives;\n\u2022Inadequate or ineffective internal controls, disclosure controls, corruption prevention policies, human resources and other key policies and practices of the acquired companies; and\n\u2022Reduced revenue and income and resultant stock price impact due to divestiture transactions.\nWhile we consider these transactions to improve our business, financial results, and shareholder value over time, there can be no assurance that our goals will be realized.\nIncreases in the cost of third-party communication and data services or significant interruptions in such services could adversely affect our business\nOur business is significantly dependent on internet, data, and telephone services provided by various domestic and foreign third-party communication companies. Any disruption of these services could adversely affect our business. We have taken steps to mitigate our exposure to service disruptions by investing in complex and multi-layered redundancies focused on our customer experience center locations, and we can transition service delivery among our different customer experience centers around the world. Despite these efforts, and especially in light of the recent transition of a large portion of our delivery to a work from home environment where conventional redundancies strategies are ineffective, there can be no assurance that the redundancies we have in place would be sufficient to maintain operations without disruption.\nOur inability to obtain third-party communication and data services at favorable rates could negatively affect our results of operations. Where possible, we have entered into long-term contracts with various providers to mitigate short term rate increases and fluctuations. There is no obligation, however, for the vendors to renew their contracts with us, or to offer the same or lower rates in the future, and such contracts may be subject to termination or modification for various reasons outside of our control. A significant increase in the cost of third-party communication services that is not recoverable through an increase in the price of our services could adversely affect our business.\nThe current trend to outsource customer care may not continue and the prices that clients are willing to pay for the services may diminish, adversely affecting our business\nOur growth depends, in large part, on the willingness of our clients and potential clients to outsource customer care and management services to companies like TTEC. There can be no assurance that the customer care outsourcing trend will continue; and our clients and potential clients may elect to perform in-house customer care and management services that they currently outsource. Reduction in demand for our services and increased competition from other providers and in-house service alternatives could create pricing pressures and excess capacity that would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur profitability could suffer if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful\nOur ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our ability to engage in continuous management of our costs. Our cost management strategies include optimizing the alignment between the demand for our services and our resource capacity, including our customer experience centers\u2019 utilization; investment in our work from home environment; the costs of service delivery; the cost of sales and general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues; and the use of process automation for standard operating tasks. Our ongoing cost management measures must be balanced against the need for investment to support our growth, technology transformation in our business, and increasing cybersecurity threats. The cost management measures are also being impacted by inflationary pressures in the economies where we run our business. If we are not effective in managing our operating and administrative costs in response to changes in demand and pricing for our services, if we manage our costs at the expense of investments necessary to grow and protect our business, or if we are unable to absorb or pass on to our clients the increases in our costs of operations, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur profitability may be adversely affected if we are unable to expand and maintain service delivery in countries with stable wage rates and launch operations in new delivery locations required by our clients\nOur business is labor-intensive and therefore cost of wages, benefits, and related taxes constitute a large component of our operating expenses. As a result, our growth is dependent upon our ability to maintain and expand our operations in cost-effective locations, in and outside of the United States.\nOur clients often dictate locations from where they wish for us to serve their customers, such as \u201cnear shore\u201d jurisdictions located in close proximity to the U.S., to a headquarter location of the client, or in specific locations elsewhere in the world. There is no assurance that we will be able to effectively launch operations in jurisdictions which meet our cost-effectiveness, labor availability, and security standards.\nOur inability to expand our operations to such locations, however, may impact our ability to secure new clients and additional business from existing clients, and could adversely affect our growth and results of operations.\nIntellectual property infringement may adversely impact our ability to innovate and compete\nOur intellectual property may not always receive favorable treatment from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, or similar foreign intellectual property adjudication and registration agencies; and our \u201cpatent pending\u201d intellectual property may not receive a patent or may be subject to prior art limitations.\nThe lack of an effective legal system in certain countries where we do business or lack of commitment to protection of intellectual property rights, may prevent us from being able to defend our intellectual property and related technology against infringement by others, leading to a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs our reliance on advance technology for services that we provide increases, so is the risk of infringement or claims of infringement of intellectual property rights of others. If we are not successful in defending against such claims, our results of operations may be impacted.\nWe have incurred and may in the future incur impairments to goodwill, long-lived assets or strategic investments\nAs a result of past acquisitions, as of December 31, 2021, we have approximately $739.5 million of goodwill and $212.3 million of intangible assets included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We review our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least once annually, and more often when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We perform an assessment of qualitative and quantitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the goodwill or intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. In the event that the book value of goodwill or intangible asset is impaired, such impairment would be charged to earnings in the period when such impairment is determined. We have recorded goodwill and intangible impairments in the past, and there can be no assurance that we will not incur impairment charges in the future that could have material adverse effects on our financial condition or results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR TECHNOLOGY\nCyberattacks, cyber fraud, and unauthorized information disclosure could harm our reputation, and result in liability and service outages, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations\nOur business involves the use, storage, and transmission of information about our clients, their customers, and our employees. We also monitor and support information systems for certain clients through cloud-based and on-client-premises managed services model. While we believe that we take reasonable measures to protect the security of and unauthorized access to our systems and to our clients\u2019 systems, and the privacy of personal and proprietary information that we access and store, our security controls over our systems have not prevented and in the future may not prevent improper access to these systems or disclosure of information stored on these systems. Such unauthorized access or disclosure could subject TTEC to significant liability under relevant law or our contracts and could harm our reputation, resulting in impacts on our results of operations, loss of future revenue and business opportunities. These risks may further increase as our business model now includes higher percentage of work from home delivery, in addition to our traditional delivery through customer experience centers.\nIn recent years, there have been an increasing number of high-profile security breaches at companies and government agencies, and security experts have warned about the growing risks of hackers, cybercriminals and state actors launching a broad range of ransomware, data exfiltration, and other cyberattacks targeting information technology systems. Information security breaches, computer viruses, service interruption, loss of business data, DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks, ransomware and other cyberattacks on any of our systems or on our clients\u2019 systems that we manage have or in the future could disrupt the normal operations of our customer experience centers, our remote customer experience service delivery, our cloud platform digital offerings, our clients\u2019 on-premise managed service offerings, and our enterprise services, impeding our ability to provide critical services to our clients. Techniques used by cyber criminals to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade services, or sabotage systems evolve frequently and may not immediately be detected, and we may be unable to implement adequate preventative measures.\nFor example, on September 12, 2021, TTEC experienced a cybersecurity incident that involved our information systems. Certain TTEC systems and data became encrypted; and certain TTEC data was exfiltrated or destroyed. The incident resulted in a temporary disruption to the Engage business segment\u2019s client support environment TTEC restored and rebuilt many of the systems and data impacted in the incident. TTEC recovered exfiltrated data from the unauthorized parties, and while we currently have no reasons to believe that such data was publicly released, no assurance can be made that it was not released or that it may not be released in the future. We provided notices to those whose data was involved in the incident and are providing customary credit and other support to individuals involved. We also provided appropriate regulatory notices in connection with the incident. As a result of the incident, some clients reduced or terminated services we are providing to them, while some opted to temporarily suspend our access to their networks as a security precaution until they were satisfied that the incident was contained (see Part I, Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information regarding the security incident).\nAs another example, on July 2, 2021, our subsidiary Avtex Solutions, LLC (\u201cAvtex\u201d) and some of its clients experienced a ransomware attack as part of a global supply chain compromise that impacted thousands of companies worldwide and is believed to have been orchestrated by a Russian-based REvil cybercriminal group. The attack exploited a vulnerability in a Kaseya VSA remote monitoring software that Avtex utilized in its managed services solution (\u201cKaseya REvil attack\u201d). TTEC systems and TTEC\u2019s client support environments, outside of Avtex, were not impacted by the Kaseya REvil attack. TTEC recovered Avtex\u2019s operating environment and restored Avtex to full operating capacity by July 3, 2021, and supported its clients in their recovery\nWhile we believe that we have remediated the immediate consequences of these cybersecurity incidents, cybersecurity events may have cascading effects that unfold over time and result in additional costs, including costs associated with investigations, government enforcement actions, regulatory investigations, fines and penalties, contractual claims, performance penalties, litigation, financial judgement or settlements in excess of insurance, disputes with insurance carriers concerning coverage, loss of clients\u2019 trust, future business cancelations and other losses. Any perception by existing and prospective clients that our systems or the information system environments that we support for our clients are not secure could result in a material loss of business and revenue and damage our reputation and competitiveness.\nAs others in many industries, we are experiencing an increase in frequency of cybersecurity and cyber fraud attempts, including phishing attempts, and so-called \u201csocial engineering\u201d attacks, which typically seek unauthorized access into the environment, money transfers or unauthorized information disclosure. We actively train our employees to recognize these attacks and have implemented proactive risk mitigation measures to curb them. There are no assurances, however, that these attacks, which are growing in sophistication and frequency, may not deceive our employees, resulting in a material loss and impacts to our operations and back-office environments.\nWhile we believe we have taken reasonable measures to protect our systems and processes from unauthorized intrusions and cyber-fraud, we cannot be certain that advances in cyber-criminal capabilities, discovery of new system vulnerabilities, and attempts to exploit such vulnerabilities will not compromise or breach the technology protecting our systems and the information that we manage and control, which could result in damage to our systems, our reputation, and our profitability.\nIf our cloud platform experiences disruptions due to technology failures or cyberattacks and if we fail to correct such impacts promptly, our business will be materially impacted\nOur cloud platforms and third-party software and systems that we use to serve our clients are complex and may, from time to time have service interruptions, contain design defects, configuration or coding errors, and other vulnerabilities that may be difficult to detect or correct, and which may be outside of our control. Although our commercial agreements limit our exposure from such occurrences, they may not always effectively protect us against claims in all jurisdictions and against third-party claims. If our clients\u2019 business is damaged, our reputation could suffer, we could be subject to contract termination and payments for damages, adversely affecting our business, our reputation, our results of operations and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS\nWe face special risks associated with international operations\nAn important component of our business strategy is service delivery outside of the United States and our continuing international expansion. During 2021, we derived approximately 33% of our revenue from operations outside of the U.S. Conducting business abroad is subject to a variety of risks, including:\n\u2022 inconsistent regulations, licensing requirements, prescriptive labor rule, corrupt business practices, restrictive export control and immigration laws may result in inadvertent violation of laws that we may not be able to immediately detect or correct; and may increase our cost of operations as we endeavor to comply with laws that differ from one country to another;\n\u2022 uncertainty of tax regulations in countries where we do business may affect our costs of operation;\n\u2022 longer payment cycles could impact our cash flows and results of operations;\n\u2022 political and economic instability and unexpected changes in regulatory regimes could adversely affect our ability to deliver services overseas and our ability to repatriate cash;\n\u2022 the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (known as \u201cBrexit\u201d) added complexity and cost to provision of services and movement of people across UK, Ireland and continental members of the European Union, which could impact our European operations and our operations in the UK;\n\u2022 currency exchange rate fluctuations, restrictions on currency movement, and impact of international tax laws could adversely affect our results of operations, if we are forced to maintain assets in currencies other than U.S. dollars, while our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars;\n\u2022 infrastructure challenges and lack of sophisticated disaster and pandemic preparedness in some countries where we do business may impact our service delivery; and\n\u2022 terrorist attacks or civil unrest in some of the regions where we do business, and the resulting need for enhanced security measures may impact our ability to deliver services, threaten the safety of our employees, and increase our costs of operations.\nWhile we monitor and endeavor to mitigate in a timely manner the relevant regulatory, geopolitical, and other risks related to our operations outside of the United States, we cannot assess with certainty what impact such risks are likely to have over time on our business, and we can provide no assurance that we will always be able to mitigate these risks successfully and avoid adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur delivery model involves geographic concentration outside of the United States exposing us to significant operational risks\nOur customer engagement delivery and our back-office functions are concentrated in the Philippines, Mexico, India, and Bulgaria. Our business model is dependent on our ability to locate at least some of our customer engagement service delivery and enterprise support functions in low-cost jurisdictions around the globe. Our dependence on our customer engagement centers and enterprise support functions in the Philippines and Mexico, which are subject to frequent severe weather, natural disasters, health and security threats, and arbitrary government actions represents a particular risk. Natural disasters (floods, winds, and earthquakes), terrorist attacks, pandemics, large-scale utilities outages, telecommunication and transportation disruptions, labor or political unrest, and restriction on repatriation of funds at some of these locations may interrupt or limit our ability to operate or may increase our costs. Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans, while extensive, may not be effective, particularly if catastrophic events occur.\nFor these and other reasons, our geographic concentration in locations outside of the United States could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we procure business interruption insurance to cover some of these exposures, adequate insurance may not be available on an ongoing basis for a reasonable price.\nWe may face new risks as we expand our operations into countries where we have no prior experience\nAt times, our clients ask us to establish new operations quickly in countries where we previously have not done business. New market entry is fraught with operational, security, regulatory compliance, safety, and corruption risks, and these risks are exacerbated when new operations are launched quickly. TTEC has extensive experience in new market entry around the globe, but there can no assurances that new operations in new countries would not result in financial loses and operational instability. If we elect not to follow our clients to markets where they wish to have services, we may lose lucrative contracts, including contracts in multiple jurisdictions where we have experience, to competitors who are already established in the markets new to us, which would impact our financial results of operations.\nOur financial results may be adversely impacted by foreign currency exchange rate risk\nMany contracts that we service from customer engagement centers or employees working from home based outside of the United States are typically priced, invoiced, and paid in U.S. and Australian dollars, the British pound or Euros, while the costs incurred to deliver these services are incurred in the functional currencies of the country of operations. The fluctuations between the currencies of the contract and operating currencies present foreign currency exchange risks. Furthermore, because our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, but approximately 14% of our revenue is derived from contracts denominated in other currencies, our results of operations could be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.\nWhile we hedge at various levels against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully manage this foreign currency exchange risk and avoid adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO LEGAL, COMPLIANCE, REGULATORY MATTERS AND CONTRACTING PRACTICES\nOur results of operations may be impacted by changes in laws, our failure to comply with laws and regulations relevant to our business\nOur business is subject to extensive, and at times conflicting, regulations by the United States, state, local, foreign national, and provincial authorities relating to confidential client and customer data, data privacy, customer communications, telemarketing practices, licensed healthcare, financial services, collections, and gaming/gambling support activities, trade restrictions and sanctions, tariffs, import/export controls, taxation, labor regulations, wages and severance, health care requirements, disclosure obligations, and immigration among other areas.\nAs we provide services to clients\u2019 customers residing in countries where we do not have operations on the ground, we may also be subject to laws and regulations of these countries. Costs and complexity of compliance with existing and future regulations that could apply to our business may adversely affect our profitability; and if we fail to comply with these mandates, we could be subject to contractual, civil and criminal liability, monetary damages and fines. Enforcement actions by regulatory agencies could also materially increase our costs of operations and impact our ability to serve our clients.\nAdverse changes in laws or regulations that impact our business may negatively affect the sale of our services, slow the growth of our operations, or mandate changes to how we deliver our services, including our ability to use offshore resources. These changes could threaten our ability to continue to serve certain markets.\nUncertainty and inconsistency in privacy and data protection laws that impact our business, failure to comply with contractual obligations related to privacy, and high cost of compliance may impact our ability to deliver services and our results of operations\nDuring the last several years, there has been a significant increase in data protection and privacy regulations and enforcement activity in many jurisdictions where we and our clients do business. These new regulations are often complex and at times they impose conflicting requirements among different jurisdictions that we serve. For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes data protection requirements for controllers and processers of personally identifiable information collected in Europe, while the California Consumer Privacy Protection Act (CCPA), and other similar acts in Illinois, and New York, and Massachusetts in the United States imposed similar regulations protecting state residents with a different reach. Well-publicized security breaches have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures being taken by companies to protect against cyberattacks and may in the future result in heightened cybersecurity requirements, including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of vendors and service providers. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client and their customers data, whether through breach of our systems or otherwise, could expose us to costly litigation and cause us to lose clients. For example, the U.S. government may impose new federal data privacy and regulation mandates as part of Biden Administration agenda in 2022. Failure to comply with all privacy and data protection laws that are relevant to different parts of our business may result in legal claims, significant fines, sanctions, or penalties, or may make it difficult for us to secure business or efficiently serve our clients. Compliance with these evolving regulations may require significant investment which would impact our results of operations.\nWage and hour class action lawsuits targeting our business can expose us to costly litigation and damage our reputation\nThe contact center industry in the United States is a target of plaintiffs\u2019 law firms that specialize in wage and hour class action lawsuits against large employers by soliciting potential plaintiffs including current and former employees, with billboard and social media advertising. The plaintiff law firms seek large settlements based entirely on the number of potential plaintiffs in a class, whether or not there is any basis for the claims that they make on behalf of their clients, most of whom do not believe themselves to be aggrieved nor seek recourse until solicited. The cost of defending litigation for these large class action lawsuits has been and will continue to be significant. Because TTEC hires large numbers of employees in the United States and our industry has large turnover, the potential size of plaintiffs\u2019 classes in these wage and hour lawsuits can be considerable, creating a material impact on the cost of operations. As we continue to hire more employees in the United States, and expand our operations to California, where the number of wage and hour class action lawsuits is larger than in many other states combined and where verdicts in these lawsuits are very large, our results of operations may be material impacted by these lawsuits.\nLegislation discouraging offshoring of service by United States companies or making such offshoring difficult could significantly affect our business\nA perceived association between offshore service providers and the loss of jobs in the United States has been a focus of political debate in recent years. As a result, current and prospective clients may be reluctant to hire offshore service providers like TTEC to avoid negative perceptions and regulatory scrutiny. If they seek customer care and management capacity onshore that was previously available to them through outsourcers outside of the United States, they may elect to perform these services in-house instead of outsourcing the services onshore. Possible tax incentives for U.S. businesses to return offshored services to the United States could also impact our clients\u2019 continuing interest in using our services.\nLegislation aimed to expand protections for U.S. and European based customers from having their personal data accessible outside of their home jurisdictions, could also impact offshored outsourcing opportunities by requiring notice and consent as a condition for sharing personal identifiable information with foreign service delivery personnel. Further, the U.S. government\u2019s reputation for use of individuals\u2019 personal information for national security purposes without individuals\u2019 consent, caused restrictions on transfer to the United States for processing of customers and customers\u2019 data in several countries (e.g., Canada). Any material changes in current trends among our clients to use services outsourced and delivered offshore or to transfer information outside of the home country for processing would materially impact our business and results of operations.\nIncreases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in income tax rates or other changes in income tax laws in any particular jurisdiction could reduce our after-tax income from such jurisdictions and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our operations outside the U.S. generate a significant portion of our income and many of the other countries in which we have significant operations, have recently made or are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings.\nThe Biden administration has called for changes to fiscal and tax policies, which may include comprehensive tax reform. Many of these proposed and enacted changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our effective tax rate or adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThere are no assurances that we will be able to implement effective tax planning strategies that are necessary to optimize our tax position following changes in tax laws globally. If we are unable to implement a cost-effective contracting structure, our effective tax rate and our results of operations would be impacted.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses or federal tax credits to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIf the transfer pricing arrangements we have among our subsidiaries are determined to be inappropriate, our tax liability may increase\nWe have transfer pricing arrangements among our subsidiaries in relation to various aspects of our business, including operations, marketing, sales, and delivery functions. The United States, Australia, Mexico, India, Philippines and other transfer pricing regulations in other countries where we operate, require that cross-border transactions between affiliates be on arm\u2019s-length terms. We carefully consider the pricing among our subsidiaries to assure that they are at arm\u2019s-length. If tax authorities were to determine that the transfer prices and terms we have applied are not appropriate, we may incur increased tax liability, including accrued interest and penalties, which would cause material increase in our tax liability, thereby impacting our profitability and cash flows, and potentially resulting in a material adverse effect on our operations, effective tax rate and financial condition.\nContract terms typical in our industry can lead to volatility in our revenue and in our margins\nMany of our TTEC Engage contracts require clients to provide monthly forecasts of volumes, but no guaranteed or minimum volume or revenue levels. Such forecasts vary from month to month, which can impact our staff and space utilizations, our cost structure, and our profitability.\nMany of our contracts have termination for convenience clauses with short notice periods and no guarantees of minimum revenue levels or profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation. If a client terminates a contract or materially reduces customer interaction volumes, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and makes it harder to make projections.\nWe may not always offset increased costs with increased fees under long-term contracts. The pricing and other terms of our client contracts, particularly on our long-term service agreements, are based on estimates and assumptions we make at contact inception. These estimates reflect our best judgments regarding the nature of the engagement and our expected costs to provide the contracted services, but these judgments could differ from actual results, especially as economies where we do business go through post-COVID-19 pandemic adjustments and inflationary pressures. Not all our contracts allow for escalation of fees as our cost of operations increase. Moreover, those that do allow for such escalations do not always allow increases at rates comparable to increases that we experience due to rising minimum wage costs, related payroll cost increases, and increased costs of work from home environment, not offset by reduction in physical footprint due to long term lease commitments. If and to the extent we do not negotiate long-term contract terms that provide for fee adjustments to reflect increases in our cost-of-service delivery, our business, financial conditions, and results of operation could be materially impacted.\nWe provide service level commitments to certain customers. If we do not meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits or refunds or face contract terminations, which could adversely affect our revenue and harm our reputation.\nOur pricing depends on effectiveness of our level of effort forecasts. Pricing of our services in our digital business is contingent on our ability to accurately forecast the level of effort and cost necessary to deliver our services, which is data dependent and can be inaccurate. The errors in level of effort estimations could yield lower profit margins or cause projects to become unprofitable, resulting in adverse impacts on our results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nExclusive forum for dispute resolution provisions in our bylaws could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for their disputes\nOur bylaws designate Delaware\u2019s state courts as the exclusive forum for most disputes between us and our stockholders, including federal claims and derivative actions. We believe that this provision may benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law and federal securities laws by chancellors and judges who are particularly experienced in resolving corporate disputes, efficient administration of cases relative to other forums, and protection against the burdens of multi-forum litigation. This choice of forum provision does not have the effect of causing our stockholders to waive our obligation to comply with the federal securities laws. This bylaw forum selection provision is not uncommon for companies incorporated in the State of Delaware, but it could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to select a more favorable judicial forum for disputes with us, our directors, officers or other employees and may therefore discourage litigation. It is important to note, however, that our choice of forum provision would (i) not be enforceable with respect to any suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and (ii) have uncertain enforceability with respect to claims under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nDelaware law and certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the price of our common stock\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions, among other things:\n\u2022 authorize the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n\u2022 provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by our Chairman, President or our board of directors;\n\u2022 establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings;\n\u2022 permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors; and\n\u2022 provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock. Further, as described below, a majority of our stock is held by a single controlling stockholder, which means that a change in control of our company or the composition of the Board of Directors will not occur without the approval of the controlling stockholder.\nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer controls a majority of our stock and has control over all matters requiring action by our stockholders; and his interest may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders\nKenneth D. Tuchman, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, directly and beneficially owns approximately 59% of TTEC\u2019s common stock. As a result, Mr. Tuchman could and does exercise significant influence and control over our business practices and strategy. As long as Mr. Tuchman continues to beneficially own more than 50% of our common stock he will be able to elect all of the members of our Board of Directors, effect stockholder actions by written consent in lieu of stockholder meetings, and determine the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, including matters involving mergers or other business combinations, the acquisition or disposition of assets, the occurrence of indebtedness, the issuance of any additional shares of common stock or other equity securities and the payment of dividends on our common stock.\nThe interest of Mr. Tuchman may not always coincide with the interest of our other stockholders, and Mr. Tuchman may seek to cause the company to take actions that might involve risks to our business or adversely affect us or our other stockholders. For example, Mr. Tuchman\u2019s control of TTEC could delay or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely, Mr. Tuchman\u2019s control could result in the consummation of a transaction that our other stockholders do not support. As a controlling stockholder, Mr. Tuchman is generally entitled to vote his shares as he sees fit, which may not always be in the interest of our other stockholders. This concentrated control could also discourage parties from acquiring our common stock or initiating potential mergers, takeovers or other change of control transactions, which could depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur status as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price\nBecause we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the listing rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market, we are not required to have a majority of our Board of Directors be independent, nor are we required to have an independent compensation committee or an independent nominating committee of the Board. While the Company has elected not to avail itself of these governance exceptions available to \u201ccontrolled companies,\u201d in the future the Company may elect to do so. Accordingly, because of our \u201ccontrolled company\u201d status, the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for NASDAQ-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.", "PERMNO": 83916, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "TTEC"}
