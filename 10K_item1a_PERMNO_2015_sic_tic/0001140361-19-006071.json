{"cik": "1746129", "company": "Bank7 Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe believe the risks described below are the risks that are material to us. Any of the following risks, as well as risks that we do not know or currently deem immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Market\nWe may not be able to implement aspects of our expansion strategy, which may adversely affect our ability to maintain our historical earnings trends.\nWe may not be able to sustain our growth at the rate we have enjoyed during the past several years. Our growth over the past several years has been driven primarily by a strong commercial lending market in our market areas and our ability to identify attractive expansion opportunities. A downturn in local economic market conditions, a failure to attract and retain high performing personnel, heightened competition from other financial services providers and an inability to attract additional core deposits and lending customers, among other factors, could limit our ability to grow as rapidly as we have in the past and as such may have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, risks associated with failing to maintain effective financial and operational controls as we grow, such as maintaining appropriate loan underwriting procedures, determining an adequate allowance and complying with regulatory accounting requirements, including increased loan losses, reduced earnings and potential regulatory penalties and restrictions on growth, all could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to manage the risks associated with our anticipated growth and expansion through de novo branching.\nOur business strategy includes evaluating potential strategic opportunities to grow through de novo branching. De novo branching carries with it certain potential risks, including significant startup costs; anticipated initial operating losses; inability to gain regulatory approval; inability to secure the services of qualified senior management to operate the de novo banking location and successfully integrate and promote our corporate culture; poor market reception for de novo banking locations established in markets where we do not have a preexisting reputation; challenges posed by local economic conditions; challenges associated with securing attractive locations at a reasonable cost; and the additional strain on management resources and internal systems and controls. Failure to adequately manage the risks associated with our anticipated growth through de novo branching could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may grow through mergers or acquisitions, which strategy may not be successful or, if successful, may produce risks in successfully integrating and managing the merged companies or acquisition targets and may dilute our shareholders.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may pursue mergers and acquisitions of banks and nonbank financial services companies within or outside our principal market areas. Although we regularly identify and explore specific acquisition opportunities as part of our ongoing business practices, we have no present agreements or commitments to merge with or acquire any financial institution or any other company, and may not find suitable merger or acquisition opportunities. We face significant competition from numerous other financial services institutions, many of which will have greater financial resources or more liquid securities than we do, when considering acquisition opportunities. Accordingly, attractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or completing any future acquisitions.\nMergers and acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including:\n\u2022 difficulties in integrating the operations, management, products and services, technologies, existing contracts, accounting processes and personnel of the target and realizing the anticipated synergies of the combined businesses;\n\u2022 difficulties in supporting and transitioning customers of the target;\n\u2022 diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;\n\u2022 assumption of nonperforming loans;\n\u2022 the price we pay or other resources that we devote may exceed the value we realize, or the value we could have realized if we had allocated the purchase price or other resources to another opportunity;\n\u2022 entering new markets or areas in which we have limited or no experience;\n\u2022 potential loss of key personnel and customers from either our business or the target\u2019s business;\n\u2022 assumption of unanticipated problems or latent liabilities of the target; and\n\u2022 inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs.\nMergers and acquisitions also frequently result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, which are subject to potential impairments in the future and that could harm our financial results. In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities, our existing shareholders may be diluted, which could affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate mergers, acquisitions or investments, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such merger or acquisition, and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate. The failure to successfully evaluate and execute mergers, acquisitions or investments or otherwise adequately address these risks could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may implement or may acquire new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. We may not achieve target timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and new products or services and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as regulatory compliance obligations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is concentrated in, and largely dependent upon, the continued growth and welfare of our markets, and adverse economic conditions in these markets could negatively impact our operations and customers.\nOur business is affected by the economy of Oklahoma, the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area and Kansas, our primary markets. Our success depends to a significant extent upon the business activity, population, income levels, employment trends, deposits and real estate activity in these markets. The Oklahoma economy has been generally steady, if not increasing, in the past few years. The housing market remains strong with prices having increased through 2018. Vacancy rates for commercial properties remain low and small business owners are increasingly considering bank borrowings in order to grow.\nIn addition, market developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could impact our charge-offs and provision for credit losses. Adverse changes in economic conditions in these markets could reduce our growth in loans and deposits, impair our ability to collect our loans, increase our problem loans and charge-offs and otherwise negatively affect our performance and financial condition.\nA decline in general business and economic conditions and any regulatory responses to such conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur business and operations, which primarily consist of lending money to customers in the form of loans and borrowing money from customers in the form of deposits, are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States, generally, and particularly the States of Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. If the U.S. economy weakens, our growth and profitability from our lending, deposit and investment operations could be constrained. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions could lead to credit quality concerns related to borrower repayment ability and collateral protection as well as reduced demand for the products and services we offer. In recent years, there has been a gradual improvement in the U.S. economy and the economies of the states in which we operate, as evidenced by a rebound in the housing market, lower unemployment and higher valuations in the equities markets; however, economic growth has been uneven, and opinions vary on the strength and direction of the economy. Uncertainties also have arisen regarding the potential for a reversal or renegotiation of international trade agreements and the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017, and the impact such actions and other policies of the administration of President Donald Trump may have on economic and market conditions. In addition, concerns about the performance of international economies can impact the economy and financial markets here in the United States. If the national, regional and local economies experience worsening economic conditions, including high levels of unemployment, our growth and profitability could be constrained. Weak economic conditions are characterized by, among other indicators, deflation, elevated levels of unemployment, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, increased delinquencies on commercial, mortgage and consumer loans, residential and CRE price declines and lower home sales and commercial activity. All of these factors are generally detrimental to our business. Our business is significantly affected by monetary and other regulatory policies of the U.S. federal government, its agencies and government-sponsored entities. Changes in any of these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond our control, are difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe have credit exposure to the energy industry.\nThe energy industry is a significant sector in our Oklahoma market, and to a lesser extent, Kansas and the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area. A downturn or lack of growth in the energy industry and energy-related business, including sustained low oil or gas prices or the failure of oil or gas prices to rise in the future, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2018, our energy loans, which include loans to exploration and production companies, midstream companies, purchasers of mineral and royalty interests and service providers totaled $110.0 million, or 18.4% of total loans, as compared to $104.7 million, or 18.6% of total loans as of December 31, 2017 and $60.7 million, or 12.1% of total loans, as of December 31, 2016. In addition to our direct exposure to energy loans, we also have indirect exposure to energy prices, as some of our non-energy customers\u2019 businesses are directly affected by volatility with the oil and gas industry and energy prices and otherwise are dependent on energy-related businesses. As of December 31, 2018, we had $133.4 million in loan commitments, of which $23.4 million was unfunded debt, to borrowers in the oil and gas industry. Prolonged or further pricing pressure on oil and gas could lead to increased credit stress in our energy portfolio, increased losses associated with our energy portfolio, increased utilization of our contractual obligations to extend credit and weaker demand for energy lending. Such a decline or general uncertainty resulting from continued volatility could have other adverse impacts, such as job losses in industries tied to energy, increased spending habits, lower borrowing needs, higher transaction deposit balances or a number of other effects that are difficult to isolate or quantify, particularly in markets with significant dependence on the energy industry like Oklahoma, and to a lesser extent Kansas and the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have credit exposure to the hospitality industry.\nThe Company has loan exposure to the hospitality industry, primarily through loans made to construct or finance the operation of hotels. At December 31, 2018, this exposure was approximately $123 million, or 20.5%, of the total loan portfolio, along with an additional $28.3 million in unfunded debt. The hospitality industry is subject to changes in the travel patterns of business and leisure travelers, both of which are affected by the strength of the economy, as well as other factors. The performance of the hospitality industry has traditionally been closely linked with the performance of the general economy and, specifically, growth in gross domestic product. Changes in travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers, particularly during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth, may create difficulties for the industry over the long-term. Although we have made a large portion of our hospitality loans to long-term, well-established hotel operators in strategic locations, a general downturn in the supply growth of such markets or hotel occupancy or room rates could negatively impact the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay. A significant loss in this portfolio could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a concentration in commercial real estate lending that could cause our regulators to restrict our ability to grow.\nAs a part of their regulatory oversight, the federal regulators have issued guidance on Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices, or the CRE Concentration Guidance, with respect to a financial institution\u2019s concentrations in CRE lending activities. This guidance was issued in response to the agencies\u2019 concerns that rising CRE concentrations might expose institutions to unanticipated earnings and capital volatility in the event of adverse changes in the CRE market. This guidance reinforces and enhances existing regulations and guidelines for safe and sound real estate lending by providing supervisory criteria, including numerical indicators to assist in identifying institutions with potentially significant CRE loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny. The guidance does not limit banks\u2019 CRE lending, but rather guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their CRE concentrations. The CRE Concentration Guidance identifies certain concentration levels that, if exceeded, will expose the institution to additional supervisory analysis with regard to the institution\u2019s CRE concentration risk. The CRE Concentration Guidance is designed to promote appropriate levels of capital and sound loan and risk management practices for institutions with a concentration of CRE loans. In general, the CRE Concentration Guidance establishes the following supervisory criteria as preliminary indications of possible CRE concentration risk: (1) the institution\u2019s total construction, land development and other land loans represent 100% or more of total capital; or (2) total CRE loans as defined in this guidance, or Regulatory CRE, represent 300% or more of total capital, and the institution\u2019s Regulatory CRE has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36-month period. Pursuant to the CRE Concentration Guidance, loans secured by owner occupied CRE are not included for purposes of the CRE concentration calculation. We believe that the CRE Concentration Guidance is applicable to us. As of December 31, 2018, our Regulatory CRE represented 263.8% of our total Bank capital and our construction, land development and other land loans represented 93.1% of our total Bank capital, as compared to 256.5% and 130.0% as of December 31, 2017, respectively. During the prior 36-month period, our Regulatory CRE has increased 114.2%. We are actively working to manage our Regulatory CRE concentration, and we believe that our underwriting policies, management information systems, independent credit administration process, and monitoring of real estate loan concentrations are currently sufficient to address the CRE Concentration Guidance. We have implemented enhanced CRE monitoring techniques as expected by banking regulators as our concentrations have approached or exceeded the regulatory guidance. Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve could become concerned about our CRE loan concentrations, and it could limit our ability to grow by restricting its approvals for the establishment or acquisition of branches, or approvals of mergers or other acquisition opportunities, or by requiring us to raise additional capital, reduce our loan concentrations or undertake other remedial actions.\nBecause a portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans, negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity could impair the value of collateral securing our real estate loans and result in loan and other losses.\nAdverse developments affecting real estate values, particularly in Oklahoma City and the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area, could increase the credit risk associated with our real estate loan portfolio. Real estate values may experience periods of fluctuation, and the market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time. Adverse changes affecting real estate values and the liquidity of real estate in one or more of our markets could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio, and could result in losses that adversely affect credit quality, financial condition and results of operation. Negative changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity in our market areas could significantly impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans and affect our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses. Collateral may have to be sold for less than the outstanding balance of the loan, which could result in losses on such loans. Such declines and losses could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and growth prospects. If real estate values decline, it is also more likely that we would be required to increase our allowance, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our loans are to commercial borrowers, which have a higher degree of risk than other types of loans.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $588.2 million of commercial purpose loans, which include general commercial, energy, agricultural, and CRE loans, representing approximately 97.7% of our gross loan portfolio. Commercial purpose loans are often larger and involve greater risks than other types of lending. Because payments on these loans are often dependent on the successful operation or development of the property or business involved, their repayment is more sensitive than other types of loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the general economy.\nAccordingly, a downturn in the real estate market or the general economy could heighten our risk related to commercial purpose loans, particularly energy and CRE loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrowers\u2019 ability to make repayment from their employment and other income and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial purpose loans typically are made on the basis of the borrowers\u2019 ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the commercial venture. If the cash flow from business operations is reduced, the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay the loan may be impaired. As a result of the larger average size of each commercial purpose loan as compared with other loans such as residential loans, as well as the collateral which is generally less readily marketable, losses incurred on a small number of commercial purpose loans could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur largest loan relationships make up a material percentage of our total loan portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our 20 largest borrowing relationships ranged from approximately $8.7 million to $25 million (including unfunded commitments) and totaled approximately $263.8 million in total commitments (representing, in the aggregate, 35.8% of our total outstanding commitments as of December 31, 2018). Of these 20 relationships, $174.8 million were originated from the Oklahoma market, with the remaining $89.0 million extended to borrowers located in the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area. Each of the loans associated with these relationships has been underwritten in accordance with our underwriting policies and limits. Along with other risks inherent in these loans, such as the deterioration of the underlying businesses or property securing these loans, this concentration of borrowers presents a risk that, if one or more of these relationships were to become delinquent or suffer default, we could be exposed to material losses. The allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover losses associated with any of these relationships, and any loss or increase in the allowance would negatively affect our earnings and capital. Even if these loans are adequately collateralized, an increase in classified assets could harm our reputation with our regulators and inhibit our ability to execute our business plan.\nOur largest deposit relationships currently make up a material percentage of our deposits and the withdrawal of deposits by our largest depositors could force us to fund our business through more expensive and less stable sources.\nAt December 31, 2018, our 20 largest deposit relationships accounted for 25.2% of our total deposits. Withdrawals of deposits by any one of our largest depositors or by one of our related customer groups could force us to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding for our business and withdrawal demands, adversely affecting our net interest margin and results of operations. We may also be forced, as a result of withdrawals of deposits, to rely more heavily on other, potentially more expensive and less stable funding sources. Additionally, such circumstances could require us to raise deposit rates in an attempt to attract new deposits, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Under applicable regulations, if the Bank were no longer \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d the Bank would not be able to accept brokered deposits without the approval of the FDIC.\nA substantial portion of our loan portfolio consists of loans maturing within one year, and there is no guarantee that these loans will be replaced upon maturity or renewed on the same terms or at all.\nAs of December 31, 2018, approximately 45.3% of our gross loans were maturing within one year, compared to approximately 49.6% of our gross loans that were maturing within one year as of December 31, 2017. As a result, we will either need to renew or replace these loans during the course of the year. There is no guarantee that these loans will be originated or renewed by borrowers on the same terms or at all, as demand for such loans may decrease. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that borrowers will qualify for new loans or that existing loans will be renewed by us on the same terms or at all, as collateral values may be insufficient or the borrowers\u2019 cash flow may be materially less than when the loan was initially originated. This could result in a significant decline in the size of our loan portfolio.\nOur controlling shareholders, the Haines Family Trusts, may transfer shares to certain of our executive officers, which may result in significant compensation expense to the Company and materially adversely affect our net income in the period in which it takes place.\nAs disclosed in the Prospectus filed with the SEC on September, 17, 2018, the Haines Family Trusts may transfer up to 6.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock to one or more of our executive officers. The Haines Family Trusts are currently evaluating such a transfer. There is no agreement that requires such transfers and there can be no assurance that such transfers will occur or the timing of any such transfers. Any shares transferred by the Haines Family Trusts to our employees may constitute share-based payments for purposes of ASC 718, which requires all share-based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values, and may constitute a taxable event for those employees. We expect to recognize compensation expense, which is a non-cash expense, if such transfers occur and the amount of such expense could materially reduce our GAAP net income. Based on 10,187,500 shares of our common stock outstanding and the year-end closing price of our common stock of $13.35 per share, the maximum compensation expense would be approximately $8.8 million. Such compensation expense would significantly reduce our net income in the period in which it takes place, which may result in a drop in our stock price. The potential transfers would not increase our outstanding shares of common stock, and we do not expect any such transfers to affect our equity capital position.\nWe could suffer material credit losses if we do not appropriately manage our credit risk.\nThere are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, risks of non-payment, risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral and risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions. Changes in the economy can cause the assumptions that we made at origination to change and can cause borrowers to be unable to make payments on their loans, and significant changes in collateral values can cause us to be unable to collect the full value of loans we make. There is no assurance that our loan approval and credit risk monitoring procedures are or will be adequate or will reduce the inherent risks associated with lending. Our credit administration personnel and our policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting customers and the quality of our loan portfolio. Any failure to manage such credit risks may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur levels of nonperforming assets could increase, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and could result in losses in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our nonperforming assets (which consist of nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest, other real estate owned and loans modified under troubled debt restructurings that are not performing in accordance with their modified terms) totaled $2,725,000. However, we can give no assurance that our nonperforming assets will continue to remain at low levels and we may experience increases in nonperforming assets in the future. Our nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting our net interest income, net income and returns on assets and equity, and our loan administration costs increase, which together with reduced interest income adversely affects our efficiency ratio. When we take collateral in foreclosure and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the collateral to its then-fair market value, which may result in a loss. These nonperforming assets also increase our risk profile and the level of capital our regulators believe is appropriate for us to maintain in light of such risks. The resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant time commitments from management and can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. If we were to experience increases in nonperforming assets, our net interest income may be negatively impacted and our loan administration costs could increase, each of which would have an adverse effect on our net income and related ratios, such as returns on assets and equity.\nOur allowance may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses.\nA significant source of risk arises from the possibility that we could sustain losses due to loan defaults and nonperformance on loans. We maintain an allowance in accordance with GAAP to provide for such defaults and other nonperformance. As of December 31, 2018, our allowance as a percentage of total loans was 1.31%. The determination of the appropriate level of allowance is an inherently difficult process and is based on numerous assumptions. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, our underwriting policies, adherence to credit monitoring processes and risk management systems and controls may not prevent unexpected losses. Our allowance may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses. Moreover, any increase in our allowance will adversely affect our earnings.\nIn the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the FASB decided to review how banks estimate losses in the allowance calculation, and it issued the final current expected credit loss standard, or CECL, in June 2016. Currently, the impairment model is based on incurred losses, and investments are recognized as impaired when there is no longer an assumption that future cash flows will be collected in full under the originally contracted terms. This model will be replaced by the new CECL model that will become effective for us, as an emerging growth company, for the first interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021. Under the new CECL model, financial institutions will be required to use historical information, current conditions and reasonable forecasts to estimate the expected loss over the life of the loan. The transition to the CECL model will bring with it significantly greater data requirements and changes to methodologies to accurately account for expected losses under the new parameters.\nManagement is currently evaluating the impact of these changes to our financial position and results of operations. The allowance is a material estimate of ours, and given the change from an incurred loss model to a methodology that considers the credit loss over the life of the loan, there is the potential for an increase in the allowance at adoption date. We anticipate a significant change in the processes and procedures to calculate the allowance, including changes in assumptions and estimates to consider expected credit losses over the life of the loan versus the current accounting practice that utilizes the incurred loss model. We expect to continue developing and implementing processes and procedures to ensure we are fully compliant with the CECL requirements at its adoption date.\nThe small- to medium-sized businesses that we lend to may have fewer resources to weather adverse business conditions, which may impair their ability to repay a loan, and such impairment could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business development and marketing strategies primarily result in us serving the banking and financial services needs of small- to medium-sized businesses. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities, frequently have smaller market shares than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small- to medium-sized business often depends on the management skills, talents and efforts of one or two people or a small group of people, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay its loans. If general economic conditions negatively impact Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas or the specific markets in these states in which we operate and small- to medium-sized businesses are adversely affected or our borrowers are otherwise affected by adverse business conditions, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on our senior management team and may have difficulty identifying, attracting and retaining necessary personnel, which may divert resources and limit our ability to execute our business strategy and successfully expand our operations.\nOur business plan includes, and is dependent upon, our hiring and retaining highly qualified and motivated personnel at every level. Our senior management team has significant industry experience, and their knowledge and relationships would be difficult to replace. The loss of senior management without qualified successors who can execute our strategy could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, since joining the Bank in August 2015, one senior loan officer in the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area, has originated 24.5% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018. The senior loan officer is subject to a noncompetition agreement but the loss of his expertise and ability, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition for senior executives and skilled personnel in the financial services and banking industry is intense, which means the cost of hiring, incenting and retaining skilled personnel may continue to increase. We need to continue to identify, attract and retain key personnel and to recruit qualified individuals to succeed existing key personnel to ensure the continued growth and successful operation of our business. In addition, as a provider of relationship-based commercial banking services, we must identify, attract and retain qualified banking personnel to continue to grow our business. Our ability to effectively compete for senior executives and other qualified personnel by offering competitive compensation and benefit arrangements may be restricted by applicable banking laws and regulations. If we are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel we may be unable to successfully execute our business strategy and manage our growth. In addition, to attract and retain personnel with appropriate skills and knowledge to support our business, we may offer a variety of benefits, which could reduce our earnings or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur profitability depends on interest rates generally, and we may be adversely affected by changes in market interest rates.\nOur profitability depends in substantial part on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the amounts received by us on our interest-earning assets and the interest paid by us on our interest-bearing liabilities. Our net interest income depends on many factors that are partly or completely outside of our control, including competition, federal economic, monetary and fiscal policies and economic conditions generally. Our net interest income will be adversely affected if market interest rates change so that the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest we earn on loans and investments.\nChanges in interest rates could affect our ability to originate loans and deposits. Historically, there has been an inverse correlation between the demand for loans and interest rates. Loan origination volume usually declines during periods of rising or high interest rates and increases during periods of declining or low interest rates. Changes in interest rates also have a significant impact on the carrying value of certain of our assets, including loans and other assets, on our balance sheet.\nInterest rate increases often result in larger payment requirements for our borrowers, which increase the potential for default. At the same time, the marketability of any underlying property that serves as collateral for such loans may be adversely affected by any reduced demand resulting from higher interest rates. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans may lead to an increase in nonperforming assets and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Further, when we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. Subsequently, we continue to have a cost to fund the loan, which is reflected as interest expense, without any interest income to offset the associated funding expense. Thus, an increase in the amount of nonaccrual loans would have an adverse impact on net interest income.\nIf short-term interest rates remain at low levels for a prolonged period, and if longer term interest rates fall, we could experience net interest margin compression as our interest-earning assets would continue to reprice downward while our interest-bearing liability rates could fail to decline in tandem. This could have a material adverse effect on our net interest income and our results of operations.\nThe ratio of variable- to fixed-rate loans in our loan portfolio, the ratio of short-term (maturing at a given time within 12 months) to long-term loans, and the ratio of our demand, money market and savings deposits to certificates of deposit (and their time periods), are the primary factors affecting the sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. The composition of our rate-sensitive assets or liabilities is subject to change and could result in a more unbalanced position that would cause market rate changes to have a greater impact on our earnings. Fluctuations in market rates and other market disruptions are neither predictable nor controllable and may adversely affect our financial condition and earnings.\nWe rely on short-term funding, which can be adversely affected by local and general economic conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2018, approximately $480.8 million, or 71.1%, of our deposits consisted of demand, savings, money market and negotiable order of withdrawal, or NOW, accounts. The approximately $195.2 million remaining balance of deposits consists of certificates of deposit, of which approximately $167.7 million, or 24.8% of our total deposits, was due to mature within one year. Based on our experience, we believe that our savings, money market and non-interest-bearing accounts are relatively stable sources of funds. Historically, a majority of non-brokered certificates of deposit are renewed upon maturity as long as we pay competitive interest rates. Many of these customers are, however, interest-rate conscious and may be willing to move funds into higher-yielding investment alternatives. Our ability to attract and maintain deposits, as well as our cost of funds, has been, and will continue to be significantly affected by general economic conditions. In addition, as market interest rates rise, we will have competitive pressure to increase the rates we pay on deposits. If we increase interest rates paid to retain deposits, our earnings may be adversely affected.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due and could jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. Liquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding. The Bank\u2019s primary funding source is customer deposits. In addition, the Bank has historically had access to advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Topeka, or the FHLB, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, or the FRB, discount window and other wholesale sources, such as internet-sourced deposits to fund operations. We participate in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service, or CDARS, where customer funds are placed into multiple certificates of deposit, each in an amount under the standard FDIC insurance maximum of $250,000, and placed at a network of banks across the United States. Although the Bank has historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary, it might not be able to replace such funds in the future. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on liquidity.\nOur access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on acceptable terms could be impaired by factors that affect our organization specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory actions against us. The Bank\u2019s ability to borrow or attract and retain deposits in the future could be adversely affected by the Bank\u2019s financial condition or regulatory restrictions, or impaired by factors that are not specific to it, such as FDIC insurance changes, disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the banking industry. Borrowing capacity from the FHLB or FRB may fluctuate based upon the condition of the Bank or the acceptability and risk rating of loan collateral and counterparties could adjust discount rates applied to such collateral at the lender\u2019s discretion.\nThe FRB or FHLB could restrict or limit the Bank\u2019s access to secured borrowings. Correspondent banks can withdraw unsecured lines of credit or require collateralization for the purchase of fed funds. Liquidity also may be affected by the Bank\u2019s routine commitments to extend credit. Market conditions or other events could also negatively affect the level or cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences.\nAny substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due and could jeopardize our financial condition.\nOur historical growth rate and performance may not be indicative of our future growth or financial results.\nWe may not be able to sustain our historical rate of growth or grow our business at all. We have benefited from the recent low interest rate environment, which has provided us with high net interest margins which we use to grow our business. Higher rates may compress our margins and may impact our ability to grow. Additionally, we may not be able to maintain the historically low level of expenses. As a public company, we expect that we will incur additional expenses, commit significant resources, hire additional staff and provide additional management oversight for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public companies. Sustaining our growth also will require us to commit additional management, operational and financial resources to identify new professionals to join our company and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support expansion. Consequently, our historical results of operations will not necessarily be indicative of our future operations.\nWe face strong competition from banks, credit unions and other financial services providers that offer banking services, which may limit our ability to attract and retain banking customers.\nCompetition in the banking industry generally, and in our primary markets specifically, is intense. Competitors include banks as well as other financial services providers, such as savings and loan institutions, consumer finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries. In particular, our competitors include several larger national and regional financial institutions whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and ATMs, achieve larger economies of scale, offer a wider array of banking services, make larger investments in technologies needed to attract and retain customers and conduct extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. If we are unable to offer competitive products and services as quickly as our larger competitors, our business may be negatively affected. Additionally, as a smaller institution, we are disproportionately affected by the continually increasing costs of compliance with new banking and other regulations. Banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve the credit needs of a broader customer base than us. Larger competitors may also be able to offer better lending and deposit rates to customers, and could increase their competition as we become a public company and our growth becomes more visible. If our competitors extend credit on terms we find to pose excessive risks, or at interest rates which we believe do not warrant the credit exposure, we may not be able to maintain our business volume and could experience deteriorating financial performance. Moreover, larger competitors may not be as vulnerable as us to downturns in the local economy and real estate markets since they often have a broader geographic area and their loan portfolio is often more diversified.\nAdditionally, we face growing competition from so-called \u201conline businesses\u201d with few or no physical locations, including financial technology companies, online banks, lenders and consumer and commercial lending platforms, as well as automated retirement and investment service providers. New technology and other changes are allowing parties to effectuate financial transactions that previously required the involvement of banks. For example, consumers can maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and access to lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe also compete against community banks, credit unions and non-bank financial services companies that have strong local ties. These smaller institutions are likely to cater to the same small- to medium-sized businesses that we target. If we are unable to attract and retain banking customers, we may be unable to continue to grow our loan and deposit portfolios and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Ultimately, we may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks or losses to us.\nOur risk management framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit, market, liquidity, interest rate, operational, reputation, business and compliance. Our framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. Our risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances and may not adequately mitigate risk or loss to us. If our risk management framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business, financial condition, results of operations or growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. We may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences.\nThe accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures could be affected if the judgments, assumptions or estimates used in our critical accounting policies are inaccurate.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our critical accounting policies, which are included in the section captioned \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in this report, describe those significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that we consider \u201ccritical\u201d because they require judgments, assumptions and estimates that materially affect our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. As a result, if future events or regulatory views concerning such analysis differ significantly from the judgments, assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies, those events or assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, in each case resulting in our need to revise or restate prior period financial statements, cause damage to our reputation and the price of our common stock and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately and timely, in which case our business may be harmed, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, we could be subject to regulatory penalties and the price of our common stock may decline.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for evaluating and reporting on that system of internal control. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. As a public company, we will be required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other rules that govern public companies. In particular, we will be required to certify our compliance with Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act beginning with our second annual report on Form 10-K, which will require us to furnish annually a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, unless we remain an emerging growth company and elect additional transitional relief available to emerging growth companies, our independent registered public accounting firm may be required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting beginning as of that second annual report on Form 10-K.\nWe will continue to periodically test and update, as necessary, our internal control systems, including our financial reporting controls. Our actions, however, may not be sufficient to result in an effective internal control environment, and any future failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could impair the reliability of our financial statements which in turn could harm our business, impair investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and our access to the capital markets, cause the price of our common stock to decline and subject us to regulatory penalties.\nFailure to keep pace with technological change could adversely affect our business.\nAdvances and changes in technology could significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. We face many challenges, including the increased demand for providing customers access to their accounts and the systems to perform banking transactions electronically. Our ability to compete depends on our ability to continue to adapt technology on a timely and cost-effective basis to meet these demands.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively or timely implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers and clients. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are exposed to cybersecurity risks associated with our internet-based systems and online commerce security, including \u201chacking\u201d and \u201cidentify theft.\u201d\nWe conduct a portion of our business over the internet. We rely heavily upon data processing, including loan servicing and deposit processing, software, communications and information systems from a number of third parties to conduct our business. As a bank, we are more likely to be targeted by cyber attacks in an effort to unlawfully access customer funds or customer personally identifiable information.\nThird-party or internal systems and networks may fail to operate properly or become disabled due to deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Our operations are vulnerable to disruptions from human error, natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, spam attacks, denial of service attacks, unauthorized access and other unforeseen events. Undiscovered data corruption could render our customer information inaccurate. These events may obstruct our ability to provide services and process transactions. While we believe we are in compliance with all applicable privacy and data security laws, an incident could put our customer confidential information at risk.\nAlthough we have not experienced a cyber-incident which has been successful in compromising our data or systems, we can never be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to breaches of security or other technological difficulties or failures. We monitor and modify, as necessary, our protective measures in response to the perpetual evolution of known cyber-threats.\nA breach in the security of any of our information systems, or other cyber-incident, could have an adverse impact on, among other things, our revenue, ability to attract and maintain customers and our reputation. In addition, as a result of any breach, we could incur higher costs to conduct our business, to increase protection, or related to remediation. Furthermore, our customers could incorrectly blame us and terminate their account with us for a cyber-incident which occurred on their own system or with that of an unrelated third party. In addition, a security breach could also subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability.\nWe are subject to certain operating risks related to employee error and customer, employee and third party misconduct, which could harm our reputation and business.\nEmployee error or employee and customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, engaging in improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or using confidential information improperly. It is not always possible to prevent employee error or misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. Our necessary dependence upon processing systems to record and process transactions and our large transaction volume may further increase the risk that employee errors, tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. Employee error or misconduct could also subject us to financial claims. If our internal control systems fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured, exceeds applicable insurance limits or if insurance coverage is denied or not available, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFraudulent activity could damage our reputation, disrupt our businesses, increase our costs and cause losses.\nAs a financial institution, we are inherently exposed to operational risk in the form of theft and other fraudulent activity by employees, customers and other third parties targeting us and our customers or data. Such activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Although the Company devotes substantial resources to maintaining effective policies and internal controls to identify and prevent such incidents, given the increasing sophistication of possible perpetrators, the Company may experience financial losses or reputational harm as a result of fraud.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. While we have a practice of seeking to independently verify some of the customer information that we use in deciding whether to extend credit or to agree to a loan modification, including employment, assets, income and credit score, not all customer information is independently verified, and if any of the information that is independently verified (or any other information considered in the loan review process) is misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, the value of the loan may be significantly lower than expected. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the applicant, another third party or one of our employees, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. We may not detect all misrepresented information in our approval process. Any such misrepresented information could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations could be interrupted if our third-party service providers experience difficulty, terminate their services or fail to comply with banking regulations.\nWe depend to a significant extent on a number of relationships with third-party service providers. Specifically, we receive core systems processing, essential web hosting and other internet systems, loan and deposit processing and other processing services from third-party service providers. If these third-party service providers experience financial, operational or technological difficulties or terminate their services and we are unable to replace them with other service providers, our operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Even if we are able to replace our service providers, it may be at a higher cost to us, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, whether due to losses, an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as our ability to maintain regulatory compliance, would be adversely affected.\nOur business strategy calls for continued growth. We may need to raise additional capital in the future to support our continued growth and to maintain our required regulatory capital levels. Our ability to raise additional capital depends on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, and on our financial condition and performance. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital. Moreover, if we need to raise capital in the future, we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital, and we would have to compete with those institutions for investors. Accordingly, there are no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. Our growth may be constrained if we are unable to raise additional capital as needed. Furthermore, if we fail to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe follow a relationship-based operating model and negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings.\nReputation risk, or the risk to our business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract clients and employees and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action and adversely affect our results of operations. Although we take steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with our clients and communities, this risk will always be present given the nature of our business.\nIf third parties infringe upon our intellectual property or if we were to infringe upon the intellectual property of third parties, we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or suffer competitive injury.\nWe rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret laws and confidentiality provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights. If we fail to successfully maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer. Similarly, if we were to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, our competitive position could suffer. Third parties may challenge, invalidate, circumvent, infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property, or such intellectual property may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product or service offerings or other competitive harm. We may also be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. Others, including our competitors, may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products or services or design around our intellectual property, and in such cases we may not be able to assert our intellectual property rights against such parties. Further, our contractual arrangements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information or provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of our confidential or proprietary information. We may have to litigate to enforce or determine the scope and enforceability of our intellectual property rights, trade secrets and know-how, which could be time-consuming and expensive, could cause a diversion of resources and may not prove successful. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to obtain rights with respect to third party intellectual property could harm our business and ability to compete. In addition, because of the rapid pace of technological change in our industry, aspects of our business and our products and services rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms or at all.\nWe may be exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we take title.\nIn the course of our business, we may foreclose and take title to real estate, and we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or we may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe costs and effects of litigation, investigations or similar matters, or adverse facts and developments related thereto, could materially affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation, investigations or similar matters arising out of our business. It is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and we may not prevail in proceedings or litigation. Our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us and indemnification rights to which we are entitled may not be honored, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, premiums for insurance covering the financial and banking sectors are rising. We may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, nor may we be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms or at historic rates, if at all.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business.\nSevere weather, including tornadoes, droughts, hailstorms and other natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses. Operations in our market could be disrupted by both the evacuation of large portions of the population as well as damage and or lack of access to our banking and operation facilities. While we have not experienced such an event to date, other severe weather or natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events may occur in the future. Although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Regulatory Environment\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, which increases the cost and expense of compliance and could limit or restrict our activities, which in turn may adversely impact our earnings and ability to grow.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by a number of governmental regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the OBD, and the FDIC. Regulations adopted by these agencies, which are generally intended to provide protection for depositors, customers and the DIF, rather than for the benefit of shareholders, govern a comprehensive range of matters relating to ownership and control of our shares, our acquisition of other companies and businesses, permissible activities for us to engage in, maintenance of adequate capital levels, dividend payments and other aspects of our operations. These bank regulators possess broad authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law. Following examinations, we may be required, among other things, to change our asset valuations or the amounts of required loan loss allowances or to restrict our operations, as well as increase our capital levels, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time and we cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business, profitability or growth strategy. Increased regulation could increase our cost of compliance and adversely affect profitability. Moreover, certain of these regulations contain significant punitive sanctions for violations, including monetary penalties and limitations on a bank\u2019s ability to implement components of its business plan, such as expansion through mergers and acquisitions or the opening of new branch offices. In addition, changes in regulatory requirements may add costs associated with compliance efforts. Furthermore, government policy and regulation, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve, significantly affect credit conditions. Negative developments in the financial industry and the impact of new legislation and regulation in response to those developments could negatively impact our business operations and adversely impact our financial performance.\nLegislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may increase our costs and impact our business, governance structure, financial condition or results of operations. Proposed legislative and regulatory actions, including changes to financial regulation, may not occur on the timeframe that is expected, or at all, which could result in additional uncertainty for our business.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by multiple regulatory bodies. These regulations may affect the manner and terms of delivery of our services. If we do not comply with governmental regulations, we may be subject to fines, penalties, lawsuits or material restrictions on our businesses which may adversely affect our business operations. Changes in these regulations can significantly affect the services that we provide as well as our costs of compliance with such regulations. In addition, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation arising from the failure or perceived failure to comply with legal, regulatory or contractual requirements could affect our ability to attract and retain customers.\nCurrent and past economic conditions, particularly in the financial markets, have resulted in government regulatory agencies and political bodies placing increased focus and scrutiny on the financial services industry. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. In addition, new proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry, impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices, including in the areas of compensation, interest rates, financial product offerings and disclosures, and have an effect on bankruptcy proceedings with respect to consumer residential real estate mortgages, among other things. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. President Donald Trump issued an executive order directing the review of existing financial regulations. The Trump administration has also indicated in public statements that the Dodd-Frank Act will be under scrutiny and that some of its provisions and the rules promulgated thereunder may be revised, repealed or amended. In May 2018, Congress passed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act, or S. 2155, that provides for certain regulatory relief for community banks, including mortgage lending relief, treatment of reciprocal deposits and capital simplification.\nCertain aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes, including laws applicable to the financial industry and federal and state taxation, if enacted or adopted, may impact the profitability of our business activities, require more oversight or change certain of our business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. These changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations to comply, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any proposed legislative or regulatory changes, including those that could benefit our business, financial condition and results of operations, may not occur on the timeframe that is proposed, or at all, which could result in additional uncertainty for our business.\nMany of our new activities and expansion plans require regulatory approvals, and failure to obtain them may restrict our growth.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may expand our business by pursuing strategic acquisitions of financial institutions and other complementary businesses. Generally, we must receive federal regulatory approval before we can acquire an FDIC-insured depository institution or related business. In determining whether to approve a proposed acquisition, federal banking regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, our financial condition, our future prospects and the impact of the proposal on U.S. financial stability. The regulators also review current and projected capital ratios, the competence, experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served (including the acquiring institution\u2019s record of compliance under the Community Reinvestment Act, or the CRA) and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities. Such regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. We may also be required to sell banking locations as a condition to receiving regulatory approval, which condition may not be acceptable to us or, if acceptable to us, may reduce the benefit of any acquisition.\nIn addition to the acquisition of existing financial institutions, as opportunities arise, we plan to continue de novo branching as a part of our expansion strategy. De novo branching and acquisitions carry with them numerous risks, including the inability to obtain all required regulatory approvals. The failure to obtain these regulatory approvals for potential future strategic acquisitions and de novo banking locations could impact our business plans and restrict our growth.\nThe Federal Reserve may require the Company to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nAs a matter of policy, the Federal Reserve expects a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy on serving as a source of financial strength. Under the \u201csource of strength\u201d doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank, even if the company would not ordinarily do so and even if such contribution is to its detriment or the detriment of its shareholders. The Federal Reserve may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to a subsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times when the holding company may not have the resources to provide it and therefore may be required to borrow the funds or raise capital. The net proceeds from our initial public offering that were paid as a cash distribution to our existing shareholders immediately after the closing of the offering are unavailable for a capital injection into the Bank. Furthermore, any loans by a bank holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank.\nMoreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the institution\u2019s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its indebtedness. Thus, any borrowing that must be incurred by the Company in order to make a required capital injection to the Bank becomes more difficult and expensive and will adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to stringent capital requirements that may limit our operations and potential growth.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet commitments as calculated under these regulations.\nIn order to be a \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d depository institution under prompt corrective action standards, an institution must maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% or more; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or more; a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or more; and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or more. In addition, the Company and the Bank are required to maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0% or more; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5% or more; a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5% or more; and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or more, by January 1, 2019. The failure to meet the established capital requirements under the prompt corrective action framework could result in one or more of our regulators placing limitations or conditions on our activities, including our growth initiatives, or restricting the commencement of new activities, and such failure could subject us to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities, including limiting our ability to pay dividends, issuing a directive to increase our capital and terminating the Bank\u2019s FDIC deposit insurance. FDIC deposit insurance is critical to the continued operation of the Bank. In addition, an inability to meeting the capital requirements under the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, or Basel III, would prevent us from being able to pay certain discretionary bonuses to our executive officers and dividends to our shareholders.\nMany factors affect the calculation of our risk-based assets and our ability to maintain the level of capital required to achieve acceptable capital ratios. For example, changes in risk weightings of assets relative to capital and other factors may combine to increase the amount of risk-weighted assets in the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and the total risk-based capital ratio. Any increases in our risk-weighted assets will require a corresponding increase in our capital to maintain the applicable ratios. In addition, recognized loan losses in excess of amounts reserved for such losses, loan impairments and other factors will decrease our capital, thereby reducing the level of the applicable ratios.\nOur failure to remain well-capitalized for bank regulatory purposes could affect customer and investor confidence, our ability to grow, our costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, our ability to pay dividends on common stock, our ability to make acquisitions, and our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we cease to be a well-capitalized institution for bank regulatory purposes, the interest rates that we pay on deposits and our ability to accept brokered deposits may be restricted.\nHigher FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments could adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain deposit insurance. As an FDIC-insured institution, we are required to pay quarterly deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC. Although we cannot predict what the insurance assessment rates will be in the future, either a deterioration in our risk-based capital ratios or adjustments to the base assessment rates could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBank regulatory agencies periodically examine our business, including compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which we become subject as a result of such examinations could materially and adversely affect us.\nOur regulators periodically examine our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. Accommodating such examinations may require management to reallocate resources, which would otherwise be used in the day-to-day operation of other aspects of our business. If, as a result of an examination, a banking agency were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were, or our management was, in violation of any law or regulation, they may take a number of different remedial actions as they deem appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil money penalties against us, our officers or directors, to fine or remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate the Bank\u2019s FDIC deposit insurance and place the Bank into receivership or conservatorship. Any regulatory action against us could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMonetary policy and other economic factors could affect our profitability adversely.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market purchases and sales of U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in banks\u2019 reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with respect to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, or BSA, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the USA PATRIOT Act, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective AML program and to file reports such as suspicious activity reports and currency transaction reports. We are required to comply with these and other AML requirements. The federal banking agencies and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network are authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and have recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts against banks and other financial services providers with the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the IRS. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, which involve sanctions for dealing with certain persons or countries. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans.\nFailure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nRegulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities.\nWe are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, including requirements concerning security breach notification, and we could be negatively impacted by these laws. For example, our business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which, among other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on our ability to share non-public personal information about our customers with non-affiliated third parties; (ii) requires that we provide certain disclosures to customers about our information collection, sharing and security practices and afford customers the right to \u201copt out\u201d of any information sharing by us with non-affiliated third parties (with certain exceptions) and (iii) requires we develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards appropriate based on our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of customer information we process, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Various state and federal banking regulators and states have also enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Moreover, legislators and regulators in the United States are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer or employee information, and some of our current or planned business activities. This could also increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives. This includes increased privacy-related enforcement activity at the federal level by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as at the state level.\nWe rely on third parties, and in some cases subcontractors, to provide information technology and data services. Although we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts and perform information security risk assessments of its third-party service providers and business associates, we still have limited control over their actions and practices. In addition, despite the security measures the we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism or theft, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. In such cases, notification to affected individuals, state and federal regulators, state attorneys general and media may be required, depending upon the number of affected individuals and whether personal information including financial data was subject to unauthorized access.\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws (including those regarding security breach notification) affecting customer or employee data to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory or governmental investigations or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe face increased risk under the terms of the CRA as we accept additional deposits in new geographic markets.\nUnder the terms of the CRA, each appropriate federal bank regulatory agency is required, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess such bank\u2019s record in assessing and meeting the credit needs of the communities served by that bank, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. During these examinations, the regulatory agency rates such bank\u2019s compliance with the CRA as \u201cOutstanding,\u201d \u201cSatisfactory,\u201d \u201cNeeds to Improve\u201d or \u201cSubstantial Noncompliance.\u201d The regulatory agency\u2019s assessment of the institution\u2019s record is part of the regulatory agency\u2019s consideration of applications to acquire, merge or consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company, or to open or relocate a branch office.\nAs we accept additional deposits in new geographic markets, we will be required to maintain an acceptable CRA rating. Maintaining an acceptable CRA rating may become more difficult as our deposits increase across new geographic markets.\nWe are subject to certain restrictions related to interstate banking and branching, including restrictions on interstate deposits.\nThe Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, or Interstate Act, together with the Dodd-Frank Act, relaxed prior interstate branching restrictions under federal law by permitting, subject to regulatory approval, commercial banks to establish branches in states where the laws permit banks chartered in such states to establish branches. As discussed in this report, the Bank operates branches in Kansas and Texas, in additional to its home state of Oklahoma. Federal banking agency regulations prohibit banks from using their interstate branches primarily for deposit production, and the federal banking agencies have implemented a loan-to-deposit ratio screen to ensure compliance with this prohibition, the purpose of which is to ensure that interstate branches do not take deposits from a community without the bank reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of that community.\nThe prohibition on establishing interstate branches for the purpose of deposit production, and the corresponding regulatory loan-to-deposit restrictions, could limit our ability to establish branches outside Oklahoma. We believe that the Bank\u2019s operations in Texas are in compliance with the Interstate Act in Texas. In addition, we believe that the Bank is reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the Bank\u2019s Kansas branches. If, however, the Federal Reserve were to determine that the Bank is not reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the Bank\u2019s Kansas branches, then the Federal Reserve could require the Bank\u2019s Kansas branches to be closed or not permit the Bank to open new branches in Kansas.\nWe are subject to federal and state fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nFederal and state fair lending laws and regulations, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, or ECOA, and the Fair Housing Act, impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The DOJ, the CFPB, and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation.\nA successful challenge to our performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact our rating under the CRA and result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to liability for potential violations of predatory lending laws, which could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nVarious U.S. federal, state and local laws have been enacted that are designed to discourage predatory lending practices. The U.S. Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994, or HOEPA, prohibits inclusion of certain provisions in mortgages that have interest rates or origination costs in excess of prescribed levels and requires that borrowers be given certain disclosures prior to origination. Some states have enacted, or may enact, similar laws or regulations, which in some cases impose restrictions and requirements greater than those in HOEPA. In addition, under the anti-predatory lending laws of some states, the origination of certain mortgages, including loans that are not classified as \u201chigh-cost\u201d loans under applicable law, must satisfy a net tangible benefit test with respect to the related borrower. Such tests may be highly subjective and open to interpretation. As a result, a court may determine that a home mortgage, for example, does not meet the test even if the related originator reasonably believed that the test was satisfied. If any of our mortgages are found to have been originated in violation of predatory or abusive lending laws, we could incur losses, which could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nRegulatory agencies and consumer advocacy groups have asserted claims that the practices of lenders and loan servicers result in a disparate impact on protected classes.\nAntidiscrimination statutes, such as the Fair Housing Act and the ECOA, prohibit creditors from discriminating against loan applicants and borrowers based on certain characteristics, such as race, religion and national origin. Various federal regulatory agencies and departments, including the DOJ and the CFPB, have taken the position that these laws apply not only to intentional discrimination, but also to neutral practices that have a disparate impact on a group that shares a characteristic that a creditor may not consider in making credit decisions protected classes (i.e., creditor or servicing practices that have a disproportionate negative affect on a protected class of individuals).\nThese regulatory agencies, as well as consumer advocacy groups and plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, have focused greater attention on \u201cdisparate impact\u201d claims. The U.S. Supreme Court has confirmed that the \u201cdisparate impact\u201d theory applies to cases brought under the Fair Housing Act, while emphasizing that a causal relationship must be shown between a specific policy of the defendant and a discriminatory result that is not justified by a legitimate objective of the defendant. Although it is still unclear whether the theory applies under ECOA, regulatory agencies and private plaintiffs may continue to apply it to both the Fair Housing Act and ECOA in the context of mortgage lending and servicing. To the extent that the \u201cdisparate impact\u201d theory continues to apply, we are faced with significant administrative burdens in attempting to comply and potential liability for failures to comply.\nIn addition to reputational harm, violations of the ECOA and the Fair Housing Act can result in actual damages, punitive damages, injunctive or equitable relief, attorneys\u2019 fees and civil money penalties.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThere are no assurances that an active public trading market will develop or persist for our common stock; and, even if it does, our share price may be subject to substantial volatility.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our Company will lead to the development and persistence of an active trading market on the NASDAQ Global Select Market or otherwise, or how liquid that market may be, especially if few stock analysts follow our stock or issue research reports concerning our business. If an active trading market does not develop or persist, it may be difficult to sell our shares. No market maker in our common stock is obligated to make a market in our shares, and any such market making may be discontinued at any time in the sole discretion of each market maker.\nThe price of our common stock could be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among other things:\n\u2022 actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly or annual results of operations;\n\u2022 recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022 operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022 news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry generally;\n\u2022 conditions in the banking industry such as credit quality and monetary policies;\n\u2022 perceptions in the marketplace regarding us or our competitors;\n\u2022 fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;\n\u2022 domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022 general market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry;\n\u2022 new technology used, or services offered, by competitors; and\n\u2022 changes in government regulations.\nIn addition, if the market for stocks in our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and be a distraction to management.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention, which increase our costs of operations and may divert focus from our business operations.\nAs a public company, we face increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses relative to a private company, particularly after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, which requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition and proxy and other information statements, and the rules and regulations implemented by the SEC, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the NASDAQ Global Select Market, each of which imposes additional reporting and other obligations on public companies. As a public company, compliance with these reporting requirements and other SEC and the NASDAQ Global Select Market rules make certain operating activities more time-consuming, and we also incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses. Furthermore, the need to establish and maintain the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert management\u2019s attention from implementing our operating strategy, which could prevent us from successfully implementing our strategic initiatives and improving our results of operations. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a public company. However, we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur in order to comply with these requirements. We anticipate that these costs will materially increase our general and administrative expenses and such increases will reduce our profitability.\nSecurities analysts may not initiate or continue coverage on us.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about us and our business. We do not have any control over these securities analysts, and they may not cover us. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover us or fail to publish regular reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the price or trading volume of our common stock to decline. If we are covered by securities analysts and are the subject of an unfavorable report, the price of our common stock may decline.\nShares of certain shareholders may be sold into the public market. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly.\nOur principal shareholders (collectively, the \u201cHaines Family Trusts\u201d) have the benefit of certain registration rights covering all of their shares of our common stock pursuant to the registration rights agreement that we entered into with the Haines Family Trusts in connection with our initial public offering. Sales of a substantial number of these shares in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or to be lower than it might otherwise be. In addition, as of December 31, 2018 approximately 63.4% of our outstanding common stock is beneficially owned by our principal shareholders, executive officers and directors. The substantial amount of common stock that is owned by and issuable to our principal shareholders, executive officers and directors may adversely affect our share price, our share price volatility and the development and persistence of an active and liquid trading market. The sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nOklahoma law and the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have an anti-takeover effect, and there are substantial regulatory limitations on changes of control of bank holding companies.\nOklahoma corporate law and provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or certificate of incorporation, and our amended and restated bylaws, or bylaws, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial by our shareholders. Furthermore, with certain limited exceptions, federal regulations prohibit a person or company or a group of persons deemed to be \u201cacting in concert\u201d from, directly or indirectly, acquiring more than 10% (5% if the acquirer is a bank holding company) of any class of our voting stock or obtaining the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of our directors or otherwise direct the management or policies of our Company without prior notice or application to and the approval of the Federal Reserve. Accordingly, prospective investors need to be aware of and comply with these requirements, if applicable, in connection with any purchase of shares of our common stock. Collectively, provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and other statutory and regulatory provisions may delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our shareholders receiving a premium over the market price for their common stock. Moreover, the combination of these provisions effectively inhibits certain business combinations, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are controlled by trusts established for the benefit of members of the Haines family, whose interests may not coincide with our other shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Haines Family Trusts control approximately 63% our common stock. So long as the Haines Family Trusts continue to control more than 50% of our outstanding shares of common stock, they will have the ability, if they vote in the same manner, to determine the outcome of all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, the approval of mergers, material acquisitions and dispositions and other extraordinary transactions, and amendments to our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other corporate governance documents. In addition, this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control of our Company and make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of the Haines Family Trusts. The Haines Family Trusts also have certain rights, such as registration rights, that our other shareholders do not have. In any of these matters, the interests of the Haines Family Trusts may differ from or conflict with our interests as a company or the interests of other shareholders. Accordingly, the Haines Family Trusts could influence us to enter into transactions or agreements that other shareholders would not approve or make decisions with which other shareholders may disagree.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the rules of NASDAQ, and qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. As a result, our shareholders do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under NASDAQ\u2019s corporate governance listing standards, meaning that more than 50% of the voting power for the election of our board of directors will be held by a single person, entity or group. As a controlled company, we are exempt from the obligation to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirements:\n\u2022 that a majority of our board of directors consists of \u201cindependent directors,\u201d as defined under NASDAQ rules;\n\u2022 that director nominations are selected, or recommended for the board of directors\u2019 selection, by either (i) the independent directors constituting a majority of the board of directors\u2019 independent directors in a vote in which only independent directors participate, or (ii) a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors; and\n\u2022 that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors.\nEven though we are a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we currently intend to comply with each of these requirements. However, we may avail ourselves of certain of these other exemptions for as long as we remain a \u201ccontrolled company.\u201d Accordingly, our shareholders may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of NASDAQ\u2019s corporate governance requirements, which could make our stock less attractive to investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nFuture equity issuances could result in dilution, which could cause the price of our shares of common stock to decline.\nWe are generally not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock, up to the 50,000,000 shares of voting common stock and 20,000,000 shares of non-voting common stock authorized in our certificate of incorporation. We may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future pursuant to current or future equity compensation plans, upon conversions of preferred stock or debt, upon exercise of warrants or in connection with future acquisitions or financings. If we choose to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, or securities convertible into shares of our common stock, for any reason, the issuance would have a dilutive effect on the holders of our common stock and could have a material negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe may issue shares of non-voting common stock or preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock.\nAlthough there are currently no shares of our non-voting common stock or preferred stock outstanding, our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of one or more series of non-voting common stock and up to 1,000,000 shares of one or more series of preferred stock. The board of directors has the power to set the terms of any series of non-voting common stock or preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, conversion rights, preferences over our voting common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up and other terms. If we issue non-voting common stock or preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue non-voting common stock or preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of the holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nWe have limited the circumstances in which our directors will be liable for monetary damages.\nWe have included in our certificate of incorporation a provision to eliminate the liability of directors for monetary damages to the maximum extent permitted by Oklahoma law. The effect of this provision will be to reduce the situations in which we or our shareholders will be able to seek monetary damages from our directors.\nOur certificate of incorporation also has a provision providing for indemnification of our directors and executive officers and advancement of expenses to the fullest extent permitted or required by Oklahoma law, including circumstances in which indemnification is otherwise discretionary. In connection with our initial public offering, we also entered into agreements with our officers and directors in which we similarly agreed to provide indemnification that is otherwise discretionary.\nOur bylaws have an exclusive forum provision, which could limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur bylaws have an exclusive forum provision providing that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the state or federal courts for the Western District of Oklahoma are the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, (ii) any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, employee or agent of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s shareholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act, or OGCA, the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to said courts having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. Any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this provision of our certificate of incorporation. The exclusive forum provision may limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find the exclusive forum provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur dividend policy may change without notice, and our future ability to pay dividends is subject to restrictions.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such cash dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Any declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock will depend upon our earnings and financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, the general economic and regulatory climate, our ability to service any equity or debt obligations senior to our common stock and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Furthermore, consistent with our strategic plans, growth initiatives, capital availability, projected liquidity needs and other factors, we have made, and will continue to make, capital management decisions and policies that could adversely affect the amount of dividends, if any, paid to our common shareholders.\nThe Federal Reserve has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy in relation to the organization\u2019s overall asset quality, current and prospective earnings and level, composition and quality of capital. The guidance provides that we inform and consult with the Federal Reserve prior to declaring and paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in an adverse change to our capital structure, including interest on any debt obligations. If required payments on our debt obligations are not made, or dividends on any preferred stock we may issue are not paid, we will be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock.\nWe are a bank holding company and our only source of cash, other than further issuances of securities, is distributions from the Bank.\nWe are a bank holding company with no material activities other than activities incidental to holding the common stock of the Bank. Our principal source of funds to pay distributions on our common stock and service any of our obligations, other than further issuances of securities, would be dividends received from the Bank. Furthermore, the Bank is not obligated to pay dividends to us, and any dividends paid to us would depend on the earnings or financial condition of the Bank and various business considerations. As is the case with all financial institutions, the profitability of the Bank is subject to the fluctuating cost and availability of money, changes in interest rates and in economic conditions in general. In addition, various federal and state statutes limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Company without regulatory approval.\nPrior to our initial public offering, we were treated as an S Corporation, and claims of taxing authorities related to our prior status as an S Corporation could harm us.\u2009\nUpon consummation of our initial public offering, our status as an S Corporation terminated and we became taxed as a C Corporation under the provisions of Sections 301 to 385 of the Code, which treat the corporation as an entity that is subject to an entity level U.S. federal income tax. If the unaudited, open tax years in which we were an S Corporation are audited by the IRS, and we are determined not to have qualified for, or to have violated, our S Corporation status, we likely would be obligated to pay corporate level tax, plus interest and possible penalties. This could result in tax with respect to all of the income we reported for periods when we believed we properly were treated as an S Corporation not subject to entity level taxation. Under the terms of a tax sharing agreement entered into by the Company and the Haines Family Trusts, the Haines Family Trusts will indemnify us with respect to our unpaid tax liabilities (including interest and penalties) to the extent that such unpaid tax liabilities are attributable to a decrease in the shareholders\u2019 taxable income for any tax period and a corresponding increase in the Company\u2019s taxable income for any period. This indemnity includes any additional taxes resulting from the Company not being a valid S Corporation. Any such claims, however, could result in additional costs to us and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have entered into a tax sharing agreement with the Haines Family Trusts, and we could become obligated to make payments to the Haines Family Trusts for any additional federal, state or local income taxes assessed against them for tax periods prior to the completion of our initial public offering.\nPrior to our initial public offering, we were treated as an S Corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, the Haines Family Trusts, as our shareholders, were taxed on our income. Therefore, the Haines Family Trusts have received certain distributions from us that were generally intended to equal the amount of tax such trusts were required to pay with respect to our income. In connection with our initial public offering, our S Corporation status terminated. As a result of such termination, we are subject to federal and state income taxes. In the event an adjustment to our taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the date of the termination of our S Corporation status results in any increase in taxable income of the Haines Family Trusts for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending prior to termination of our S Corporation status, it is possible that the Haines Family Trusts would be liable for additional income taxes for such prior periods. Therefore, we have entered into an agreement with the Haines Family Trusts. Pursuant to this agreement, in the event of any restatement of our taxable income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the date of termination of our S Corporation status pursuant to a determination by, or a settlement with, a taxing authority, then, depending on the nature of the adjustment, we may be required to make a payment to the Haines Family Trusts in an amount equal to their incremental tax liability, which amount may be material. In addition, we will indemnify the Haines Family Trusts with respect to unpaid income tax liabilities to the extent that such unpaid income tax liabilities are attributable to our taxable income for any period after our S Corporation status terminates. In both cases, the amount of the payment will be based on the assumption that the Haines Family Trusts are taxed at the highest rate applicable to individuals for the relevant periods. We will also indemnify the Haines Family Trusts for any interest, penalties, losses, costs or expenses arising out of any claim under the agreement. However, the Haines Family Trusts will indemnify us with respect to our unpaid tax liabilities (including interest and penalties) to the extent that such unpaid tax liabilities are attributable to a decrease in the shareholders\u2019 taxable income for any for tax period and a corresponding increase in the Company\u2019s taxable income for any period. The Haines Family Trusts will also indemnify the Company with respect to any additional taxes attributable to our final S Corporation tax year that ends with the termination of our S Corporation status.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. These include, without limitation, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced financial reporting requirements, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. The JOBS Act also permits an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We have elected to, and expect to continue to, take advantage of certain of these and other exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. Further, the JOBS Act allows us to present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and provide less than five years of selected financial data in this report.\nWe may take advantage of these provisions for up to five years, unless we earlier cease to be an emerging growth company, which would occur if our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period or if we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions, or if we choose to rely on additional exemptions in the future. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our share price may be more volatile.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit and is subject to risk of loss.\nAn investment in our common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not be insured against loss or guaranteed by the FDIC, any deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described herein, and is subject to similar market forces that may affect the price of common stock in any other company. As a result, a holder of our common stock could lose some or all of the holder\u2019s investment.", "PERMNO": 18106, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BSVN"}
