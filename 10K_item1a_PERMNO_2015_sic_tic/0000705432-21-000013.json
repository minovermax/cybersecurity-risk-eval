RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the risk factors and uncertainties discussed in our other public filings with the SEC under the caption \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in evaluating us and our business and making or continuing an investment in our stock. Set forth below are the material risks and uncertainties that, if they were to occur, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our financial condition and business operations. The trading price of our securities could decline due to the materialization of any of these risks, and our shareholders may lose all or part of their investment. This Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that may not be realized as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, the risks described herein and in our other public filings with the SEC. Please refer to the section in this Form 10-K entitled \u201cSpecial Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for additional information regarding forward-looking statements.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nThe novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has adversely affected our business, financial condition, results of operations and our liquidity and will likely continue to for the foreseeable future.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted financial markets both globally and within the United States and has resulted in a global recession. The preventive measures taken to halt the spread of COVID-19 have significantly reduced commercial and consumer activity, financial transactions, increased unemployment and market instability and resulted in material decreases in oil and gas prices. The disruption of COVID-19 and the associated preventive measures is expected to disrupt the activities and business operations of our customers, as well as our own business operations, until the pandemic subsides.\nThe Federal Reserve lowered the primary credit rate by 50 and 100 basis points on March 3 and March 15, 2020, respectively, for a total of 150 basis points to 0.25 percent to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and to support the liquidity and stability of banking institutions as they serve the increased demand for credit. A long duration of reduced interest rates could negatively impact our net interest income, margin, cost of borrowing and future profitability and have a material adverse effect on our financial results. The continued spread of COVID-19, prolonged orders to social distance, prolonged closures of workplaces and other businesses and an increase in the unemployment rate within the communities we serve, may also impair the ability of our borrowers to make their monthly loan payments, which would result in increases in delinquencies, declining collateral values, defaults, foreclosures and other losses on our loans as well as impact our operations and business. A protracted COVID-19 pandemic could further negatively affect the carrying amount of our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangibles and long-lived assets and result in realized losses on our financial assets. In addition, a decline in consumer confidence also could result in lower loan originations and decreases in deposits. It is not possible to predict the extent, severity or duration of these conditions or when normal economic and operating conditions will resume.\nIn order to protect the health of our customers and employees, and to comply with applicable government restrictions, we have modified our business practices, including restricting employee travel, directing employees to work remotely, cancelling in-person meetings and implementing our business continuity plans and protocols to the extent necessary. In compliance with social distancing guidelines issued by federal, state and local governments, we initially closed all of our grocery store branches. As stay-at-home orders were issued by local governments in our market areas to combat the spread of the virus, we closed all traditional lobbies and wealth management and trust offices to walk-in customers, however, most of these traditional locations were offering certain services by appointment only. All other banking services were available to customers through our drive-thrus, ATMs/ITMs and automated telephone, internet and mobile banking products. After careful consideration and implementation of additional precautions, all locations were reopened on June 1, 2020. We have since adjusted select branch hours and openings, and we continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation. We may take further such actions that we determine are in the best interest of our employees, customers and communities or as may be required by government order. There is no assurance that these actions will be sufficient to successfully mitigate the risks presented by the pandemic or that our ability to operate will not be materially affected.\nAdditionally, COVID-19 could negatively affect our internal controls over financial reporting as many of our employees are required to work from home and therefore new processes, procedures, and controls could be required to respond to changes in our business environment. The increased reliance on remote access to information systems increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity breaches as well as the information systems of our vendors or business partners. Further, should any key employees become ill from the coronavirus and unable to work, the attention of the management team could be diverted.\nFederal, state and local governments have mandated or encouraged financial services companies to make accommodations to borrowers and other customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Legal and regulatory responses to concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic could result in additional regulation or restrictions affecting the conduct of our\nbusiness in the future. In addition to the potential effects from negative economic conditions noted above, we instituted a program to help customers financially impacted by COVID-19. This program includes waiving certain fees and monthly service charges and offering payment deferment and other loan relief, as appropriate, for customers impacted by COVID-19. Our liquidity could be negatively impacted if a significant number of customers apply and are approved for the deferral of payments. In addition, if these deferrals are not effective in mitigating the financial effect of COVID-19 on our customers, it may adversely affect our business and results of operations more substantially over a longer period of time. In addition, a significant amount of the loan growth we experienced during the second quarter of 2020 was a direct result of PPP loans. This loan growth is likely to end in the near-term. Furthermore, there has been litigation against banks related to their participation in the PPP and other government stimulus programs, the costs and effects of which could be material to us.\nThe potential effects of COVID-19 also could impact and heighten many of our risk factors noted below, including, but not limited to: risks associated with information technology and systems, including service interruptions or security breaches; disruptions in services provided by third parties; projections related to U.S. agency MBS prepayments; changes in our management team or other key personnel and our ability to hire or retain key personnel; the analytical and forecasting models we use to estimate our credit losses and to measure the fair value of our financial instruments; our balance sheet strategy; our processes for managing risk; general political or economic conditions in the U.S.; economic conditions in the State of Texas; funding to provide liquidity; the failure to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures, including internal control over financial reporting; the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets; declining crude oil prices; the impact of governmental regulation and supervision; the soundness of other financial institutions; and volatility in our stock price. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic persists and continues to evolve, the potential impacts to our risk factors that are further described below, remain uncertain.\nWe are subject to credit quality risks and our credit policies may not be sufficient to avoid losses.\nWe are subject to the risk of losses resulting from the failure of borrowers, guarantors and related parties to pay us the interest and principal amounts due on their loans. Although we maintain well-defined credit policies and credit underwriting and monitoring and collection procedures, these policies and procedures may not prevent losses, particularly during periods in which the local, regional or national economy suffers a general decline. The future effects of COVID-19 on economic activity could negatively affect the collateral values associated with our existing loans, the ability to liquidate the real estate collateral securing our residential and commercial real estate loans, our ability to maintain loan origination volume and to obtain additional financing, the future demand for or profitability of our lending and services, and the financial condition and credit risk of our customers. Further, in the event of delinquencies, regulatory changes and policies designed to protect borrowers may slow or prevent us from making our business decisions or may result in a delay in our taking certain remediation actions, such as foreclosure. If borrowers fail to repay their loans, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe have a high concentration of loans secured by real estate and a decline in the real estate market, for any reason, could result in losses and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is dependent on real estate. In addition to the importance of the financial strength and cash flow characteristics of the borrower, loans are also often secured with real estate collateral. At December 31, 2020, approximately 71.0% of our loans have real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. The real estate in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. Beginning in the third quarter of 2007 and continuing until 2010, there was significant deterioration in the credit markets, beginning with a decline in the sub-prime mortgage lending market, which later extended to the markets for CMOs, MBS and the lending markets generally. This decline resulted in restrictions in the resale markets during 2011 and 2012 for non-conforming loans and had an adverse effect on retail mortgage lending operations in many markets. A decline in the credit markets generally could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to extend credit or sell loans in the secondary market. An adverse change in the economy affecting real estate values generally or in our primary markets specifically could significantly impair the value of collateral underlying certain of our loans and our ability to sell the collateral at a profit or at all upon foreclosure. Furthermore, it is likely that, in a declining real estate market, we would be required to further increase our allowance for loan losses. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values or to increase our allowance for loan losses, our profitability and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Our communications and information systems remain vulnerable to unexpected disruptions and failures. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of a failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that we can prevent any such failures, interruptions, cyber\nsecurity breaches or other security breaches or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn our ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our businesses and to collect and store sensitive data, including financial information regarding our customers and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees. The integrity of information systems of financial institutions is under significant threat from cyber-attacks by third parties, including through coordinated attacks sponsored by foreign nations and criminal organizations to disrupt business operations and other compromises to data and systems for political or criminal purposes. We employ an in-depth, layered, defense approach that leverages people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cyber security controls.\nNotwithstanding the strength of our defensive measures, the threat from cyber-attacks is severe, attacks are sophisticated, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. Cyber security risks may also occur with our third-party service providers, and may interfere with their ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, with potential for financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. We offer our customers the ability to bank remotely and provide other technology-based products and services, which services include the secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet and other remote channels. To the extent that our customers\u2019 systems are not secure or are otherwise compromised, our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, malicious software, phishing schemes and other security breaches. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers or third-party service providers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and malicious software could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other possible liabilities.\nIn addition, in response to COVID-19, we have modified our business practices with a portion of our employees working remotely from their homes to have our operations uninterrupted as much as possible. Further, consumer technology in employees\u2019 homes may not provide similar performance as commercial-grade technology in our offices. This along with reliance on employees\u2019 residential internet could cause network, system, application, and communication limitations or instability, affecting customer experience for some departments. The continuation of these work-from-home measures also introduces additional operational risk, including increased cybersecurity risk. These cyber risks include greater phishing, malware, and other social engineering attacks targeted at employees working from home. Increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of confidential information, greater risk of privacy breach due to screen/voice/video conversation outside private office space, limited ability to restore the systems in the event of a system failure or interruption, greater risk of a security breach resulting in destruction or misuse of valuable information, and potential impairment of our ability to perform critical functions, including wiring funds, all of which could expose us to risks of data or financial loss, litigation and liability and could seriously disrupt our operations and the operations of any impacted customers.\nWhile to date we have not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or material financial losses related to cyber security attacks, our systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat, and it is possible that we could experience a significant event in the future. We may suffer material financial losses related to these risks in the future or we may be subject to liability for compromises to our customer or third-party service provider systems. Any such losses or liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations and could expose us to reputation risk, the loss of customer business, increased operational costs, as well as additional regulatory scrutiny, possible litigation and related financial liability. These risks also include possible business interruption, including the inability to access critical information and systems.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird parties provide key components of our business infrastructure, such as banking services, core processing and internet connections and network access. Any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise to conduct business. Technological or financial difficulties of one of our third-party service providers or their subcontractors could adversely affect our business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. In addition, one or more of our third-party service providers may become subject to cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our customers\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations. While we have processes in place to monitor our third-party service providers\u2019 data and information security safeguards, we do not control such service providers\u2019 day to day operations, and a successful attack or security breach at one or more of such third-party service providers is not within our control. The occurrence of any such breaches or failures could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny, civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect\non our financial condition and results of operations. Further, in some instances we may be held responsible for the failure of such third parties to comply with government regulations. We may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third-party failures, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures, third-party breaches or other disruptions. Failures in our business structure or in the structure of one or more of our third-party service providers could interrupt the operations or increase the cost of doing business.\nWe continually encounter technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers, and even if we implement such products and services, we may incur substantial costs in doing so. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur earnings are subject to interest rate risk.\nOur earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy, interest rates, the yield curve, or market risk spreads, or a prolonged, flat or inverted yield curve could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect:\n\u2022our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits;\n\u2022our ability to retain deposits in a rising rate environment;\n\u2022net interest rate spreads and net interest rate margins;\n\u2022our ability to enter into instruments to hedge against interest rate risk;\n\u2022the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities; and\n\u2022the average duration of our loan and MBS portfolio.\nIf the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings.\nAny substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See the section captioned \u201cNet Interest Income\u201d in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in this report for further discussion related to our management of interest rate risk.\nWe are subject to the risk that our U.S. agency MBS could prepay faster than we have projected.\nWe have and may continue to purchase MBS at premiums due to the low interest rate environment. Our prepayment assumptions take into account market consensus speeds, current trends and past experience. If actual prepayments exceed our projections, the amortization expense associated with these MBS will increase, thereby decreasing our net income. The increase in amortization expense and the corresponding decrease in net income could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on dividends from our bank subsidiary for most of our revenue.\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc. is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. We receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends from our subsidiary Southside Bank. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common stock to our shareholders and interest and principal on our debt. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that Southside Bank and certain of our nonbank subsidiaries may pay to us. In addition, Southside Bancshares, Inc.\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. In the event Southside Bank is unable to pay dividends to Southside Bancshares, Inc., we may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends to our\nshareholders. The inability to receive dividends from Southside Bank could have a material adverse effect on Southside Bancshares, Inc.\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. See the section captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d and \u201cNote 13 - Shareholders\u2019 Equity\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nYou may not receive dividends on our common stock.\nAlthough we have historically declared quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and may reduce or cease to pay common stock dividends in the future. If we reduce or cease to pay common stock dividends, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nAs noted above, our ability to pay dividends depends primarily upon the receipt of dividends or other capital distributions from Southside Bank. Southside Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us is subject to, among other things, its earnings, financial condition and need for funds, as well as federal and state governmental policies and regulations applicable to us and Southside Bank, including the statutory requirement that we serve as a source of financial strength for Southside Bank, which limit the amount that may be paid as dividends without prior regulatory approval. Notably, in 2020, in direct response to potential adverse financial impacts caused by COVID-19, the Federal Reserve capped dividend payments and suspended share repurchases by several large banks (i.e., those with more than $50 billion in total assets). Though temporary (and not applicable to the Company or Southside Bank), these measures highlight the sensitivity of the bank regulators to the potential financial impacts of COVID-19. Additionally, if Southside Bank\u2019s earnings are not sufficient to pay dividends to us while maintaining adequate capital levels, we may not be able to pay dividends to our shareholders. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation - Holding Company Regulation - Dividends\u201d included in this report.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain skilled personnel.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Competition for the best personnel in most activities we engage in can be intense, and we may not be able to hire personnel or to retain them. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our market, relationships in the communities we serve, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. Although we have employment agreements with certain of our executive officers, there is no guarantee that these officers and other key personnel will remain employed with the Company.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and market area.\nWe face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources. Such competitors primarily include national, regional and community banks within the various markets we operate. Additionally, various out-of-state banks have entered or have announced plans to enter the market areas in which we currently operate. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes, continued consolidation and recent trends in the credit and mortgage lending markets. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can be affiliated under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer certain products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Our competitors may have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets;\n\u2022the ability to expand our market position;\n\u2022the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;\n\u2022the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors;\n\u2022our ability to invest in or partner with technology providers offering banking solutions and delivery channels at a level equal to our competitors;\n\u2022customer satisfaction with our level of service; and\n\u2022industry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models.\nThe process we use to estimate our loan losses and to measure our pension plan liabilities and the fair value of our financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, depend upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances, as we have experienced and expect to continue to experience as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The adoption of CECL in 2020 increased the complexity of these analytical and forecasting models. Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation. If the models we use for interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, we may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. If the methodology we use for determining our loan losses are inadequate, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs. If the models we use to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what we could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. If the key assumptions and models used to measure the defined benefit pension plan liabilities and expense are inadequate, the liability may not accurately reflect the amount required to fund the benefit obligation. Any such failure in our analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur allowance for loan losses may be insufficient.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense. This allowance represents management\u2019s best estimate of expected losses that may occur over the contractual life of our current loan portfolio. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks expected in the loan portfolio considering historical losses, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks; loan loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; present and forecasted economic, political and regulatory conditions, including the impact of COVID-19 and the recent election; and unidentified losses expected in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting the value of properties used as collateral for loans, problems affecting the credit of borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Business and consumer customers of Southside Bank may be currently experiencing varying degrees of financial distress, which may continue over the coming months and may adversely affect their ability to timely pay interest and principal on their loans and the value of the collateral securing their obligations. This in turn may influence the recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and may increase our allowance for credit losses, particularly should businesses remain closed and should more customers draw on their lines of credit or seek additional loans to help finance their businesses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs (in accordance with GAAP), based on judgments different than those of management. If charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, we may need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses. Any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in accounting standards, including the implementation of CECL methodology, could materially affect how we report our financial results.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board adopted a new accounting standard for determining the amount of our allowance for CECL (ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)) that became effective for us on January 1, 2020. Implementation of CECL requires that we determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected future credit losses on loans in the provision for loan losses in the period when the loans are booked. Although currently immaterial, securities classified as HTM are handled similarly. The ongoing impact of CECL will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of our loan portfolio, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts. Should these factors materially change, we may be required to increase our allowance for loan losses, decreasing our reported income and introducing additional volatility into our reported earnings.\nASU 2016-13 also changes the impairment model for investment securities classified as AFS. Under the new impairment model, an AFS investment security is considered impaired when it experiences a decline in fair value below its amortized cost basis. At each measurement date, we determine how much of the decline in fair value below amortized cost\nbasis is due to credit-related factors and how much of the decline is due to noncredit-related factors. Credit-related impairment is recognized as an allowance on our balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to earnings. Any impairment that is not credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.\nThe process for determining whether or not an AFS investment security\u2019s decline in fair value below its amortized cost basis is credit-related will require complex, subjective judgments including, but not limited to, the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, any adverse conditions specifically related to the investment security (including changes to its industry and geographic area), the payment structure of the investment security, failure of the issuer of the investment security to make scheduled payments of principal and interest, and any changes to the rating of the investment security by a rating agency.\nOur interest rate risk, liquidity, fair value of securities and profitability are dependent upon the successful management of our balance sheet strategy.\nWe implemented a balance sheet strategy for the purpose of enhancing overall profitability by maximizing the use of our capital. The effectiveness of our balance sheet strategy, and therefore our profitability, may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including reduced net interest margin and spread, adverse changes in the market liquidity and fair value of our investment securities and U.S. agency MBS, incorrect modeling results due to the unpredictable nature of MBS prepayments, the length of interest rate cycles and the slope of the interest rate yield curve. In addition, we may not be able to obtain wholesale funding to profitably and properly fund our balance sheet strategy. If our balance sheet strategy is flawed or poorly implemented, we may incur significant losses. See the section captioned \u201cBalance Sheet Strategy\u201d in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in this report for further discussion related to our balance sheet strategy.\nOur process for managing risk may not be effective in mitigating risk or losses to us.\nThe objectives of our risk management processes are to mitigate risk and loss to our organization. We have established procedures that are intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risks to which we are subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, operational risk, cybersecurity risk, legal and compliance risk and reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk management processes, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. The ongoing developments in the financial institutions industry continue to highlight both the importance and some of the limitations of managing unanticipated risks. If our risk management processes prove ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may implement new delivery systems, such as internet banking, or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. In developing and marketing new delivery systems and/or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAcquisitions and potential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value.\nWe occasionally evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place, and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur at any time. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and fair values, and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence and/or other projected benefits and synergies from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral political or economic conditions in the United States could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe state of the economy and various economic, social and political factors, including inflation, recession, pandemics, unemployment, interest rates, declining oil prices and the level of U.S. debt, as well as governmental action and uncertainty\nresulting from U.S. and global political trends, including weakness in foreign sovereign debt and currencies, the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union and the economic impact of COVID-19, may directly and indirectly have a destabilizing effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Unfavorable or uncertain international, national or regional political or economic environments could drive losses beyond those which are provided for in our allowance for loan losses and result in the following consequences:\n\u2022increases in loan delinquencies;\n\u2022increases in nonperforming assets and foreclosures;\n\u2022decreases in demand for our products and services, which could adversely affect our liquidity position;\n\u2022decreases in the value of the collateral securing our loans, especially real estate, which could reduce customers\u2019 borrowing power;\n\u2022decreases in the credit quality of our non-U.S. Government and non-U.S. agency investment securities, corporate and municipal securities;\n\u2022an adverse or unfavorable resolution of the Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac receivership; and\n\u2022decreases in the real estate values subject to ad-valorem taxes by municipalities that impact such municipalities\u2019 ability to repay their debt, which could adversely affect our municipal loans or debt securities.\nAny of the foregoing could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nOur profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the State of Texas.\nOur success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the State of Texas and the specific local markets within Texas in which we operate. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in the State of Texas and the local markets in which we operate within Texas. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services, as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing our loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources. Moreover, substantially all of the securities in our municipal bond portfolio were issued by political subdivisions and agencies within the State of Texas. A significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by inflation, recession, crude oil prices, acts of terrorism, pandemics, outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences, unemployment, plant or business closings or downsizing, changes in securities markets or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFunding to provide liquidity may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all.\nLiquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. The liquidity of Southside Bank is necessary to make loans and leases and to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers. Liquidity policies and limits are established by our board of directors. Management and our asset liability committee regularly monitor the overall liquidity position of Southside Bank and the Company to ensure that various alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. Management and our asset liability committee also establish policies and monitor guidelines to diversify Southside Bank\u2019s funding sources to avoid concentrations in excess of board-approved policies from any one market source. Funding sources include federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements, noncore deposits and short- and long-term debt. Southside Bank is also a member of the FHLB System, which provides funding through advance agreements to members that are collateralized with U.S. Treasury securities, MBS, commercial MBS and loans.\nWe maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity. Other sources of liquidity include sales or securitizations of loans, our ability to acquire additional national market, noncore deposits, additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advance agreements, the issuance and sale of debt securities and the issuance and sale of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions. Southside Bank also can borrow from the FRDW.\nWe have historically had access to a number of alternative sources of liquidity, but if there is an increase in volatility in the credit and liquidity markets similar to 2008, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such liquidity on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. The cost of out-of-market deposits may exceed the cost of deposits of similar maturity in our local market area, making such deposits unattractive sources of funding; financial institutions may be unwilling to extend credit to banks because of concerns about the banking industry and the economy in general, and there may not be a viable market for raising equity capital.\nIf we were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed, we might be unable to meet customers\u2019 needs, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity and level of regulatory-qualifying capital.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures, including internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. In addition, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm the trading price of our common stock.\nManagement regularly monitors, reviews and updates our disclosure controls and procedures, including our internal control over financial reporting. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable assurances that the controls will be effective. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could prevent us from accurately reporting our financial results, preventing or detecting fraud or providing timely and reliable financial information pursuant to our reporting obligations, which could result in a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting and the restatement of previously filed financial statements and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, ineffective internal controls could cause our investors to lose confidence in our financial information, which could affect the trading price of our common stock.\nThe value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $210.9 million of goodwill and other intangible assets. A significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock may necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased regulatory oversight, uncertainty relating to the LIBOR calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect the results of our operations.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The IBA, the administrator of LIBOR, announced on November 30, 2020, that it would cease publishing the one-week and two-month LIBOR rates on December 31, 2021, but would continue publishing the one-, three-, six-, and twelve-month LIBOR rates until June 30, 2023. Regardless, the federal banking agencies also issued guidance on November 30, 2020, encouraging banks to (i) stop using LIBOR in new financial contracts no later than December 31, 2021; and (ii) either use a rate other than LIBOR or include clear language defining the alternative rate that will be applicable after LIBOR\u2019s discontinuation. At this time, it is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions for the calculation of LIBOR. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark prior to its 2023 retirement, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments.\nIn particular, regulators, industry groups and certain committees (e.g., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee) have, among other things, published recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether these specific recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments.\nWe have a significant number of loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR could create considerable costs and additional risk. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition will change our market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies.\nAlthough we are currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations. Any failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could also adversely impact our reputation.\nWe are subject to environmental liability as a result of certain lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. There is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental remediation may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we have policies and procedures that require us to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on nonresidential real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by declining crude oil prices.\nAt one point during 2014, the price per barrel of crude oil traded above $100. Since 2015 the market price of a barrel of crude oil has been extremely volatile. To partially mitigate this volatility, oil producers have found ways to reduce production costs. During 2020, as the pandemic unfolded and worldwide economic activity slowed dramatically, demand for crude oil immediately declined as did the price per barrel of crude oil, which at one point went negative. As of December 31, 2020, the price per barrel of crude oil was approximately $48. Decreased market oil prices compressed margins for many U.S. and Texas-based oil producers, as well as oilfield service providers, energy equipment manufacturers and transportation suppliers, among others. As of December 31, 2020, energy loans comprised approximately 2.86% of our loan portfolio. Energy production and related industries represent a significant part of the economies in our primary markets. If oil prices remain at these low levels, or move lower, for an extended period, we could experience weaker loan demand from the energy industry and increased losses within our energy portfolio. A prolonged period of low oil prices could also have a negative impact on the U.S. economy and, in particular, the economies of energy-dominant states such as Texas, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, climate change, acts of war or terrorism, health emergencies, epidemics or pandemics and other external events could significantly impact our business.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, climate change, acts of war or terrorism, health emergencies, epidemics or pandemics and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. For example, because of our location and the location of the market areas we serve, severe weather is more likely than in other areas of the country. Although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, there can be no assurance of the effectiveness of such policies and procedures, and the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BANKING INDUSTRY\nWe are subject or may become subject to extensive government regulation and supervision.\nSouthside Bancshares, Inc., primarily through Southside Bank, and certain of its nonbank subsidiaries, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not shareholders. These regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices and dividend policy and growth, among other things. The statutory and regulatory framework under which we operate has changed substantially as the result of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Basel III Capital Rules, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulations and the California Consumer Privacy Act. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial services industry, addressing, among other things, systemic risk, capital adequacy, deposit insurance assessments, consumer financial protection, as implemented through the Bureau, interchange fees, derivatives, lending limits, mortgage lending practices, registration of investment advisors and changes among bank regulatory authorities. In addition, Congress and federal and state regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit deposit fees and other types of fees we charge, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and/or increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. While we cannot predict the impact of regulatory changes that may arise out of the current financial and economic environment, any regulatory changes or increased regulatory scrutiny could increase costs directly related to complying with new regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While our policies and procedures are designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur. See the section captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d and \u201cNote 13 - Shareholders\u2019 Equity\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nWe may become subject to increased regulatory capital requirements.\nThe capital requirements applicable to Southside Bancshares, Inc. and Southside Bank are subject to change as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the international regulatory capital initiative known as Basel III and any other future government actions. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act eliminates the Tier 1 capital treatment for most trust preferred securities after a three-year phase-in period that began January 1, 2013 for institutions that exceed $15 billion in assets. Furthermore, each of the federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, has issued substantially similar risk-based and leverage capital guidelines applicable to the banking organizations they supervise. As a result of new regulations, we were required to begin complying with higher minimum capital requirements as of January 1, 2015. The 2015 Capital Rules implemented certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III. These 2015 Capital Rules also make important changes to the prompt corrective action framework. Similarly, the 2018 Capital Rules issued by the federal banking agencies will impact our capital calculations by changing the methodology for calculating and reporting incurred losses on certain assets. For additional discussion relating to capital adequacy refer to \u201cItem 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation - Capital Adequacy\u201d in this report. The Company believes it will continue to meet the new capital guidelines, however complying with any higher 2015 Capital Rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act or Basel III, and/or the 2018 Capital Rules mandated by the federal banking agencies, may affect our operations, including our asset portfolios and financial performance.\nChanges in accounting and tax rules applicable to banks could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, the FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in us restating prior period financial statements. For a discussion of the reporting and accounting implications to the Company and Southside Bank resulting from recent changes to the tax laws, refer to \u201cItem 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation - Regulatory Examination\u201d in this report.\nFinancial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties and inaccuracies in such information, including as a result of fraud, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with third parties, we rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties or other third parties, such as independent auditors or property appraisers, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Such information could turn out to be\ninaccurate, including as a result of fraud on behalf of our customers, counterparties or other third parties. In times of increased economic stress, we are at an increased risk of fraud losses. We cannot assure you that our underwriting and operational controls will prevent or detect such fraud or that we will not experience fraud losses or incur costs or other damages related to such fraud. Our customers may also experience fraud in their businesses which could adversely affect their ability to repay their loans or make use of our services. Our exposure and the exposure of our customers to fraud may increase our financial risk and reputation risk as it may result in unexpected loan losses that exceed those that have been provided for in our allowance for loan losses. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading information from our customers, counterparties and other third parties, including as a result of fraud, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConsumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and other institutional customers. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or customer. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings.\nWe are subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility.\nFrom time to time, customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to our performance of our fiduciary responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal actions related to our performance of our fiduciary responsibilities are merited, defending claims is costly and diverts management\u2019s attention, and if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect our market perception and products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Any financial liability or reputational damage resulting from claims and legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nOur stock price can be volatile.\nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations, financial conditions or asset quality;\n\u2022changes in recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry, including regulatory actions against other financial institutions;\n\u2022perceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors;\n\u2022perceptions in the marketplace regarding the impact of changes in price per barrel of crude oil, real estate values and interest rates on the Texas economy;\n\u2022new technology used or services offered by competitors;\n\u2022significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;\n\u2022failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions;\n\u2022future issuances of our common stock or other securities;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022changes in government regulations; and\n\u2022geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts, health emergencies, epidemics or pandemics.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions including as a result of the economic impact of COVID-19, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.\nThe holders of our subordinated notes and junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our common stock shareholders.\nOn November 6, 2020, we issued $100.0 million of 3.875% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes, which mature in November 2030. On September 19, 2016, we issued $100.0 million of 5.50% fixed-to-floating subordinated notes, which mature in September 2026. On September 4, 2003, we issued $20.6 million of floating rate junior subordinated debentures in connection with a $20.0 million trust preferred securities issuance by our subsidiary Southside Statutory Trust III. These junior subordinated debentures mature in September 2033. On August 8 and 10, 2007, we issued $23.2 million and $12.9 million, respectively, of fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated debentures in connection with $22.5 million and $12.5 million, respectively, trust preferred securities issuances by our subsidiaries Southside Statutory Trust IV and V, respectively. Trust IV matures October 2037 and Trust V matures September 2037. On October 10, 2007, as part of an acquisition, we assumed $3.6 million of floating rate junior subordinated debentures to Magnolia Trust Company I in connection with $3.5 million of trust preferred securities issued in 2005 that mature in 2035.\nWe conditionally guarantee payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities. Our subordinated notes and the junior subordinated debentures are senior to our shares of common stock. We must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) before any dividends can be paid on our common stock, and in the event of bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of common stock. We have the right to defer distributions on our debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) for up to five years, during which time no dividends may be paid to holders of common stock.\nThe trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies.\nAlthough our common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the trading volume for our common stock is low relative to other larger financial services companies, and you are not assured liquidity with respect to transactions in our common stock. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no\ncontrol. Given the lower trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock or the expectation of these sales, could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe may issue additional securities, which could dilute your ownership percentage.\nIn certain situations, our board of directors has the authority, without any vote of our shareholders, to issue shares of our authorized but unissued stock. In the future, we may issue additional securities, through public or private offerings, to raise additional capital or finance acquisitions. Any such issuance would dilute the ownership of current holders of our common stock.\nSecurities analyst might not continue coverage on our common stock, which could adversely affect the market for our common stock.\nThe trading price of our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about us and our business. We do not have any control over these analysts and they may not continue to cover our common stock. If securities analysts do not continue to cover our common stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect its market price. If securities analysts continue to cover our common stock and our common stock is the subject of an unfavorable report, the price of our common stock may decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover us or fail to publish regular reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the price or trading volume of our common stock to decline.\nProvisions of our certificate of formation and bylaws, as well as state and federal banking regulations, could delay or prevent a takeover of us by a third party.\nOur certificate of formation and bylaws could delay, defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us, despite the possible benefit to our shareholders, or otherwise adversely affect the price of our common stock. These provisions include, among others, requiring advance notice for raising business matters or nominating directors at shareholders\u2019 meetings and staggered board elections.\nAny individual, acting alone or with other individuals, who are seeking to acquire, directly or indirectly, 10.0% or more of our outstanding common stock must comply with the CBCA, which requires prior notice to the Federal Reserve for any acquisition. Additionally, any entity that wants to acquire 5.0% or more of our outstanding common stock, or otherwise control us, may need to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHCA of 1956, as amended. As a result, prospective investors in our common stock need to be aware of and comply with those requirements, to the extent applicable. These provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control, including under circumstances in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium over the market price of our share.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit.\nOur common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result, if you acquire our common stock, you may lose some or all of your investment.", "PERMNO": 86091, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SBSI"}
