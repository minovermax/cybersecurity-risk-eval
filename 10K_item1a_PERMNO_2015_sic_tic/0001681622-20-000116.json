{"cik": "1681622", "company": "Varex Imaging Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-11-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. Although the risk factors described below are the ones management deems material, additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem not material may also adversely affect our business operations. If any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties actually occur, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur operations, cash flow, and financial position have been adversely affected, and in the future could continue to be adversely impacted, by the coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic and associated economic disruptions.\nThe pandemic caused by the spread of COVID-19 has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption.\nDecreased demand for certain products. As an initial response to the pandemic, governments around the world imposed measures designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and individuals responded to the fears of contracting COVID-19 by modifying their behavior. In particular, restrictions on the movement of people and goods were put into place, overall economic activity decreased, elective procedures and exams were delayed or cancelled, there was a significant reduction in physician office visits, and hospitals were postponing or cancelling capital purchases as well as limiting or eliminating services. Those factors, among others, caused customers to delay or cancel orders for certain Varex products. While healthcare systems and economies around the world have begun to reopen, customer demand has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, and the adverse effects of COVID-19 on our financial statements and results of operations are expected to be more persistent, and have been more severe, than previously assumed. Specifically, we now believe that reduced demand in our industrial segment and for certain higher end medical products will continue to depress our results of operations. In addition, new or continuing outbreaks of COVID-19 could lead to further decreases in demand for certain of our products. The actions taken to combat COVID-19 have had, and we believe will continue to have, a negative impact on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. We believe that COVID-19\u2019s adverse impact on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition will be primarily driven by: the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic; the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact on the U.S. and international healthcare systems, the U.S. economy and worldwide economy; and the timing, scope and effectiveness of U.S. and international governmental responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic disruptions.\nDisruption in manufacturing, distribution, supply chain and other operations. In addition to adversely affecting demand for our products, COVID-19 and associated economic disruptions have had and could continue to have an adverse impact on our manufacturing capacity, supply chains and distribution systems, including as a result of impacts associated with preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses and governments are taking. For example, at our manufacturing facility in the Philippines, many employees have had significant difficulty getting to work, which caused the facility to operate at a decreased capacity and caused us to shift some manufacturing to another location. A reduction or interruption in any of our manufacturing processes could have a material adverse effect on our business. Supply chain logistics have also become more challenging and could remain challenging and result in higher costs. Our ability to move unfinished goods and finished products around the world have been impacted by the decreased availability of global transportation networks. In addition, regulatory approvals for certain of our products may continue to be delayed due to COVID-19 related closures.\nVarex sells its products and services to a limited number of OEM customers, many of which are also its competitors, and a reduction in or loss of business of one or more of these customers may materially reduce its sales.\nVarex had one customer during fiscal year 2020 that accounted for 21% of its revenue. Varex\u2019s ten largest customers as a group accounted for approximately 52%, 51% and 49% of its revenue for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nVarex sells its products to a limited number of OEM customers, many of which are also its competitors with in-house X-ray component manufacturing operations. Although Varex seeks to broaden its customer base, it will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of major customers. Because it often takes significant time to replace lost business, it is likely that Varex\u2019s operating results would be materially and adversely affected if one or more of its major OEM customers were to cancel, delay, or reduce orders in the future.\nFurthermore, Varex generates significant accounts receivables from the sale of its products and the provision of services directly to its major customers. If one or more of these customers were to cancel a product order or service contract (whether in accordance with its terms or otherwise), become insolvent or otherwise be unable or fail to pay for Varex products and services, Varex\u2019s operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nVarex may not be able to accurately predict the demand for its products by its customers.\nEnd-user product demand, economic uncertainties, the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, and other matters beyond Varex\u2019s control make it difficult for its customers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities; which makes it difficult for Varex to accurately predict the demand for its products. Because the manufacture of our products requires some lead-time, changes in customer purchasing forecasts have previously impacted Varex\u2019s business, resulting in excess inventory and slowdowns in sales.\nSimilar inventory adjustments and slowdowns in sales are likely to occur in the future. Changes to customer forecasts can occur on short notice. Varex\u2019s customers also face inherent competitive issues and new product introduction delays which can result in changes in forecasts. The market and regulatory risks faced by Varex\u2019s customers also ultimately impact Varex\u2019s ability to forecast future business. Varex\u2019s agreements for imaging components, such as its three-year pricing agreement with Canon Medical Systems, may contain purchasing estimates that are based on its customers\u2019 historical purchasing patterns rather than firm commitments, and actual purchasing volumes under the agreements may vary significantly from these estimates. The variation from forecasted purchasing volume may be due, in part, to the increasing life of X-ray tubes, which can result in reduced demand for replacement X-ray tubes in ways Varex may not be able to accurately forecast. Reductions in purchasing patterns have in the past and may in the future materially and adversely affect Varex\u2019s operating results. Decreased economic activity associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on the demand for our industrial products and that impact is likely to continue.\nVarex competes in highly competitive markets, and it may lose business to its customers or other companies with greater resources or the ability to develop more effective technologies, or it could be forced to reduce its prices.\nRapidly-evolving technology, intense competition and pricing pressure characterize the market in which Varex competes. Varex often competes with companies that have greater financial, marketing and other resources than Varex. Some of the major diagnostic imaging systems companies, which are the primary OEM customers for Varex\u2019s X-ray components, also manufacture X-ray components, including X-ray tubes, for use in their own imaging systems products. Varex must compete with these in-house manufacturing operations for business. If these customers manufacture a greater percentage of their components in-house or otherwise decrease purchases from external sources, which may occur for a number of reasons, including a strong U.S. Dollar, or a general economic slowdown, Varex could experience reductions in purchasing volume by, or loss of, one or more of these customers. Such a reduction or loss may have a material and adverse effect on its business. In addition, Varex competes against other stand-alone, independent X-ray tube manufacturers for both the OEM business of major diagnostic imaging equipment manufacturers and the independent servicing business for X-ray tubes.\nThe market for flat panel detectors is also very competitive, and Varex faces intense competition from over a dozen smaller competitors. As a result of these competitive dynamics, to effectively retain the business of its customers and compete with its competitors Varex must have an advantage in one or more significant areas, such as lower product cost, better product quality and/or superior technology and/or performance. Varex has made price concessions to maintain existing customers and attract new customers, and may have to make additional price concessions in the future.\nIn its industrial segment, Varex competes with other OEM suppliers, primarily outside of the United States. The market for its X-ray tube and flat panel products used for nondestructive testing in industrial applications is small and highly fragmented. Some of Varex\u2019s competitors outside the United States may have resources and support from their governments that Varex does not, such as preferences for local manufacturers, and may not be subject to the same trade compliance regulations as Varex. Therefore, Varex\u2019s ability to compete in certain high-growth markets may be limited compared to its competitors.\nVarex\u2019s competitors could develop technologies and products that are more effective than those Varex currently uses or produces or that could render its products obsolete or noncompetitive. In addition, the timing of Varex\u2019s competitors\u2019 introduction of products into the market could affect the market acceptance and sales of Varex\u2019s products. Some competitors offer specialized products that provide, or may be perceived by customers to provide, an advantage over Varex\u2019s products. Also, some of Varex\u2019s non-U.S. competitors may not be subject to the same standards, regulatory and/or other legal requirements to which Varex is subject and, therefore, they could have a competitive advantage in developing, manufacturing and marketing products and services. Any inability to develop, gain regulatory approval for and supply commercial quantities of competitive products to the market as quickly and effectively as Varex\u2019s competitors could limit market acceptance of Varex\u2019s products and reduce its sales. Any of these competitive factors could negatively and materially affect Varex\u2019s pricing, sales, revenues, market share and gross margins and its ability to maintain or increase its operating margins.\nVarex\u2019s success depends on the successful development, introduction, and commercialization of new generations of products and enhancements to or simplifications of existing product lines.\nRapid change and technological innovation characterize the markets in which Varex operates, particularly with respect to flat panel technology. Varex\u2019s customers use its products in their medical diagnostic, security, and industrial imaging systems, and Varex must continually introduce new products at competitive costs while also improving existing products with higher quality, lower costs, and increased features. To be successful, Varex must anticipate its customers\u2019 needs and demands, as well as potential shifts in market preferences. Varex\u2019s failure to do so has in the past resulted, and may in the future result, in the loss of customers and an adverse\nimpact to its financial performance. With a relatively strong U.S. Dollar, Varex\u2019s ability to meet its customers\u2019 pricing expectations is particularly challenging and may result in erosion of product margin and market share.\nVarex has in the past spent, and in the future may need to spend, more time and money than it expects to develop, market and introduce new products or enhancements, and, even if Varex succeeds, Varex may not be able to recover all or a meaningful part of its investment. Once introduced, new products may materially and adversely impact sales of Varex\u2019s existing products or make them less desirable or even obsolete, which could materially and adversely impact Varex\u2019s revenues and operating results. In addition, certain costs, including installation and warranty costs, associated with new products may be proportionately greater than the costs associated with other products and may therefore disproportionately, materially, and adversely affect Varex\u2019s gross and operating margins. If Varex is unable to lower these costs over time, Varex\u2019s operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Some of the electronic components and integrated circuits used in Varex\u2019s flat panel detectors are susceptible to discontinuance and obsolescence risks, which may force Varex to incorporate newer generations of these components, resulting in unplanned additional R&D expenses, delays in the launch of new products, supply disruption, or inventory write downs.\nVarex\u2019s ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and product enhancements and simplifications, and the revenues and costs associated with these efforts, are affected by Varex\u2019s ability to, among other things:\n\u2022properly identify customer needs or long-term customer demands;\n\u2022prove the feasibility of new products;\n\u2022properly manage and control research and development costs;\n\u2022limit the time required from proof of feasibility to routine production;\n\u2022timely and efficiently comply with internal quality assurance systems and processes;\n\u2022limit the timing and cost of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022accurately predict and control costs associated with inventory overruns caused by the phase-in of new products and the phase-out of old products;\n\u2022price its products competitively and profitably, which can be particularly difficult with a strong U.S. Dollar;\n\u2022manufacture, deliver, and install its products in sufficient volumes on time and accurately predict and control costs associated with manufacturing installation, warranty, and maintenance of the products;\n\u2022appropriately manage its supply chain;\n\u2022manage customer acceptance and payment for products; and\n\u2022anticipate, respond to, and compete successfully with competitors.\nFurthermore, as discussed in greater detail elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, Varex cannot be sure that it will be able to successfully develop, manufacture, or introduce new products or enhancements, the roll-out of which involves compliance with complex quality assurance processes, including the Quality System Regulation of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). Failure to complete these processes timely and efficiently could result in delays that could affect Varex\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers or cause customers to delay or cancel orders, which would materially and adversely affect Varex\u2019s revenues and operating results.\nMore than half of Varex\u2019s revenues are generated from customers located outside the United States, and economic, political, and other risks associated with international sales and operations could materially and adversely affect Varex\u2019s sales or make them less predictable.\nVarex conducts business globally. Revenues generated from customers located outside the United States accounted for approximately 66%, 65% and 65% of Varex\u2019s total revenues during fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. As a result, Varex must provide significant service and support globally. Varex intends to continue to expand its presence in international markets and expects to expend significant resources in doing so. Varex cannot be sure that it will be able to meet its sales, service, and support objectives or obligations in these international markets or recover its investment in these international markets. Varex\u2019s future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022currency fluctuations, and in particular the strength of the U.S. Dollar (which is our functional and reporting currency) relative to many currencies, which have and may in the future adversely affect Varex\u2019s financial results and cause some customers to delay purchasing decisions or move to in-sourcing supply or migrate to lower cost alternatives or ask for additional discounts;\n\u2022the longer payment cycles associated with many customers located outside the United States;\n\u2022difficulties in interpreting or enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through many foreign countries\u2019 legal systems;\n\u2022changes in restrictions on trade between the United States and other countries or unstable regional political and economic conditions;\n\u2022changes in the political, regulatory, safety or economic conditions in a country or region\n\u2022the imposition by governments of additional taxes, tariffs, global economic sanctions programs, or other restrictions on foreign trade such as the tariffs recently put into place by both China and the United States;\n\u2022any inability to obtain required export or import licenses or approvals, including the inability to obtain required export licenses during a U.S. government shutdown;\n\u2022natural disasters and pandemics;\n\u2022failure to comply with export laws and requirements, which may result in civil or criminal penalties and restrictions on Varex\u2019s ability to export its products, particularly its industrial linear accelerator products;\n\u2022risks unique to the Chinese market, including import barriers and preferences for local manufacturers;\n\u2022failure to obtain proper business licenses or other documentation or to otherwise comply with local laws and requirements regarding marketing, sales, service, or any other business Varex conducts in a foreign jurisdiction, which may result in civil or criminal penalties and restrictions on its ability to conduct business in that jurisdiction; and\n\u2022difficulties in protecting Varex\u2019s intellectual property in foreign countries.\nAlthough Varex\u2019s sales fluctuate from period to period, in recent years Varex\u2019s international operations have represented a larger share of its business. The more Varex depends on international sales, the more vulnerable Varex becomes to these factors.\nA change in the percentage of Varex\u2019s total earnings from international sales or additional changes in tax laws could increase Varex\u2019s effective tax rate.\nVarex\u2019s effective tax rate is impacted by tax laws in both the United States and in foreign countries. Earnings from Varex\u2019s international subsidiaries are generally taxed at rates that differ from U.S. rates. A change in the percentage of Varex\u2019s total earnings from the international subsidiaries, a change in the mix of particular tax jurisdictions between the international subsidiaries, or a change in currency exchange rates could cause Varex\u2019s effective tax rate to increase. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201cU.S. Tax Reform\u201d) was signed into law on December 22, 2017. Prior to the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform, Varex was not taxed in the United States on certain undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. While U.S. Tax Reform imposed a current tax on cumulative undistributed earnings, these earnings could also become subject to incremental foreign withholding or U.S. state taxes should they be actually remitted to the United States, in which case Varex\u2019s financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe changes included in U.S. Tax Reform are broad, complex, and subject to change and interpretation. Additional statutory changes or interpretive guidance issued by Federal or local authorities could have a material impact on income tax expense, the effective rate, or the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition, significant judgments and estimates are required to evaluate our tax position and the impact of the new tax law. If these judgments and estimates are incorrect, or if the underlying assumptions are modified by subsequent guidance or are different from what we expect, our tax liability could differ significantly from our current estimates. Changes in the valuation of Varex\u2019s deferred tax assets or liabilities, additional changes in tax laws or rates, changes in the interpretation of tax laws in other jurisdictions, or other changes beyond Varex\u2019s control could materially and adversely affect its financial position and results of operations.\nVarex has entities in certain jurisdictions with cumulative net operating losses for which no income tax benefit can be recorded due to full valuation allowance positions. There could be additional future losses in these and other jurisdictions that would negatively impact Varex's effective tax rate.\nVarex may face additional risks from the acquisition or development of new lines of business.\nFrom time to time, Varex may acquire or develop new lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with new lines of business, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. Risks include developing knowledge of and experience in the new business, recruiting market professionals, increasing research and development expenditures, and developing and capitalizing on new relationships with experienced market participants. This may mean significant investment and involvement of Varex\u2019s senior management to acquire or develop, then integrate, the business into its operations. Timelines for integration of new businesses may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible, as new products can carry lower gross margins than existing products. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences may also impact whether implementation of a new business will be successful. Failure to manage these risks could have a material and adverse effect on Varex\u2019s business, results of operations, and/or financial condition.\nVarex may be unable to complete future acquisitions or realize expected benefits from acquisitions of or investments in new businesses, products, or technologies, which could harm Varex\u2019s business.\nVarex\u2019s ability to identify and take advantage of attractive acquisitions or other business development opportunities is an important component in implementing its overall business strategy. Varex must grow its businesses in response to changing technologies, customer demands, and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, Varex may decide to grow its business through the acquisition of complementary businesses, products, or technologies, rather than through internal development; however, there is no guarantee that these acquisitions will be successful or that Varex will realize a return on its investment.\nIdentifying suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time consuming, and costly, and Varex may not be able to identify suitable candidates or successfully complete or finance identified acquisitions, including as a result of failing to obtain regulatory or competition clearances, which could impair Varex\u2019s growth and ability to compete. In addition, completing an acquisition can divert Varex\u2019s management and key personnel from its current business operations, which could harm its business and affect its financial results. Even if Varex completes an acquisition, Varex may not be able to successfully integrate newly-acquired organizations, products, technologies, or employees into its operations or may not fully realize some of the expected synergies.\nIntegrating an acquisition can also be expensive and time consuming and may strain Varex\u2019s resources. It may cost Varex more to commercialize new products than originally anticipated or cause Varex to increase its expenses related to research and development, either of which could materially and adversely impact its results of operations. In many instances, integrating a new business will also involve implementing or improving internal controls appropriate for a public company into a business that lacks them. It is also possible that an acquisition could increase Varex\u2019s risk of litigation, as a third party may be more likely to assert a legal claim following an acquisition because of perceived deeper pockets or a perceived greater value of a claim. In addition, Varex may be unable to retain the employees of acquired companies or the acquired company\u2019s customers, suppliers, distributors, or other partners for a variety of reasons, including the fact that these entities may be Varex\u2019s competitors or may have close relationships with its competitors.\nFurther, Varex may find that it needs to restructure or divest acquired businesses or assets of those businesses. Even if it does so, an acquisition may not produce the full efficiencies, growth, or benefits that were expected. If Varex decides to sell assets or a business, it may be difficult to identify buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms, in a timely manner, or at all, which could delay the accomplishment of its strategic objectives. Varex may be required to dispose of a business at a lower price or on less advantageous terms, or to recognize greater losses than it had anticipated.\nIf Varex acquires a business, it allocates the total purchase price to the acquired business\u2019 tangible assets and liabilities, identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities based on their fair values as of the date of the acquisition and records the excess of the purchase price over those values as goodwill. If it fails to achieve the anticipated growth from an acquisition, or if it decides to sell assets or a business, it may be required to recognize an impairment loss on the write down of its assets and goodwill, which could materially and adversely affect its financial results. In addition, acquisitions can result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or expenses, or other charges, any of which could harm Varex\u2019s business and affect its financial results.\nAdditionally, Varex participates in joint ventures and has investments in privately-held companies (for example, its 40% ownership in dpiX LLC, its major supplier of its amorphous silicon-based thin film transistor arrays (flat panels used in its digital detectors) that are subject to risk of loss of investment capital. These investments are inherently risky, in some instances because the markets for the technologies or products these companies have under development may never materialize. If these companies do not succeed, Varex could lose some or all of its investment in these companies.\nWarranty claims may materially and adversely affect Varex\u2019s business.\nVarex could experience an increase in warranty claims as a result of issues with product quality or product failures as a direct result of Varex\u2019s design, manufacturing, or issues in its supply chain. Such an occurrence may damage Varex\u2019s market reputation, cause sales to decline, or require repairs or voluntary remedial measures to enhance customer satisfaction, which could materially and adversely impact Varex\u2019s financial results. Increased warranty claims on any given product could cause Varex to halt production on that product and significantly impair Varex\u2019s liquidity and profitability, and cause reputational harm to Varex. Because some categories of products tend to experience higher numbers of warranty claims than others, a shift in the types of products that Varex\u2019s customers purchase could lead to an increase in warranty claims. If actual levels of warranty claims are greater than the level of claims Varex estimates, cost of sales could increase, and Varex\u2019s financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, product quality issues could result in significant follow-on effects for Varex, including, among other things, reputational harm to\nVarex and its customers, loss of customers, and liability as a result of product quality issues. These outcomes would materially and adversely affect Varex\u2019s business and financial condition.\nProduct defects or misuse may result in material product liability or professional errors and omissions claims, litigation, investigation by regulatory authorities, or product recalls that could harm Varex\u2019s future revenues and require it to pay material uninsured claims.\nVarex\u2019s business exposes it to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the manufacture, sale, installation, servicing, and support of components that are used in medical devices and other devices that deliver radiation. Because Varex\u2019s products, through incorporation in OEMs\u2019 systems, are involved in the intentional delivery of radiation to the human body and other situations where people may come into contact with radiation (for example, when Varex\u2019s security and inspection products are being used to scan cargo or in the diagnosis of medical problems), the possibility for significant personal injury or loss of life exists. Although Varex\u2019s products are incorporated into OEMs\u2019 systems, and thus only perform pursuant to the design and operating systems of OEMs, Varex may also be subject to claims for property damage, personal injury, or economic loss related to or resulting from any errors or defects in its products or the installation, servicing, or support of its products. Any accident or mistreatment could subject Varex to legal costs, litigation, adverse publicity, and damage to its reputation, whether or not its products or services were a factor.\nIf Varex\u2019s X-ray inspection systems fail to detect the presence of bombs, explosives, weapons, contraband, or other threats to personal safety, Varex could be subject to product and other liability claims or negative publicity, which could result in increased costs, reduced sales, and a decline in the market price of Varex\u2019s common stock. There are many factors beyond Varex\u2019s control that could result in the failure of its products to detect the presence of bombs, explosives, weapons, contraband, or other threats to personal safety, including operator error and misuse of or malfunction of Varex equipment. The failure of Varex\u2019s systems to detect the presence of these dangerous materials may lead to personal injury, loss of life, and extensive property damage and may result in potential claims against Varex.\nProduct liability actions are subject to uncertainty and may be expensive, time consuming, and disruptive to Varex\u2019s operations. For these and other reasons, Varex may choose to settle product liability claims against it regardless of their actual merit. A product liability action determined against Varex could result in adverse publicity or significant damages, including the possibility of punitive damages, and Varex\u2019s combined financial position, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf a product Varex designs or manufactures were defective (whether due to design, labeling or manufacturing defects, improper use of the product, or other reasons), Varex may be required to correct or recall the product and notify regulatory authorities. The adverse publicity resulting from a correction or recall could damage Varex\u2019s reputation and cause customers to review and potentially terminate their relationships with Varex. A product correction or recall could consume management time and have an adverse financial impact on its business, including incurring substantial costs, losing revenues, and accruing losses.\nVarex maintains limited product liability insurance coverage. Varex\u2019s product liability insurance policies are expensive and have high deductible amounts and self-insured retentions. Varex\u2019s insurance coverage may prove to be inadequate, and future policies may not be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts, if at all. If a material claim is not insured or is in excess of Varex\u2019s insurance coverage, Varex could have to pay substantial damages, which could have a material and adverse effect on its financial position and/or results of operations.\nVarex\u2019s business may suffer if it is not able to hire and retain qualified personnel.\nVarex\u2019s future success depends, to a great degree, on its ability to retain, attract, expand, integrate, and train its management team and other key personnel, such as qualified engineering, service, sales, marketing, and other staff. Varex competes for key personnel with other medical equipment and software manufacturers and technology companies, as well as universities and research institutions. Because this competition is intense, particularly in Utah, where unemployment rates are relatively low, compensation-related costs could increase significantly if the supply of qualified personnel decreases or demand increases. If Varex is unable to hire and train qualified personnel, Varex may not be able to maintain or expand its business. Additionally, if Varex is unable to retain key personnel, Varex may not be able to replace them readily or on terms that are reasonable, which also could hurt its business.\nRisks Relating to the Manufacture of our Products\nA disruption at Varex\u2019s manufacturing facilities, as well as fluctuating manufacturing costs, could materially and adversely affect its business.\nThe majority of Varex\u2019s products are manufactured at its facility in Salt Lake City, Utah. Varex\u2019s manufacturing operations are subject to potential power failures, the breakdown, failure, or substandard performance of equipment, the improper installation or operation of equipment, pandemics, and natural or other disasters. Loss or damage to its manufacturing facility due to any of these factors or otherwise could materially and adversely affect Varex\u2019s ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of its products or otherwise deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements, which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences. Because of the time required to obtain regulatory approval and licensing of a manufacturing facility, Varex may not be available on a timely basis to replace any lost manufacturing capacity. The occurrence of these or any other operational issues at Varex\u2019s manufacturing facilities could have a material and adverse effect on Varex\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSome of Varex\u2019s products are manufactured in Wuxi, China; Walluf, Germany; Heerlen and Doetinchem, the Netherlands; and Calamba City, Philippines, which are subject to similar risks but may also face additional regulatory and political risks, which could impact Varex\u2019s ability to manufacture and ship products in a timely manner or at all. Varex also manufactures security products in Las Vegas, Nevada, and these operations are also subject to potential power failures, the breakdown, failure, or substandard performance of equipment, the improper installation or operation of equipment, earthquakes, and other disasters, all of which could materially and adversely affect Varex\u2019s ability to deliver products to meet customer demand. In addition, Varex\u2019s costs associated with manufacturing its products can vary significantly from quarter to quarter, and fluctuations thereof may adversely affect its business, operating results, and/or financial condition.\nVarex\u2019s results have been and may continue to be affected by continuing worldwide economic instability, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in the price of crude oil and other commodities.\nThe global economy has been impacted by a number of economic and political factors. In many markets, these conditions have shrunk capital equipment budgets, slowed decision-making and made it difficult for Varex\u2019s customers and vendors to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. This, in turn, has caused Varex\u2019s customers to be more cautious with, and sometimes freeze, delay, or dramatically reduce purchases and capital project expenditures. Some countries have adopted and may in the future adopt austerity or stimulus programs that could negatively affect Varex\u2019s results from period to period. In addition, actions taken by the current U.S. administration may also create global economic uncertainty, which may cause our customers to reduce their spending, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. An uncertain economic environment may also disrupt supply or affect our service business, as customers\u2019 constrained budgets may result in pricing pressure, extended warranty provisions, and even cancellation of service contracts. In addition, concerns over continued economic instability could make it more difficult for Varex to collect outstanding receivables. A weak or deteriorating healthcare market would inevitably materially and adversely affect Varex\u2019s business, financial conditions, and results of operations.\nBecause Varex\u2019s products are generally priced in U.S. Dollars, the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar in the last several years has caused, and could continue to cause, some customers to ask for discounts, delay purchasing decisions, or consider moving to in-sourcing such components or migrating to lower cost alternatives. Further, because Varex\u2019s business is global and some payments may be made in local currency, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can impact its results by affecting product demand, revenues and expenses, and/or the profitability in U.S. Dollars of products and services that Varex provides in foreign markets.\nChanges in monetary or other policies here and abroad, including as a result of economic and/or political instability or in reaction thereto, would also likely affect foreign currency exchange rates. Furthermore, if one or more European countries were to replace the Euro with another currency, Varex\u2019s sales in these countries, or in Europe generally, would likely be materially and adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established.\nAdditionally, fluctuations in commodities prices could materially and adversely affect Varex\u2019s performance. Rising commodities prices will increase Varex\u2019s costs and those of Varex\u2019s medical OEM customers, which could in turn result in reduced demand for Varex\u2019s products. Further, Varex\u2019s security product revenues from oil-producing countries, in which Varex has a significant customer base, have in the past suffered as a result of volatility in oil prices and remain sensitive to fluctuations in the future.\nThe loss of a supplier or any inability to obtain supplies of important components could restrict Varex\u2019s ability to manufacture products, cause delays in its ability to deliver products, or significantly increase its costs.\nVarex obtains from a limited group of suppliers or from sole-source suppliers some of the components included in its products, such as wave guides for industrial linear accelerators, transistor arrays, cesium iodide coatings and specialized integrated circuits for flat panel detectors, X-ray tube targets, housings, glass frames, high-voltage cable, bearings and various other components. For example, Varex\u2019s major supplier of its amorphous silicon-based thin film transistor arrays (flat panels) used in its digital image detectors is dpiX LLC. Although Varex holds a 40% ownership interest in dpiX, Varex does not have majority voting rights and does not have the power to direct the activities of dpiX. In addition, Varian is Varex\u2019s sole source supplier for a key component in linear accelerators used in Varex\u2019s security and inspection products subsystems, which are specially made for Varex. If current suppliers cease producing these components, there can be no assurance that the components will be available from other suppliers on reasonable terms or at all.\nIf Varex loses any of these limited- or sole-source suppliers, if their operations are substantially interrupted, or if any of them fail to meet performance or quality specifications or delivery deadlines, Varex may be required to obtain and qualify one or more replacement suppliers. Such an event (1) may then also require Varex to redesign or modify its products to incorporate new parts and/or further require Varex to obtain clearance, qualification, or certification of these products, including by the FDA, or obtain other applicable regulatory approvals in other countries, or (2) could significantly increase costs for the affected products and cause material delays in delivery of those and other related products. In addition, manufacturing capacity limitations of any of Varex\u2019s suppliers or other inability of these suppliers to meet increasing demand or delivery deadlines could limit growth opportunities for the affected product lines and damage customer relationships. Shortage of, and greater demand for, components and subassemblies could also increase manufacturing costs if the supply/demand imbalance increases the price of the components and subassemblies. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect Varex\u2019s business and financial results.\nA shortage or change in source of, or increase in price of, raw materials could restrict Varex\u2019s ability to manufacture products, cause delays, or significantly increase its cost of goods.\nVarex relies on the supplies of certain raw materials such as tungsten, lead, iridium, and copper for security and inspection products and copper, lead, tungsten, rhenium, molybdenum zirconium, and various high grades of steel alloy for X-ray tubes. Worldwide demand, availability, and pricing of these raw materials have been volatile, and Varex expects that availability and pricing will continue to fluctuate in the future. If supplies are restricted or become unavailable or if prices increase, this could constrain Varex\u2019s manufacturing of affected products, reduce its profit margins, or otherwise materially and adversely affect its business.\nVarex is required to disclose (1) the presence in a company\u2019s products of certain metals known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d which are metals mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries, and (2) procedures regarding a manufacturer\u2019s efforts to identify the sourcing of those minerals from this region. Varex\u2019s complex supply chain may inhibit Varex\u2019s ability to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in its products through the due diligence procedures that it implements, which may harm Varex\u2019s reputation. In addition, Varex may encounter challenges in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of Varex products are certified as conflict-free, which could place Varex at a competitive disadvantage if it is unable to do so. Moreover, complying with these rules requires investigative efforts, which has and will continue to cause Varex to incur associated costs and could materially and adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in Varex\u2019s products or result in process or manufacturing modifications, all of which could materially and adversely affect its results of operations.\nIf Varex is not able to match its manufacturing capacity with demand for its products, its financial results may suffer.\nMany of Varex\u2019s products have a long production cycle, and Varex must anticipate demand for its products to ensure adequate manufacturing or testing capacity. If Varex is unable to anticipate demand, and its manufacturing or testing capacity does not keep pace with product demand, Varex will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner, which may negatively impact its financial results and overall business. Conversely, if demand for Varex\u2019s products decreases, the fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity may harm its financial results, including by decreasing gross margins and increasing research and development costs as a percentage of revenue.\nDelivery schedules for Varex\u2019s security, industrial, and inspection products tend to be unpredictable.\nVarex designs, manufactures, sells, and services Linatron\u00ae X-ray accelerators, image-processing software, and image detection products for security and inspection, such as cargo screening at ports and borders and nondestructive examination for a variety of applications, as well as industrial applications. Varex generally sells security and inspection products to OEMs who\nincorporate its products into their inspection systems, which are then sold to customs and other government agencies, as well as to commercial organizations in the casting, power, aerospace, chemical, petro-chemical, and automotive industries. Varex believes growth in its security and inspection products will be driven by security cargo screening and border protection needs, as well as by the needs of customs agencies to verify shipments for assessing duties and taxes. This business is heavily influenced by domestic and international government policies on border and port security, political change, and government budgets. In addition, Varex believes growth in this product line may be driven in part by industrial customers engaged in 3-D printing, which, as a developing market, may be difficult to predict. Orders for Varex\u2019s security and inspection products have been and may continue to be unpredictable, as governmental agencies may place large orders with Varex or its OEM customers in a short time period and then may not place any orders for a long time period thereafter. Because it is difficult to predict Varex\u2019s OEM customer delivery, the actual timing of sales and revenue recognition varies significantly. The market for border protection systems has slowed significantly, and end customers, particularly in oil-based economies and war zones in which Varex has a significant customer base, are delaying system deployments or tenders and considering moving to alternative sources, resulting in a decline in the demand for security and inspection products.\nThe demand for Varex\u2019s security and inspection products is heavily influenced by U.S. and foreign governmental policies on national and homeland security, border protection, and customs activities, which depend upon government budgets and appropriations that are subject to economic conditions, as well as political changes and oil prices. Varex has seen customers freeze or dramatically reduce purchases and capital project expenditures, delay projects, or act cautiously as governments around the world wrestle with spending priorities. As economic growth remains sluggish in various jurisdictions and appears to be deteriorating in others, and as concerns about levels of government employment and government debt continue, Varex expects that these effects will also continue. Bid awards in this business may be subject to challenge by third parties, as Varex has previously encountered with a large government project. These factors make this business more unpredictable and could cause volatility in Varex\u2019s revenues and earnings.\nVarex\u2019s international manufacturing operations subject it to volatility and other risks, including high security risks, which could result in harm to its employees and contractors or substantial costs.\nVarex conducts certain manufacturing operations internationally to reduce costs and streamline its manufacturing operations. There are administrative, legal, and governmental risks to operating internationally that could increase operating expenses or hamper the development of these operations. The risks from operating internationally that could increase Varex\u2019s operating expenses and materially and adversely affect its operating results, financial condition, and ability to deliver its products and grow its business include, among others:\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing employee relations and foreign operations, particularly in attracting and retaining personnel qualified to design, sell, test, and support its products;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022difficulties in coordinating its operations globally and in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures, and policies across its operations;\n\u2022difficulties in enforcing contracts and protecting intellectual property;\n\u2022diversion of management attention;\n\u2022imposition of burdensome governmental regulations, including changing laws and regulations with respect to collection and maintenance of personally identifiable data;\n\u2022regional and country-specific political and economic instability, as discussed in greater detail below; and\n\u2022inadequacy of the local infrastructure to support its operations.\nVarex\u2019s international locations expose it to higher security risks compared to its United States locations, which could result in both harm to its employees and contractors or substantial costs. Some of its services are performed in or adjacent to high-risk locations where the country or location and surrounding area is suffering from political, social, or economic turmoil, war or civil unrest, or has a high level of criminal or terrorist activity. In those locations where Varex has employees or operations, Varex may incur substantial costs to maintain the safety of its personnel. Despite these precautions, the safety of its personnel in these locations may continue to be at risk, and Varex may in the future suffer the loss of employees and contractors, which could harm its business reputation and operating results.\nVarex\u2019s operations are vulnerable to interruption or loss due to natural or other disasters, power loss, strikes, and other events beyond its control.\nVarex conducts some of its activities, including manufacturing, research and development, administration, and data processing at facilities located in areas that have in the past experienced or may in the future experience natural disasters. Varex\u2019s insurance coverage for such disasters may not be adequate or continue to be available at commercially-reasonable terms, or at all. A\nmajor disaster (such as a major fire, hurricane, earthquake, flood, tsunami, volcanic eruption or terrorist attack) affecting Varex\u2019s facilities, or those of its suppliers, could significantly disrupt its operations and delay or prevent product manufacture and shipment during the time required to repair, rebuild, or replace its or its suppliers\u2019 damaged manufacturing facilities. These delays could be lengthy and costly. If any of Varex\u2019s customers\u2019 facilities are adversely affected by a disaster, shipments of its products could be delayed. Additionally, customers may delay purchases of Varex\u2019s products until its operations return to normal. For example, following the earthquake and tsunami disasters in Japan in 2011, the operations of Canon Medical Systems, our largest customer, were impacted, and, as a consequence, orders to and product shipment from our business were delayed for several months. Even if Varex's suppliers or customers are able to quickly respond to a disaster, the ongoing effects of the disaster could create some uncertainty in the operations of its business. In addition, Varex\u2019s facilities may be subject to a shortage of available electrical power and other energy supplies. Any shortages may increase its costs for power and energy supplies or could result in blackouts, which could disrupt the operations of its affected facilities and harm its business. Further, Varex\u2019s products are typically shipped from a limited number of ports, and any disaster, strike, or other event blocking shipment from these ports could delay or prevent shipments and harm its business. In addition, concerns about terrorism, the effects of a terrorist attack, political turmoil, or an outbreak of epidemic diseases could have a negative effect on Varex\u2019s business operations, those of its suppliers and customers, and the ability to travel, resulting in adverse consequences on its revenues and financial performance.\nRisks Relating to our Intellectual Property and Information Systems\nVarex\u2019s competitive position would be harmed if it is not able to maintain its intellectual property rights and protecting Varex\u2019s intellectual property can be costly.\nVarex files applications as appropriate for patents covering new products and manufacturing processes. Varex cannot be sure, however, that patents will be issued from any of Varex\u2019s pending or future patent applications. Varex also cannot be sure that its current patents, the claims allowed under its current patents, or patents for technologies licensed to Varex will be sufficiently broad to protect its technology position against competitors. Issued patents owned by, or licensed to, Varex may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or the rights granted under the patents may not provide Varex with competitive advantages. Asserting Varex\u2019s patent rights against others in litigation or other legal proceedings is costly and diverts managerial resources. For example, during fiscal year 2019, Varex initiated litigation asserting claims of patent infringement against a third party. Varex intends to prosecute its claims vigorously, and Varex has experienced, and will continue to experience, increased legal expenses related to this litigation that could adversely affect its financial results. An adverse finding in this or similar patent infringement litigation could adversely impact Varex\u2019s competitive position. In addition, Varex may not be able to detect patent infringement by others or may lose its competitive position in the market before Varex is able to do so.\nVarex also relies on a combination of copyright, trade secret, and other laws, and contractual restrictions on disclosure, copying and transferring title (including confidentiality agreements with vendors, strategic partners, co-developers, employees, consultants, and other third parties), to protect its proprietary, and other confidential rights. These protections may prove to be inadequate, since agreements may still be breached, and Varex may not have adequate remedies for a breach. Varex\u2019s trade secrets may become known to or be independently developed by others, including as a result of misappropriation by unauthorized access to Varex\u2019s technology systems. If Varex\u2019s proprietary or confidential information is misappropriated, its business and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted. Varex has trademarks, both registered and unregistered, that are maintained and enforced to provide customer recognition for its products in the marketplace, but unauthorized parties may still use them. Varex also licenses certain patented or proprietary technologies from others. In some cases, products with substantial revenues may depend on these license rights. If Varex were to lose the rights to license these technologies, or its costs to license these technologies were to materially increase, its business would suffer. As Varex expands its manufacturing capabilities outside of the United States, more of Varex\u2019s intellectual property may be held in jurisdictions that do not have robust intellectual property protections, which may make it harder for Varex to adequately protect its Intellectual Property.\nThird parties may claim that Varex is infringing upon their intellectual property, and Varex could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling its products.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation over patent and other intellectual property rights in the industries in which Varex competes. Varex\u2019s competitors, like companies in many high technology businesses, continually review other companies\u2019 activities for possible conflicts with their own intellectual property rights. In addition, non-practicing entities may review Varex\u2019s activities for conflicts with their patent rights. Determining whether a product infringes on a party\u2019s intellectual property rights involves complex legal and factual issues, and the outcome of this type of litigation is often uncertain. Parties may claim that Varex is infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Varex may not be aware of intellectual property rights of others that relate to its products, services, or technologies. From time to time, Varex has received notices from parties asserting infringement, and Varex has been subject to\nlawsuits alleging infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights. Any dispute regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and could divert Varex\u2019s management and key personnel from its business operations. Varex may not prevail in a dispute. Varex does not maintain insurance for intellectual property infringement, so costs of defense, whether or not Varex is successful in defending an infringement claim, will be borne by Varex and could be significant. If Varex is unsuccessful in defending or appealing an infringement claim, Varex may be subject to significant damages, and its combined financial position, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Varex may also be subject to injunctions against development and sale of its products, the effect of which could be to materially reduce its revenues. Furthermore, a third party claiming infringement may not be willing to license its rights to Varex, and even if a third-party rights holder is willing to do so, the amounts Varex might be required to pay under the associated royalty or license agreement could be significant. Varex could decide to alter its business strategy or voluntarily cease the allegedly infringing actions rather than face litigation or pay a royalty, which could materially and adversely impact its business and results of operations.\nDisruption of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of Varex\u2019s systems may materially and adversely affect its business and customer relations.\nInformation technology (including technology from third party providers) helps Varex operate efficiently, interface with and support its customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency, and produce its financial statements. In the ordinary course of its business, Varex collects, processes and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and that of customers, suppliers and business partners, third parties accessing its website, patient data and personally identifiable information of customers and employees, in Varex\u2019s data centers, and on its networks, as well as third party off-site infrastructure. Despite security measures, there is an increasing threat of information security attacks, including from computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, and cyber-attacks that pose risks to companies, including Varex. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently, have become increasingly sophisticated and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, Varex may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures, which could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. If Varex does not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, Varex could be subject to, among other things, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through a security breach or misappropriation of intellectual property. Such security breaches could expose Varex to a risk of loss of information, litigation, and possible liability to employees, customers, and/or regulatory authorities. If Varex\u2019s data management systems do not effectively collect, secure, store, process, and report relevant data for the operation of its business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, or human error, Varex\u2019s ability to effectively plan, forecast, and execute its business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. Any such impairment could materially and adversely affect Varex\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the timeliness with which Varex reports its operating results internally and externally.\nVarex uses certain cloud-based software. A security breach, whether of Varex\u2019s products, of Varex\u2019s customers\u2019 network security and systems, or of third-party hosting services could disrupt access to Varex\u2019s customers\u2019 stored information and could lead to the loss of, damage to or public disclosure of Varex\u2019s customers\u2019 stored information, including patient health information. Such an event could have serious negative consequences, including possible patient injury, regulatory action, fines, penalties and damages, reduced demand for Varex\u2019s solutions, an unwillingness of its customers to use its solutions, harm to its reputation and brand, and time-consuming and expensive litigation, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on Varex\u2019s financial results.\nRisks Relating to Our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nChanges in import/export regulatory regimes and tariffs could continue to negatively impact our business.\nTariffs and changes in international trade agreements or trade-related laws and regulations may have an indirect adverse impact on our business. As a component manufacturer, our products are integrated into the systems and products of our OEM customers. If the United States, China or other countries levy tariffs, duties or other additional taxes or restrictions on our customer\u2019s products, the demand for such products, and our components included in such products, could decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Uncertainty over tariffs and trade wars could also cause our customers to delay or cancel orders for our products.\nIn recent years, the United States has imposed tariffs on items imported from China that are incorporated into our products. Tariffs on items imported by us from China and other countries have increased our costs and has increased prices and lowered gross margins on some of our products. These tariffs have had a direct adverse impact on our business and results of operations, and future tariffs could have a more significant impact on our business. China has imposed retaliatory tariffs that impact a number of Varex\nproducts including U.S. origin X-ray tubes, heat exchange units, and certain flat panel detectors. The tariffs levied by China have increased our customers\u2019 costs for products imported into China, which has caused us to make price concessions on some products and has caused some customers to stop purchasing products from us. We expect that tariffs will continue to have a negative effect on our business and results of operations, including the possibility of continued price concessions or loss of business. Tariffs could limit our ability to compete for increased market share in China, which could cause our long-term prospects in China to suffer. The imposition of additional tariffs by the United States could result in the adoption of additional tariffs by China and other countries, as well as further retaliatory actions by any affected country, which could negatively impact the global market for imaging equipment and could have a significant adverse effect on our business.\nCompliance with foreign laws and regulations applicable to the marketing, manufacture, and distribution of Varex\u2019s products may be costly, and failure to comply may result in significant penalties and other harm to Varex\u2019s business.\nRegulatory requirements affecting Varex\u2019s operations and sales outside the United States vary from country to country, often differing significantly from those in the United States. In general, outside the United States, some of Varex\u2019s products are regulated as medical devices by foreign governmental agencies similar to the FDA.\nFor Varex to market its products internationally, Varex must obtain clearances or approvals for products and product modifications. These processes (including, for example, in the EU, the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), Switzerland, Brazil, Australia, China, Japan and Canada) can be time consuming, expensive and uncertain, which can delay Varex\u2019s ability to market products in those countries. Delays in the receipt of or failure to receive regulatory approvals, the inclusion of significant limitations on the indicated uses of a product, the loss of previously obtained approvals or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could restrict or prevent Varex from doing business in a country or subject Varex to a variety of enforcement actions and civil or criminal penalties, which would materially and materially and adversely affect its business. In addition, compliance with changing regulatory schemes may add additional complexity, cost and delays in marketing or selling Varex\u2019s products.\nWithin the EU/EEA, Varex must obtain, and in turn affix, a CE mark certification, which is a European marking of conformity that indicates that a product meets the essential requirements of the Medical Device Directive. Compliance with the Medical Device Directive is done through a self-certification process that is then verified by an independent certification body called a \u201cNotified Body,\u201d which is an organization empowered by the legislature to conduct this verification. Once the CE mark is affixed, the Notified Body will regularly audit Varex to ensure that it remains in compliance with the applicable European laws and Medical Device Directive. By affixing the CE mark to its product, Varex is certifying that its products comply with the laws and regulations required by the EU/EEA countries, thereby allowing the free movement of its products within these countries and others that accept CE mark standards. If Varex cannot support its performance claims and demonstrate compliance with the applicable European laws and the Medical Device Directive, Varex would lose its right to affix the CE mark to its products, which would prevent Varex from selling its products within the EU/EEA/Switzerland territory and in other countries that recognize the CE mark. In April 2017, the European Commission adopted two new regulations on medical devices. These new regulations impose stricter requirements for placing medical devices in the EU market, as well as for Notified Bodies. These new regulations have resulted in the limited availability of recognized Notified Bodies, which could delay our ability to obtaining CE marks. Varex may be subject to risks associated with additional testing, modification, certification, or amendment of its existing market authorizations, or Varex may be required to modify products already installed at its customers\u2019 facilities to comply with the official interpretations of these revised regulations.\nVarex is also subject to international laws and regulations of general applicability relating to matters such as environmental protection, safe working conditions, and manufacturing practices, as well as others. These are often comparable to, if not more stringent than, the equivalent regulations in the United States. Sales overseas are also affected by regulation of matters such as product standards, packaging, labeling, environmental and product recycling requirements, import and export restrictions, tariffs, duties, and taxes.\nIn addition, Varex is required to timely file various reports with international regulatory authorities similar to the reports it is required to timely file with U.S. regulatory authorities, including reports required by international adverse event reporting regulations. If these reports are not timely filed, regulators may impose sanctions, including temporarily suspending Varex\u2019s market authorizations or CE mark, and sales of its products may suffer.\nFurther, as Varex enters new businesses or pursues new business opportunities internationally, or as regulatory schemes change, Varex may become subject to additional laws, rules, and regulations. Becoming familiar with and implementing the infrastructure necessary to comply with these laws, rules, and regulations is costly. Additionally, in some countries, Varex relies or may rely in the future on foreign distributors and agents to assist in complying with foreign regulatory requirements, and Varex cannot\nbe sure that they will always do so. The failure of Varex or its agents to comply with these laws, rules, and regulations could delay the introduction of new products, cause reputational harm, or result in investigations, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, criminal prosecution, or an inability to sell Varex\u2019s products in or to import its products into certain countries, which could materially and adversely affect Varex\u2019s business.\nCompliance with U.S. laws and regulations applicable to the marketing, manufacture, and distribution of Varex\u2019s products may be costly, and failure or delays in obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals or failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could prevent Varex from distributing its products, require Varex to recall its products, or result in significant penalties or other harm to Varex\u2019s business.\nSome of Varex\u2019s products and those of OEMs that incorporate Varex\u2019s products are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation in the United States. Compliance with these laws and regulations is expensive and time-consuming, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect Varex\u2019s business.\nGenerally, Varex\u2019s manufacturing operations for medical devices, and those of its third-party manufacturers, are required to comply with the Quality System Regulations (\u201cQSR\u201d) of the FDA, as well as other federal and state regulations for medical devices and radiation-emitting products. The FDA makes announced and unannounced periodic and on-going inspections of medical device manufacturers to determine compliance with QSR and, in connection with these inspections, issues reports known as Form FDA 483 reports when the FDA believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures. If observations from the FDA issued on Form FDA 483 reports are not addressed and/or corrective action is not taken in a timely manner and to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction, the FDA may issue a warning letter and/or proceed directly to other forms of enforcement action. Similarly, if a warning letter were issued, prompt corrective action to come into compliance would be required. Failure to respond in a timely manner to Form FDA 483 observations, a warning letter, or any other notice of noncompliance and to promptly come into compliance could result in the FDA bringing an enforcement action, which could include the total shutdown of Varex\u2019s production facilities, denial of importation rights to the United States for products manufactured in overseas locations, adverse publicity, and criminal and civil fines. The expense and costs of any corrective actions that Varex may take, which may include product recalls, correction and removal of products from customer sites, and/or changes to its product manufacturing and quality systems, could materially and adversely impact Varex\u2019s financial results and may also divert management resources, attention, and time. Additionally, if a warning letter were issued, customers could delay purchasing decisions or cancel orders, and Varex could face increased pressure from its competitors, who could use the warning letter against Varex in competitive sales situations, either of which could materially and adversely affect Varex\u2019s reputation, business, and stock price.\nIn addition, Varex is required to timely file various reports with the FDA, including reports required by the medical device reporting regulations (\u201cMDRs\u201d), that require Varex report to regulatory authorities if its devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. If Varex initiates a correction or removal of a device to reduce a risk to health posed by the device, Varex would be required to submit a publicly-available correction and removal report to the FDA and, in many cases, similar reports to other regulatory agencies. This report could be classified by the FDA as a device recall, which could lead to increased scrutiny by the FDA, other international regulatory agencies, and Varex\u2019s customers regarding the quality and safety of Varex\u2019s devices. If these MDRs or correction and removal reports are not filed on a timely basis, regulators may impose sanctions, sales of Varex\u2019s products may suffer, and Varex may be subject to product liability or regulatory enforcement actions, all of which could harm its business.\nGovernment regulation may also cause significant delays or even prevent the marketing and full commercialization of future products or services that Varex may develop and/or may impose costly requirements on Varex\u2019s business. Further, as Varex enters new businesses or pursues new business opportunities, Varex will become subject to additional laws, rules, and regulations, including FDA and foreign rules and regulations. Becoming familiar with and implementing the infrastructure necessary to comply with these laws, rules, and regulations is costly and time consuming. In addition, failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations could delay the introduction of new products and could materially and adversely affect Varex\u2019s business.\nIf Varex or any of its suppliers, distributors, agents, or customers fail to comply with FDA, Federal Trade Commission, or other applicable U.S. regulatory requirements or are perceived to have failed to comply with regulations, Varex may face:\n\u2022adverse publicity affecting both Varex and its customers;\n\u2022increased pressures from competitors;\n\u2022investigations by governmental authorities;\n\u2022fines, injunctions, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution;\n\u2022partial suspension or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions;\n\u2022increased difficulty in obtaining required clearances or approvals or losses of clearances or approvals already granted;\n\u2022seizures or recalls of Varex products or those of its customers;\n\u2022delays in purchasing decisions by customers or cancellation of existing orders;\n\u2022the inability to sell Varex products; and\n\u2022difficulty in obtaining product liability or operating insurance at a reasonable cost, or at all.\nVarex is also subject to federal and state laws and regulations of general applicability relating to matters such as environmental protection, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, and other matters. Insurance coverage is not commercially available for violations of law, including the fines, penalties, or investigatory costs that Varex may incur as the consequence of regulatory violations. Consequently, Varex does not have insurance that would cover this type of liability.\nVarex sells certain X-ray tube products as replacements which are subject to medical device certification and product registration laws and regulations, which vary by country and are subject to change, and Varex may be unable to receive registration approval or renewal of existing registrations if it fails to meet regulatory approval requirements or if the approval process becomes commercially infeasible or impractical.\nVarex markets and distributes certain X-ray tubes through distributors and third-party/multi-vendor service organizations that are used as equivalent replacements for specific OEM tubes. Varex is subject to medical device certification and product registration laws, which vary by country and are subject to periodic reviews and changes by regulatory authorities in those countries. For example, to sell X-ray tubes for replacement applications in China, product registrations must be approved by the new National Medical Products Administration (\u201cNMPA\u201d). Varex must comply with the requirements of the NMPA, and Varex may not be able to receive registration approval or renewal of existing registrations if it fails to meet regulatory approval requirements or if the process of gaining approval becomes commercially infeasible or impractical. Certain of these local laws and regulations have the effect of serving as a barrier to trade and can be difficult to navigate predictably.\nIn addition, certain countries in which Varex products are sold require products to undergo re-registration if the product is altered in any significant way, and it may be determined that the separation of Varex from Varian, including Varex\u2019s new name, will require these products to be re-registered as Varex products, even if they are physically unchanged.\nThese registration processes can be costly and time consuming, and customers may decide to purchase products from Varex\u2019s competitors that do not have to be involved in a re-registration process. In addition, Varex\u2019s inability to receive or renew product registrations may prevent Varex from marketing and/or distributing those particular products for replacement applications in the specific country.\nExisting and future healthcare reforms, including the Affordable Care Act and changes to reimbursement rates, may indirectly have a material adverse effect on Varex\u2019s business and results of operations.\nSales of Varex\u2019s products to OEMs in the medical sector indirectly depend on whether adequate reimbursement is available for its customers\u2019 products from a variety of sources, such as government healthcare insurance programs, including U.S. Medicare and Medicaid programs, foreign government programs, private insurance plans, health maintenance organizations, and preferred provider organizations. Without adequate reimbursement, the demand for Varex\u2019s customers\u2019 products, and therefore indirectly Varex\u2019s products, may be limited.\nHealthcare reform proposals and medical cost containment measures in the United States and in many foreign countries could limit the use of both Varex\u2019s and its customers\u2019 products, reduce reimbursement available for such use, further tax the sale or use of Varex\u2019s products, and further increase the administrative and financial burden of compliance. These reforms and measures, including the uncertainty in the medical community regarding their nature and effect, could have a material and adverse effect on Varex\u2019s and its customers\u2019 purchasing decisions regarding its products and treatments and could harm Varex\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. Varex cannot predict the specific healthcare programs and regulations that will be ultimately implemented by local, regional, and national governments globally. However, any changes that lower reimbursements for Varex\u2019s or its customers\u2019 products and/or procedures using these products, including, for example, existing reimbursement incentives to convert from analog to digital X-ray systems, or changes that reduce medical procedure volumes or increase cost containment pressures on Varex or others in the healthcare sector could materially and adversely affect Varex\u2019s business and results of operations.\nVarex is subject to federal, state, and foreign laws governing its business practices which, if violated, could result in substantial penalties. Additionally, challenges to or investigations into Varex\u2019s practices could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to and thus could harm its business.\nAnti-corruption laws and regulations. Varex is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-corruption laws, as well as similar laws in foreign countries, such as the U.K. Bribery Act and the Law On the Fundamentals of Health Protection in the Russian Federation. In general, there is a worldwide trend to strengthen anti-corruption laws and their enforcement, and the healthcare industry and medical equipment manufacturers have been particular targets of these investigation and enforcement efforts. Any violation of these laws by Varex or its agents or distributors could create substantial liability for Varex, subject its officers and directors to personal liability, and cause a loss of reputation in the market. Varex operates in many countries, including India and China, where the public sector is perceived as being corrupt. Varex\u2019s strategic business plans include expanding its business in regions and countries that are rated as higher risk for corruption activity by Transparency International e.V., an international non-profit that publishes an annual corruption perception index. Becoming familiar with and implementing the infrastructure necessary to comply with laws, rules, and regulations applicable to new business activities and mitigating and protecting against corruption risks could be costly. Failure by Varex or its agents or distributors to comply with these laws, rules, and regulations could delay its expansion into high-growth markets and could materially and adversely affect its business. Varex will likely do more business, directly and potentially indirectly, in countries where the public sector is perceived to be corrupt. Increased business in higher-risk countries could subject Varex and its officers and directors to increased scrutiny and increased liability from its business operations.\nCompetition and trade compliance laws. Varex is subject to various competition and trade compliance laws in the jurisdictions where it operates. Regulatory authorities in those jurisdictions may have the power to subject Varex to sanctions and impose changes or conditions in the way Varex conducts its business. An increasing number of jurisdictions provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct and seek damages. Increased government scrutiny of Varex\u2019s actions or enforcement or private rights of action could materially and adversely affect its business or damage its reputation. Varex may be required to conduct internal investigations or face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies, which could be costly and time consuming and could divert its management and key personnel from its business operations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject Varex to fines and/or or criminal or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect Varex\u2019s business and financial results. Furthermore, competition laws may prohibit or increase the cost of future acquisitions that Varex may desire to undertake.\nLaws and ethical rules governing interactions with healthcare providers. Varex does not generally sell its products directly to healthcare providers, but may occasionally sell its products to healthcare providers through distributors. The U.S. Medicare and Medicaid \u201canti-kickback\u201d laws, and similar state laws, prohibit payments or other remuneration that is intended to induce hospitals, physicians, or others either to refer patients or to purchase, lease, or order, or to arrange for or recommend the purchase, lease, or order of healthcare products or services for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. These laws affect Varex\u2019s sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements Varex may have with hospitals, physicians, or other potential purchasers of its products. They particularly impact how Varex structures its sales offerings, including discount practices, customer support, education and training programs, physician consulting, research grants, and other fee-for-service arrangements. These laws are broadly written, and it is often difficult to determine precisely how these laws will be applied to specific circumstances.\nFederal and state \u201cfalse claims\u201d laws generally prohibit knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government payors that are false or fraudulent, or for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Although Varex does not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be, and have been, held liable under these laws if they are deemed to \u201ccause\u201d the submission of false or fraudulent claims by providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or through certain other activities, including promoting products for uses not approved or cleared by the FDA, which is called off-label promotion. Violating \u201canti-kickback\u201d and \u201cfalse claims\u201d laws can result in civil and criminal penalties, which can be substantial, as well as potential mandatory or discretionary exclusion from healthcare programs for noncompliance. Even an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into Varex\u2019s practices could cause adverse publicity and be costly to defend and thus could harm its business and results of operations. Additionally, several recently-enacted state and federal laws, including laws in Massachusetts and Vermont, and the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, now require, among other things, extensive tracking and maintenance of databases regarding the disclosure of equity ownership and payments to physicians, healthcare providers, and hospitals. These laws may require Varex to implement the necessary and costly infrastructure to track and report certain payments to healthcare providers. Failure to comply with these new tracking and reporting laws could subject Varex to significant civil monetary penalties.\nVarex is subject to similar laws in foreign countries where it conducts business. For example, within the EU, the control of unlawful marketing activities is a matter of national law in each of the member states. The member states of the EU closely monitor perceived unlawful marketing activity by companies. Varex could face civil, criminal, and administrative sanctions if any member state determines that Varex has breached its obligations under such state\u2019s national laws. Industry associations also closely monitor the activities of member companies. If these organizations or authorities name Varex as having breached its obligations under their regulations, rules, or standards, its reputation would suffer, and its business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nCertain of Varex\u2019s products are subject to regulations relating to use of radioactive material, compliance with which may be costly, and a failure to comply therewith may materially and adversely affect Varex\u2019s business.\nAs a manufacturer and seller of medical devices and devices emitting radiation or utilizing radioactive by-product material, Varex and some of its suppliers and distributors are subject to extensive regulation by United States governmental authorities, such as the FDA, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (\u201cNRC\u201d), and state and local regulatory agencies, which is intended to ensure the devices are safe and effective and comply with laws governing products which emit, produce, or control radiation. These regulations govern, among other things, the design, development, testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, import/export, sale, and marketing and disposal of Varex\u2019s products. Varex is also subject to international laws and regulations that apply to manufacturers of radiation-emitting devices and products utilizing radioactive materials. These are often comparable to, if not more stringent than, the equivalent regulations in the United States.\nVarex\u2019s industrial and medical devices utilizing radioactive material are subject to NRC clearance and approval requirements, and the manufacture and sale of these products are subject to extensive federal and state regulation that varies from state to state and among regions. Varex\u2019s manufacture, distribution, installation, service, and removal of industrial devices utilizing radioactive material or emitting radiation also requires Varex to obtain a number of licenses and certifications for these devices and materials. Service of these products must also be in accordance with a specific radioactive materials licenses. Obtaining licenses and certifications may be time consuming, expensive, and uncertain.\nThe handling and disposal of radioactive materials resulting from the manufacture, use, or disposal of Varex\u2019s products may impose significant costs and requirements. Disposal sites for the lawful disposal of materials generated by the manufacture, use, or decommissioning of Varex\u2019s products may no longer accept these substances in the future or may accept them on unfavorable terms.\nIf Varex is unable to obtain required FDA clearances or approvals for a product or is unduly delayed in doing so, or the uses of that product were limited, Varex\u2019s business could suffer.\nTypically, Varex\u2019s OEM customers are responsible for obtaining 510(k) pre-market notification clearance on their systems that integrate Varex products. A substantial majority of Varex\u2019s products are \u201cClass I\u201d devices that do not require 510(k) clearance, but Varex does produce software that is classified as a Class II device subject to 510(k) clearance. Unless an exception applies, Varex may be required by FDA regulations to obtain a 510(k) pre-market notification clearance in connection with the manufacture of a new medical device or a new indication for use of, or other significant change in, an existing currently marketed medical device before it can market or sell those products in the United States. Modifications or enhancements to a product that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the device, technology, materials, labeling, packaging, or manufacturing process also require a new 510(k) clearance. Although manufacturers make the initial determination whether a change to a cleared device requires a new 510(k) clearance, Varex cannot ensure that the FDA will agree with its decisions not to seek additional approvals or clearances for particular modifications to its products or that Varex will be successful in obtaining new 510(k) clearances for modifications. Obtaining clearances or approvals is time consuming, expensive, and uncertain. Varex may not be able to obtain the necessary clearances or approvals or may be unduly delayed in doing so, which could harm its business. Furthermore, even if Varex is granted regulatory clearances or approvals, they may include significant limitations on the indicated uses of the product, which may limit the market for the product. If Varex is unable to obtain required FDA clearance or approval for a product or is unduly delayed in doing so, or the uses of that product were limited, Varex\u2019s business could suffer.\nUnfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially and adversely affect Varex\u2019s financial results.\nFrom time to time, Varex is a party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings, claims, government inspections, audits or investigations, and other legal matters, both inside and outside the United States, arising in the ordinary course of its business or otherwise. Legal proceedings are often lengthy, taking place over a period of years with interim motions or judgments subject to multiple levels of review (such as appeals or rehearings) before the outcome is final. Litigation and other legal proceedings, claims, government inspections, audits and investigations are subject to significant uncertainty and may be expensive, time consuming, and\ndisruptive to Varex\u2019s operations. For these and other reasons, Varex may choose to settle legal proceedings and claims, regardless of their actual merit.\nIf a legal proceeding were ultimately resolved against Varex, it could result in significant compensatory damages, and, in certain circumstances, punitive damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures, or injunctive relief imposed on Varex. If Varex\u2019s existing insurance does not cover the amount or types of damages awarded, or if other resolution or actions taken as a result of such legal proceeding were to restrain its ability to market one or more of its material products or services, its combined financial position, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, legal proceedings, and any adverse resolution thereof, can result in adverse publicity and damage to Varex\u2019s reputation, which could materially and adversely impact its business.\nNew accounting pronouncements or changes in interpretation or application of generally accepted accounting principles may materially and adversely affect Varex\u2019s operating results.\nVarex prepares its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the FASB, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC, and various other regulatory and/or accounting bodies. New accounting pronouncements, or a change in interpretations of, or its application of, existing principles can have a significant effect on Varex\u2019s reported results and may even affect its reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced. In addition, when Varex is required to adopt new accounting standards, Varex\u2019s methods of accounting for certain items may change, which could cause its results of operations to fluctuate from period to period, make it more difficult to compare its financial results to prior periods, and could cause Varex to delay required filings under the Exchange Act.\nAs its operations evolve over time, Varex may introduce new products and/or new technologies that require Varex to apply different accounting principles, including ones regarding revenue recognition, than Varex has applied in past periods. The application of different types of accounting principles and related potential changes may make it more difficult to compare its financial results from quarter to quarter, and the trading price of Varex common stock could suffer or become more volatile as a result.\nEnvironmental laws impose compliance costs on Varex\u2019s business and may also result in liability.\nVarex is subject to environmental laws around the world. These laws regulate many aspects of its operations, including its handling, storage, transport, and disposal of hazardous substances, such as the chemicals and materials that Varex uses in the course of its manufacturing operations. They can also impose cleanup liabilities, including with respect to discontinued operations. As a consequence, Varex can incur significant environmental costs and liabilities, some recurring and others not recurring. Although it follows procedures intended to comply with existing environmental laws, Varex, like other businesses, may mishandle or inadequately manage hazardous substances used in its manufacturing operations and can never completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from certain materials that it uses in its business and, therefore, it cannot completely eliminate the prospect of resulting claims and damage payments. Varex may also be assessed fines and/or other penalties for failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Insurance has provided coverage for portions of cleanup costs resulting from historical occurrences, but Varex does not expect to maintain insurance coverage for costs or claims that might result from any future contamination.\nFuture changes in environmental laws could also increase its costs of doing business, perhaps significantly. Several countries, including some in the EU, now require medical equipment manufacturers to bear certain disposal costs of products at the end of the product\u2019s useful life, increasing its costs. The EU has also adopted directives that may lead to restrictions on the use of certain hazardous substances or other regulated substances in some of its products sold there. These directives, along with another that requires substance information to be provided upon request, could increase Varex\u2019s operating costs in order to maintain its access to certain markets. All of these costs, and any future violations or liabilities under environmental laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nFulfilling obligations incidental to being a public company place significant demands on Varex\u2019s management, administrative, and operational resources, including accounting and information technology resources.\nAs a public company, Varex is subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and is required to prepare its financial statements according to the rules and regulations required by the SEC. The Exchange Act requires that Varex file annual, quarterly, and current reports. Varex\u2019s failure to prepare and disclose this information in a timely manner or to otherwise comply with applicable law could subject it to penalties under federal securities laws, cause it to be out of compliance with applicable stock exchange listing requirements, and expose it to lawsuits and restrict its ability to access financing. For example, as a result of the delayed filing of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we received a notification letter from Nasdaq\nadvising us that we were not in compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements. While we promptly regained compliance with the Nasdaq listing requirements, if we had failed to regain compliance in a timely manner, it would have negatively impacted Varex.\nVarex must, among other things, establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and disclosure purposes. Internal control over financial reporting is complex and may be revised over time to adapt to changes in Varex\u2019s business or changes in applicable accounting rules. As described in the following risk factor, Varex has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. Varex cannot assure that its internal control over financial reporting will be effective in the future or that additional material weaknesses will not be discovered with respect to a prior period for which it had previously believed that internal controls were effective.\nMatters impacting Varex\u2019s internal controls may cause Varex to be unable to report its financial information on a timely basis or may cause Varex to restate previously-issued financial information, thereby subjecting Varex to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions or investigations by the SEC or in respect of violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in Varex and the reliability of its financial statements, which could affect Varex\u2019s stock price.\nVarex identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting which, if not remediated appropriately or timely, could result in loss of investor confidence and adversely impact our stock price.\nAs further described in Item 9A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2020, management determined that Varex\u2019s internal control over financial reporting and its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective and that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified material weaknesses within our risk assessment process and control environment, which in turn, contributed to additional material weaknesses related to (1) inventory and cost of sales, and (2) financial reporting. Until remediated, these material weaknesses could result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. There can be no assurance that the remedial measures being implemented by Varex's management will be successful. In addition, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, a larger number of Varex\u2019s employees are working remotely, which may make it harder to remediate existing material weaknesses and might make it harder to maintain proper internal controls over financial reporting. If Varex is unable to remediate the material weaknesses, or is otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, Varex's ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within required time periods, could be adversely affected, which could subject Varex to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, including civil penalties, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nVarex has significant debt obligations that could adversely affect its business, profitability and ability to meet its obligations.\nAs of October 2, 2020, Varex\u2019s total combined indebtedness was approximately $511.3 million. The borrowings under Varex\u2019s unsecured convertible senior notes due 2025 (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d) bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.00% and borrowings under Varex\u2019s senior secured notes due 2027 (the \u201cSenior Secured Notes\u201d) bear interest at a fixed rate of 7.875%.\nVarex's debt could potentially have important consequences to Varex and its investors, including:\n\u2022limiting Varex\u2019s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry; and\n\u2022limiting Varex\u2019s ability to borrow additional funds as needed or increasing the costs of any such borrowing.\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations, including our debt obligations;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and general industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, because a portion of our borrowings are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less debt; and\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing due to applicable financial and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.\nIf Varex\u2019s cash requirements in the future are greater than expected, its cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and Varex may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance Varex\u2019s debt. For example, holders of the Convertible Notes will have the right to require Varex to repurchase all or a portion of the Convertible Notes on the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. Further, if a make-whole fundamental change as defined in the Indenture governing the Convertible Notes occurs prior to the maturity date of the Convertible Notes, Varex will in some cases be required to increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its Convertible Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. On the conversion of the Convertible Notes, unless Varex elects to deliver solely shares of common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), Varex will be required to make cash payments for the Convertible Notes being converted. However, Varex may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time Varex is required to make such repurchases of the Convertible Notes surrendered or pay cash with respect to the Convertible Notes being converted.\nDespite our substantial indebtedness, we may still be able to incur significantly more debt. This could intensify the risks described above.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial indebtedness in the future. As of October 2, 2020, we had approximately $100 million of additional available borrowing capacity (subject to borrowing base availability) under the new revolving credit agreement that we entered into on September 30, 2020 (the \u201cAsset-Based Loan\u201d, or \"ABL Facility\"). In addition to any amounts that might be available to us for borrowing under the ABL Facility, subject to certain conditions, we will have the right to request an increase of aggregate commitments under the ABL Facility by an aggregate amount of up to $75 million by obtaining additional commitments either from one or more of the lenders under the ABL Facility or other lending institutions.\nAlthough the ABL Facility and the indenture governing our Senior Secured Notes contain restrictions on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Furthermore, the covenants in the indenture governing our Convertible Notes do not restrict the incurrence of indebtedness by the company or any of its subsidiaries, and the covenants that may be contained in any future debt instruments could allow us to incur a significant amount of additional indebtedness.\nThe more leveraged we become, the more we, and in turn holders of our notes, will be exposed to certain risks described above under \u201c- Varex has significant debt obligations that could adversely affect its business, profitability and ability to meet its obligations.\u201d\nThe ABL Facility and the indenture governing our Senior Secured Notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions that may limit our current and future operating flexibility, particularly our ability to respond to changes in the economy or our industry or to take certain actions, which could harm our long term interests and may limit our ability to make payments on the notes.\nOur ABL Facility and the indenture governing our Senior Secured Notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us.\nThese restrictions limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness (including guarantees thereof);\n\u2022pay dividends or certain other distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock or prepay subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities;\n\u2022incur liens on assets;\n\u2022make certain loans, investments or other restricted payments;\n\u2022allow to exist certain restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us;\n\u2022engage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022alter the business that we conduct; and\n\u2022sell certain assets or merge or consolidate with or into other companies.\nAs a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022limited in how we conduct our business;\n\u2022unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u2022unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nA breach of the covenants under the indenture governing our Senior Secured Notes or the ABL Facility could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default, if not cured or waived, may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt that is subject to an applicable cross-acceleration or cross-default provision. In addition, an event of default under the ABL Facility would permit the lenders under the ABL Facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the ABL Facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the ABL Facility, those lenders could proceed against the collateral securing such indebtedness. In the event our lenders or holders of the notes offered hereby accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness.\nOur ability to continue to have the necessary liquidity to operate our business may be adversely impacted by a number of factors, including uncertain conditions in the credit and financial markets, which could limit the availability and increase the cost of financing. A deterioration of our results of operations and cash flow resulting from decreases in consumer spending, could, among other things, impact our ability to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio contained in our ABL Facility.\nOur historical sources of liquidity to fund ongoing cash requirements include cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, borrowings through our previous credit facility and convertible debt offerings. The sufficiency and availability of credit may be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, the tightening of the credit markets, including lending by financial institutions who are sources of credit for our borrowing and liquidity; an increase in the cost of capital; the reduced availability of credit; our ability to execute our strategy; the level of our cash flows, which will be impacted by customer demand for our products; compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio that is included in our ABL Facility, interest rate fluctuations and the adverse impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the U.S. and world-wide economies and on our business. Interest rates in the U.S. generally increased in fiscal 2018 and 2019, but decreased in fiscal 2020. We cannot predict the future level of interest rates or the effect of any increase in interest rates on the availability or aggregate cost of our borrowings. We cannot be certain that any additional required financing, whether debt or equity, will be available in amounts needed or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nThe ABL Facility contains a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.00 to 1.00 that is tested when excess availability under the ABL is less than the greater of (i) 10.0% of the Line Cap (the lesser of (a) the aggregate commitments under the ABL Facility and (b) the aggregate borrowing base) and (ii) $7.5 million. If we have to borrow in excess of 10.0% of the Line Cap and $7.5 million, and we do not increase our earnings, we also would be at risk of not being in compliance with the ABL Facility\u2019s fixed charge coverage ratio. Compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio is dependent on the results of our operations, which are subject to a number of factors including current economic conditions. Adverse developments in the economy, including as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, could lead to reduced spending by our customers and end-users which could adversely impact our net sales and cash flow, which could affect our ability to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, the ABL Facility contains other affirmative and negative covenants that restrict Varex\u2019s operating and financing activities. These provisions may limit our ability to, among other things, incur future indebtedness, contingent obligations or liens, guarantee indebtedness, make certain investments and capital expenditures, sell stock or assets, pay dividends and consummate certain mergers or acquisitions. Failure to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio and other covenants, including the requirement to timely deliver financial statements within applicable grace periods, could result in an event of default. Upon an event of default, if the ABL Facility is not amended or the event of default is not waived, the lender could declare all amounts then outstanding, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this happens, Varex may not be able to make those payments or borrow sufficient funds from alternative sources to make those payments. Even if Varex were to obtain additional financing, that financing may be on unfavorable terms.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the notes. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Any future refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest\nrates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations. Additionally, the Indenture will limit the use of the proceeds from any disposition of our assets. As a result, the Indenture may prevent us from using the proceeds from such dispositions to satisfy our debt service obligations.\nOur credit rating and ability to access well-functioning capital markets are important to our ability to secure future debt financing on acceptable terms. Our credit ratings may not reflect all risks associated with an investment in our secured notes.\nOur access to the debt markets and the terms of such access depend on multiple factors including the condition of the debt capital markets, our operating performance and our credit ratings. These ratings are based on a number of factors including an assessment of our financial strength and financial policies. Our borrowing costs will be dependent to some extent on the rating assigned to our debt. However, there can be no assurance that any particular rating assigned to us will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. Incurrence of additional debt by us could adversely affect our credit rating. Any disruptions or turmoil in the capital markets or any downgrade of our credit rating could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, downgrading the credit rating of our debt securities or placing us on a watch list for possible future downgrading would likely have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nVarex entered into certain hedging positions that may affect the value of the Convertible Notes and the volatility and value of Varex\u2019s common stock.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, Varex entered into certain convertible note hedge transactions. These hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution of our common stock on any conversion of the Convertible Notes or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of such converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction or offset subject to a cap. The counterparties to these hedging positions or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to Varex\u2019s common stock or purchasing or selling Varex\u2019s common stock in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of Convertible Notes or following any repurchase of Convertible Notes by Varex on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise). This activity could cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of Varex common stock or the Convertible Notes. In addition, if any such hedging positions fail to become effective, the counterparties to these hedging positions or their respective affiliates may unwind their hedge positions, which could adversely affect the value of Varex common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of Varex\u2019s common stock may decline or fluctuate significantly and fluctuations in Varex\u2019s operating results, including quarterly revenues, and margins, may cause its stock price to be volatile, which could cause losses for its stockholders.\nIn the past year, Varex's stock price has ranged from a low of $10.37 to a high of $33.00. Varex cannot guarantee that an active trading market will be sustained for its common stock. Nor can Varex predict the prices at which shares of its common stock may trade. Varex has experienced and expects in the future to experience fluctuations in its operating results, including revenues and margins, from period to period. These fluctuations may cause Varex\u2019s stock price to be volatile, which could cause losses for its stockholders.\nVarex\u2019s quarterly and annual operating results, including its revenues and margins, may be affected by a number of other factors, including:\n\u2022the introduction and timing of announcement of new products or product enhancements by Varex and its competitors;\n\u2022change in its or its competitors\u2019 pricing or discount levels;\n\u2022changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other economic uncertainty;\n\u2022changes in import/export regulatory regimes including the imposition of tariffs on our products or those of our customers;\n\u2022changes in the relative portion of its revenues represented by its various products, including the relative mix between higher margin and lower-margin products;\n\u2022the ability to identify and remediate significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal controls;\n\u2022changes in the relative portion of its revenues represented by its international region as a whole and by regions within the overall region, as well as by individual countries (notably, those in emerging markets);\n\u2022fluctuation in its effective tax rate, which may or may not be known to Varex in advance;\n\u2022the availability of economic stimulus packages or other government funding, or reductions thereof;\n\u2022disruptions in the supply or changes in the costs of raw materials, labor, product components or transportation services;\n\u2022changes to its organizational structure, which may result in restructuring or other charges;\n\u2022disruptions in its operations, including its ability to manufacture products, caused by events such as earthquakes, fires, floods, terrorist attacks or the outbreak of epidemic diseases;\n\u2022the unfavorable outcome of any litigation or administrative proceeding or inquiry, including governmental audits, as well as ongoing costs associated with legal proceedings and governmental audits; and\n\u2022accounting changes and adoption of new accounting pronouncements.\nBecause many of Varex\u2019s operating expenses are based on anticipated capacity levels, and a high percentage of these expenses are fixed for the short term, a small variation in the timing of revenue recognition can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter. If Varex\u2019s gross margins fall below the expectation of securities analysts and investors, the trading price of Varex common stock may decline.\nConversion of the Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interest of Varex\u2019s stockholders or may otherwise depress the market price of Varex\u2019s common stock.\nThe conversion of the Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interests of Varex\u2019s stockholders. On conversion of the Convertible Notes, Varex has the option to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of common stock. If Varex elects to settle our conversion obligation in shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, any sales of Varex common stock issuable on such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of Varex\u2019s common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Convertible Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Convertible Notes into shares of Varex\u2019s common stock, any of which could depress the market price of Varex\u2019s common stock.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditions for optional conversion of the Convertible Notes by holders are met before the close of business on the business day immediately preceding June 1, 2025, holders of the Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If Varex elects to satisfy our conversion obligation by settling all or a portion of its conversion obligation in cash, it could adversely affect Varex\u2019s liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Convertible Notes, Varex could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of Varex net working capital and may seriously harm Varex\u2019s business.\nCertain provisions in Varex\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, its Amended and Restated Bylaws, its Indenture, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of Varex, which could decrease the trading price of Varex\u2019s common stock.\nVarex\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with Varex\u2019s board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:\n\u2022the inability of Varex\u2019s stockholders to call a special meeting;\n\u2022the inability of Varex\u2019s stockholders to act without a meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022the right of Varex\u2019s board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022the division of Varex\u2019s board of directors into three classes of directors, with each class serving a staggered three-year term, and this classified board provision could have the effect of making the replacement of incumbent directors more time-consuming and difficult, until the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, after which directors will be elected annually;\n\u2022a provision that stockholders may only remove directors with cause while the board is classified;\n\u2022the ability of Varex\u2019s directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies on Varex\u2019s board of directors; and,\n\u2022the requirement that the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least 66 2/3% of Varex\u2019s voting stock is required to amend certain provisions in Varex\u2019s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (relating to the term and removal of its directors, the filling of its board vacancies, the calling of special meetings of stockholders, stockholder action by written\nconsent, the elimination of liability of directors to the extent permitted by Delaware law and indemnification of directors and officers), although this requirement will expire on the completion of the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, after which Varex's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation may be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding voting stock.\nIn addition, because Varex did not elect to be exempt from Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), this provision could also delay or prevent a change of control that stockholders may favor. Section 203 provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or who are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation (an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d) shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation, or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which the person became an interested stockholder, unless: (1) prior to such time, the board of directors of such corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder; (2) upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of such corporation at the time the transaction commenced; or (3) on or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors of such corporation and authorized at a meeting of stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation not owned by the interested stockholder.\nThese provisions are not intended to make Varex immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that Varex\u2019s board of directors determines is not in the best interests of Varex and Varex\u2019s stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\nFurthermore, certain provisions in Varex\u2019s Indenture governing the Convertible Notes may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire Varex. For example, the Indenture requires Varex, at the holders\u2019 election, to repurchase the Convertible Notes for cash on the occurrence of a fundamental change and, in certain circumstances, to increase the conversion rate for a holder that converts its Convertible Notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change. A takeover of Varex may trigger the requirement that we repurchase the Convertible Notes or increase the conversion rate, which could make it costlier for a third party to acquire Varex. Varex\u2019s Indenture also prohibits Varex from engaging in a merger or acquisition unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes the obligations under the Convertible Notes and Varex\u2019s Indenture. These and other provisions in Varex\u2019s Indenture could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring Varex even when the acquisition may be favorable to holders of the Convertible Notes or Varex\u2019s stockholders.\nLiabilities related to Varex\u2019s operations when it was part of Varian, or liabilities associated with its spin-off from Varian, could materially and adversely affect Varex\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nVarex entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement when it spun off from Varian. The agreement provides for, among other things, indemnification obligations designed to make Varian financially responsible for liabilities allocable to Varian before the spin-off, and to make Varex financially responsible for liabilities allocable to Varex before the spin-off and for information contained in the Varex registration statement that describes the separation, Varex, and the transactions contemplated by the Separation and Distribution Agreement. Varex may be subject to substantial liabilities if it required to indemnify Varian or if Varian is required, but unable, to indemnify Varex. Either of these could negatively affect Varex\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows.", "PERMNO": 16543, "SIC": 3844, "TIC": "VREX"}
