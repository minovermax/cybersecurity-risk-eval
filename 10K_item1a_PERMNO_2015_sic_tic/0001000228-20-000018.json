{"cik": "1000228", "company": "HENRY SCHEIN INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and/or the trading price of our common stock. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, they may include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material to our operations. You should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties. The order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority.\nThe health care products distribution industry is highly competitive and consolidating, and we may not be able to compete successfully.\nWe compete with numerous companies, including several major manufacturers and distributors. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do, which could allow them to compete more successfully. Most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors. Competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products, which we would then be unable to market. Manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to end-users and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and the roles of other distributors. Industry consolidation among health care product distributors, price competition, the unavailability of products, whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in supply from manufacturers, or the emergence of new competitors, also could increase competition. There has also been increasing consolidation among manufacturers of health care products which could have a material adverse effect on our margins and product availability. Additionally, in this competitive market, some of our contracts contain minimum purchase commitments. We could be subject to charges and financial losses in the event we fail to satisfy minimum purchase commitments. In the future, we may be unable to compete successfully and competitive pressures may reduce our revenues and profitability.\nWe may experience competition from third-party online commerce sites.\nTraditional health care supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions. The continued advancement of online commerce by third parties will require us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to differentiate our business (including with additional value-added services) to address changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis. The emergence of such potential competition and our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBecause substantially all of the products that we distribute are not manufactured by us, we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products.\nWe obtain substantially all of our products from third parties. Generally, we do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us. Therefore, suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request. While there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products we sell, some key suppliers, in the aggregate, supply a significant portion of the products we sell. Additionally, because we generally do not control the actual production of the products we sell, we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control, including the failure to comply with applicable government requirements. The failure of manufacturers of products regulated by the FDA or other governmental agencies to meet these requirements could result in product recall, cessation of sales or other market disruptions. In the event that any of our third-party suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in our required volumes, we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis. There is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis, if at all. An extended interruption in the supply of our products, especially any high sales volume product, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, which most likely would adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nOur revenues and profitability depend on our relationships with capable sales personnel as well as customers, suppliers and manufacturers of the products that we distribute.\nOur future revenues and profitability depend on our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with qualified sales personnel as well as customers, suppliers and manufacturers. If we fail to maintain our existing relationships with such persons or fail to acquire relationships with such key persons in the future, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nOur future success is substantially dependent upon our senior management.\nOur future success is substantially dependent upon the efforts and abilities of members of our existing senior management, particularly Stanley M. Bergman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services of Mr. Bergman could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have an employment agreement with Mr. Bergman. We do not currently have \u201ckey man\u201d life insurance policies on any of our employees. Competition for senior management is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key personnel.\nWe experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations. Revenues and profitability generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products (including influenza vaccine, equipment and software products), purchasing patterns of office-based health care practitioners and year-end promotions. Revenues and profitability generally have been lower in the first quarter, primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters. We expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future. Quarterly results may also be materially adversely affected by a variety of other factors, including:\n\u2022 timing and amount of sales and marketing expenditures;\n\u2022 timing of pricing changes offered by our suppliers;\n\u2022 timing of the introduction of new products and services by our suppliers;\n\u2022 timing of the release of upgrades and enhancements to our technology-related products and services;\n\u2022 changes in or availability of supplier contracts or rebate programs;\n\u2022 supplier rebates based upon attaining certain growth goals;\n\u2022 changes in the way suppliers introduce or deliver products to market;\n\u2022 costs of developing new applications and services;\n\u2022 our ability to correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;\n\u2022 uncertainties regarding potential significant breaches of data security or disruptions of our information technology systems;\n\u2022 unexpected regulatory actions, or government regulation generally;\n\u2022 exclusivity requirements with certain suppliers, which may prohibit us from distributing competitive products manufactured by other suppliers;\n\u2022 loss of sales representatives;\n\u2022 costs related to acquisitions and/or integrations of technologies or businesses;\n\u2022 costs associated with our self-insured medical and dental insurance programs;\n\u2022 general market and economic conditions, as well as those specific to the health care industry and related industries;\n\u2022 our success in establishing or maintaining business relationships;\n\u2022 unexpected difficulties in developing and manufacturing products;\n\u2022 product demand and availability, or product recalls by manufacturers;\n\u2022 exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury;\n\u2022 increases in shipping costs or service issues with our third-party shippers;\n\u2022 fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies;\n\u2022 restructuring costs;\n\u2022 the adoption or repeal of legislation;\n\u2022 changes in accounting principles; and\n\u2022 litigation or regulatory judgments, expenses or settlements.\nAny change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly financial results to fluctuate. If our financial results do not meet market expectations, our stock price may decline.\nExpansion of group purchasing organizations (\u201cGPO\u201d) or provider networks and the multi-tiered costing structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe medical products industry is subject to a multi-tiered costing structure, which can vary by manufacturer and/or product. Under this structure, certain institutions can obtain more favorable prices for medical products than we are able to obtain. The multi-tiered costing structure continues to expand as many large integrated health care providers and others with significant purchasing power, such as GPOs, demand more favorable pricing terms. Additionally, the formation of provider networks and GPOs may shift purchasing decisions to entities or persons with whom we do not have a historical relationship. This may threaten our ability to compete effectively, which could in turn negatively impact our financial results. Although we are seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers to obtain access to lower prices demanded by GPO contracts or other contracts, and to develop relationships with provider networks and new GPOs, we cannot assure that such terms will be obtained or contracts will be executed.\nIncreases in shipping costs or service issues with our third-party shippers could harm our business.\nShipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business. We ship almost all of our orders through third-party delivery services, and typically bear the cost of shipment. Accordingly, any significant increase in shipping rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. Similarly, strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers could cause our operating expenses to rise and materially adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis.\nUncertain global macro-economic and political conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nUncertain global macro-economic and political conditions that affect the economy and the economic outlook of the United States, Europe and other parts of the world could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. These uncertainties, include, among other things:\n\u2022 the United Kingdom\u2019s vote to leave the European Union (generally referred to as Brexit) and any other similar referenda or actions by other European Union member countries (during 2019, approximately 3% of our consolidated net sales were invoiced to customers in the United Kingdom and approximately 20% of our consolidated net sales were invoiced to customers in Europe overall, including the U.K.);\n\u2022 election results;\n\u2022 changes to laws and policies governing foreign trade (including, without limitation, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and other international trade agreements);\n\u2022 greater restrictions on imports and exports;\n\u2022 changes in laws and policies governing health care or data privacy;\n\u2022 tariffs and sanctions;\n\u2022 sovereign debt levels;\n\u2022 the inability of political institutions to effectively resolve actual or perceived economic, currency or budgetary crises or issues;\n\u2022 consumer confidence;\n\u2022 unemployment levels (and a corresponding increase in the uninsured and underinsured population);\n\u2022 changes in regulatory and tax regulations, including, without limitation, the Tax Act;\n\u2022 increases in interest rates;\n\u2022 availability of capital;\n\u2022 increases in fuel and energy costs;\n\u2022 the effect of inflation on our ability to procure products and our ability to increase prices over time;\n\u2022 changes in tax rates and the availability of certain tax deductions;\n\u2022 increases in health care costs;\n\u2022 the threat or outbreak of war, terrorism or public unrest; and\n\u2022 changes in laws and policies governing manufacturing, development and investment in territories and countries where we do business.\nAdditionally, changes in government, government debt and/or budget crises may lead to reductions in government spending in certain countries, which could reduce overall health care spending, and/or higher income or corporate taxes, which could depress spending overall.\nRecessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending may also cause customers to reduce, modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may cause suppliers to reduce their output or change their terms of sale. We generally sell products to customers with payment terms. If customers\u2019 cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorate, or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment to us. Likewise, for similar reasons suppliers may restrict credit or impose different payment terms. Any inability of current and/or potential customers to pay us for our products and/or services or any demands by suppliers for different payment terms may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDisruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Disruptions in the financial markets may materially adversely affect the availability and cost of credit to us.\nThe market price for our common stock may be highly volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock may be highly volatile. A variety of factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 the publication of earnings estimates or other research reports and speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022 changes in our industry and competitors;\n\u2022 changes in government or legislation;\n\u2022 our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and prospects;\n\u2022 stock repurchases;\n\u2022 any future issuances of our common stock, which may include primary offerings for cash, stock splits, issuances in connection with business acquisitions, issuances of restricted stock/units and the grant or exercise of stock options from time to time;\n\u2022 general market and economic conditions; and\n\u2022 any outbreak or escalation of hostilities in areas where we do business.\nIn addition, the Nasdaq Stock Market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that can be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies listed on Nasdaq. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action or derivative litigation has often been instituted against companies. This type of litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe health care industry is experiencing changes that could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe health care industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences. In recent years, the health care industry has undergone, and is in the process of undergoing, significant changes driven by various efforts to reduce costs, including, among other things: trends toward managed care; consolidation\nof health care distribution companies; consolidation of health care manufacturers; collective purchasing arrangements and consolidation among office-based health care practitioners; and changes in reimbursements to customers, as well as growing enforcement activities (and related monetary recoveries) by governmental officials. Both our profitability and the profitability of our customers may be materially adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and/or medical treatments or services, or changes to the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined. If we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the health care industry, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nThe implementation of the Health Care Reform Law could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe Health Care Reform Law increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce Medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally, to reduce fraud and abuse, and to provide access to increased health coverage.\nThe Health Care Reform Law contained many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of Medicare and Medicaid, which included a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that was to begin in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics. The fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics was implemented in 2011, and may adversely affect sales and cost of goods sold. However, subsequent federal laws had suspended the imposition of the medical device excise tax through December 31, 2019, and the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, signed into law on December 20, 2019, has permanently repealed the medical device excise tax. The Health Care Reform Law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the United States with health insurance.\nThe Health Care Reform Law has faced ongoing legal challenges, including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented.\nIn addition, the President is seeking to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Law. Repeal and replace legislation has been passed in the House of Representatives, but did not obtain the necessary votes in the Senate. Subsequently, the President has affirmed his intention to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Law and has taken a number of administrative actions to materially weaken it, including, without limitation, by permitting the use of less robust plans with lower coverage and eliminating \u201cpremium support\u201d for insurers providing policies under the Health Care Reform Law. On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the Tax Act, which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates, international tax provisions, income tax add-back provisions and deductions and which also repealed the individual mandate of the Health Care Reform Law. Further, in December 2019, the Fifth Circuit ruled that the mandate within the Health Care Reform Law requiring that people buy health insurance was unconstitutional, though the ruling will likely be appealed. The Fifth Circuit remanded the remainder of the case, pertaining to the viability of the Health Care Reform Law, in the absence of the individual mandate, to the District Court of the Northern District of Texas. Any outcome of these cases that changes the Health Care Reform Law could have a significant impact on the U.S. health care industry. The uncertain status of the Health Care Reform Law affects our ability to plan.\nRecently, there has been increased scrutiny on drug pricing and concurrent efforts to control or reduce drug costs by Congress, the President, and various states, including that several related bills have been introduced at the federal level. Such legislation, if enacted, could have the potential to impose additional costs on our business.\nThe implementation of the reporting and disclosure obligations of the Physician Payment Sunshine Act provisions of the Health Care Reform Law could adversely affect our business.\nA Health Care Reform Law provision, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, or Open Payments Program, imposes annual reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers and distributors with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain covered recipients (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals), and for such manufacturers and distributors and for group purchasing organizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity. CMS publishes\ninformation from these reports on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and physician, dentist and teaching hospital identities. Amendments expanded the law to also require reporting, effective January 1, 2022, of payments or other transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives, and this new requirement will be effective for data collected beginning in calendar year 2021.\nUnder the Physician Payment Sunshine Act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with covered recipients such as physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals. We believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable Physician Payment Sunshine Act requirements. The Physician Payment Sunshine Act pre-empts similar state reporting laws, although we or our subsidiaries may be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and some of these state laws, as well as the federal law, can be ambiguous. We are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers. While we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these requirements, our compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on us.\nFailure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur business is subject to requirements under various local, state, federal and international laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and human cells, tissue and cellular and tissue-based products, also known as HCT/P products, and animal feed and supplements. Among the federal laws with which we must comply are the Controlled Substances Act, the FDC Act, as amended, and Section 361 of the Public Health Services Act. Among other things, such laws, and the regulations promulgated thereunder:\n\u2022 regulate the storage and distribution, labeling, packaging, handling, reporting, record keeping, introduction, manufacturing and marketing of drugs, HCT/P products and medical devices;\n\u2022 subject us to inspection by the FDA and the DEA;\n\u2022 regulate the storage, transportation and disposal of certain of our products that are considered hazardous materials;\n\u2022 require us to advertise and promote our drugs and devices in accordance with applicable FDA requirements;\n\u2022 require registration with the FDA and the DEA and various state agencies;\n\u2022 require record keeping and documentation of transactions involving drug products;\n\u2022 require us to design and operate a system to identify and report suspicious orders of controlled substances to the DEA;\n\u2022 require us to manage returns of products that have been recalled and subject us to inspection of our recall procedures and activities; and\n\u2022 impose reporting requirements if a pharmaceutical, HCT/P product or medical device causes serious illness, injury or death.\nApplicable federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations also may require us to meet various standards relating to, among other things, licensure or registration, sales and marketing practices, product integrity and supply tracking to the manufacturer of the product, personnel, privacy and security of health or other personal information, installation, maintenance and repair of equipment, and the importation and exportation of products. Our business is also subject to requirements of similar and other foreign governmental laws and regulations affecting our operations\nabroad. The FDA and DEA have recently increased their regulatory and enforcement activities, and in particular, the DEA has increased generally its regulatory and enforcement activities due to the widely reported opioid crisis in the United States.\nThe failure to comply with any of these regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or the imposition of any additional laws and regulations, could materially adversely affect our business. There can be no assurance that current and future government regulations will not adversely affect our business. The costs to us associated with complying with the various applicable statutes and regulations, as they now exist and as they may be modified, could be material. Allegations by a governmental body that we have not complied with these laws could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. While we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable laws and regulations, and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, if it is determined that we have not complied with these laws, we are potentially subject to penalties, including warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, mandatory recall of product, seizure of product and injunction, consent decrees and suspension or limitation of product sale and distribution. If we enter into settlement agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance, we could be required to make settlement payments or be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including fines and the loss of licenses. Non-compliance with government requirements could adversely affect our ability to participate in federal and state government health care programs and damage our reputation.\nThe EU Medical Device Regulation may adversely affect our business.\nAs of May 26, 2020, the European Union Medical Device Regulation No. 2017/745 (the \u201cEU MDR\u201d) applies to medical devices developed and/or commercialized in the European Union. The EU MDR is anticipated to have a major impact on the medical device industry as a whole. It may adversely affect our business in various ways.\nFirst, to the extent new products require a conformity assessment and such conformity assessment requires involvement of a notified body, the current and persisting significant shortage of notified bodies may limit our options to seek certification and/or significantly delay certification. Furthermore the (few) existing notified bodies designated under the EU MDR are experiencing significant capacity bottlenecks, which leads to above-average timelines for product certifications. The same applies to timelines for recertification of our existing products for which the CE certificate is approaching expiry. This may result in us not being able to launch or to continue commercializing products.\nFurthermore, within the context of conformity assessment (both for self-certified devices, and for devices under conformity assessment with a notified body), the EU MDR is tightening the requirements for clinical evaluation of a device. In the specific case of Class I products, where to date the legal manufacturer confirmed compliance with the regulatory requirements, oversight by supervisory authorities is expected to increase, and such authorities may have a stricter view. It may be that, from a perspective of the legal manufacturer, or of an authority, the existing product documentation has to be expanded, which may require additional development work. We may also have to decide to discontinue commercialization of certain products, if and to the extent investments into additional development are not commensurate with the business contribution of such products.\nAdditionally in the context of conformity assessment, certain national authorities as well as the European Commission have further scrutinized the business model of own brand labeling (private label products) under the EU MDR, i.e., the reliance of a manufacturer distributing a product under its name on an assessment of a supplier confirming that the product meets the regulatory requirements, including its technical file(s) for the supplied product. While this question remains under intense discussion between the industry and the authorities, and while we are exploring all options, this may require us to adapt the supply chain structure (e.g., by switching suppliers or moving to a distribution business model under which the supplier of a product is labeled as the legal manufacturer), for certain of our products, and may make it more difficult to bring private label products to market in Europe. We may not be able to continue commercializing products, if no alternative supply chain solution is found.\nIn addition, the EU MDR is imposing more stringent regulatory requirements across the whole value chain including post marketing requirements, additional requirements for the organization of the quality management\nsystem such as a responsible person for regulatory compliance, post marketing safety reporting, the requirement of Unique Device Identification (UDI), and the input into a European Databank on Medical Devices (EUDAMED, which however is delayed in its operations, with unknown implications on the regulatory obligations for product owners and distributors). Also, the regulatory requirements for our interactions with suppliers and distributors alike are tightened. These additional regulatory requirements increase our compliance obligations and thus the risk for non-compliance and greater costs.\nThe uncertain impact of the new EU MDR regulations, as well as failure to comply with the EU MDR, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud or other laws and regulations, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nCertain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar foreign) health care fraud and abuse, referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations. Some of these laws, referred to as \u201cfalse claims laws,\u201d prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payers and programs. Other laws, referred to as \u201canti-kickback laws,\u201d prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for, or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing of, items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs. Health care fraud measures may implicate, for example, our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, our pricing and incentive programs for physician and dental practices, and our dental and physician practice management products that offer billing related functionality.\nThe fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations, as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of \u201crelators\u201d who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states) under federal and state false claims laws, and who may receive up to 30% of total government recoveries. Penalties under fraud and abuse laws may be severe. For example, under the federal False Claims Act, violations may result in treble damages, plus civil penalties of up to $22,927 per claim, as well as exclusion from federal health care programs and criminal penalties. Most states have adopted similar state false claims laws, and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal False Claims Act penalties. With respect to \u201canti-kickback laws,\u201d violations of, for example, the federal Anti-Kickback Law may result in civil penalties of up to $100,522 for each violation, plus up to three times the total amount of remuneration offered, paid, solicited or received, as well as exclusion from federal health care programs and criminal penalties. Notably, effective October 24, 2018, a new federal anti-kickback law (the \u201cEliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018\u201d) enacted in connection with broader addiction services legislation, may impose criminal penalties for kickbacks involving clinical laboratory services, regardless of whether the services at issue involved addiction services, and regardless of whether the services were reimbursed by a federal health care program or by a commercial health insurer. Furthermore, the Health Care Reform Law significantly strengthened the federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Law provisions, clarifying that a federal Anti-Kickback Law violation can be a basis for federal False Claims Act liability.\nWith respect to measures of this type, the United States government (among others) has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other. As a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance.\nWe also are subject to certain United States and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, German anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years. Our businesses are generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial results, including, without limitation,\nsecurities, antitrust and marketing laws and regulations. Failure to comply with laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations and other laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Also, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses. Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs. In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities, increasing the risk of non-compliance. We may determine to enter into settlements, make payments, agree to consent decrees or enter into other arrangements to resolve such matters. For example, one of our subsidiaries resolved an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission related to the manner in which it advertised certain data security features of its dental practice management software, which resulted in a consent order and fine. Failure to comply with consent decrees could materially adversely affect our business.\nWhile we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse and other laws and regulations, and believe we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the confidentiality of sensitive personal information or standards in electronic health records or transmissions, we could be required to make significant changes to our products, or incur substantial fines, penalties or other liabilities.\nThe FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software and digital health products intended for use in health care settings. The Cures Act, signed into law on December 13, 2016, among other things amended the medical device definition to exclude certain software from FDA regulation, including clinical decision support software that meet certain criteria. On September 27, 2019, the FDA issued a suite of guidance documents on digital health products, which incorporated applicable Cures Act standards, including regarding the types of clinical decision support tools and other software that are exempt from regulations by the FDA as medical devices. Certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management, and it is possible that the FDA or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is subject to regulation as a medical device, which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products.\nOur businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health, clinical, financial and other sensitive information of individuals. These information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and malicious attack, which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns, and could involve claims against us by private parties and/or governmental agencies. For example, we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information, such as HIPAA. HIPAA requires, among other things, the implementation of various recordkeeping, operational, notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information, limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to breach of contract claims, substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation. Also, evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information, or could require us to incur significant additional costs to re-design our products in a timely manner to reflect these legal requirements, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOther health information standards, such as regulations under HIPAA, establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic transactions, such as transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers. Certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet these requirements. Failure to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims, substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.\nIn addition, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have adopted the GDPR, effective from May 25, 2018, which increased privacy rights for individuals in Europe (\u201cData Subjects\u201d), including individuals who are our customers, suppliers and employees. The GDPR extended the scope or responsibilities for data controllers and data processors and generally imposes increased requirements and potential penalties on companies, such as us, that offer goods or services to Data Subjects or monitor their behavior (including by companies based outside of Europe). Noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of EUR 20 million, or 4% of global company revenues. Individual member states may impose additional requirements and penalties regarding certain matters, such as employee personal data. With respect to the personal data it protects, the GDPR requires, among other things, company accountability, consents from Data Subjects or other acceptable legal basis to process the personal data, breach notifications within 72 hours, data integrity and security, and fairness and transparency regarding the storage, use or other processing of the personal data. The GDPR also provides rights to Data Subjects relating to modification, erasure and transporting of the personal data. In the United States, the CCPA, which increases the privacy protections afforded California residents and was signed into law on June 28, 2018, became effective January 1, 2020. The CCPA generally requires companies, such as us, to institute additional protections regarding the collection, use and disclosure of certain personal information of California residents. The California Attorney General released proposed CCPA regulations on October 10, 2019, and is required to adopt final regulations on or before July 1, 2020. In addition to providing for enforcement by the California Attorney General, the CCPA also provides for a private right of action. Entities in violation of the CCPA may be liable for civil penalties. Other states, as well as the federal government, have increasingly considered the adoption of similarly expansive personal privacy laws, backed by significant civil penalties for non-compliance. While we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the GDPR and CCPA requirements, our compliance with these measures is likely to impose additional costs on us, and we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements, or changes in our practices in response to new requirements or interpretations of the requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe also sell products and services that health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, use to store and manage patient medical or dental records. These customers and we, are subject to laws, regulations and industry standards, such as HIPAA and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which require the protection of the privacy and security of those records, and our products or services may also be used as part of these customers\u2019 comprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable legal or contractual data privacy and security laws. Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products or services to comply with applicable legal or contractual data privacy and security requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation.\nVarious federal initiatives involve the adoption and use by health care providers of certain electronic health care records systems and processes. The initiatives include, among others, programs that incentivize physicians and dentists, though Medicare\u2019s MIPS, to use certified EHR technology in accordance with certain evolving requirements, including regarding quality, promoting interoperability, cost and improvement activities. Qualification for the MIPS incentive payments requires the use of EHRs that are certified as having certain capabilities designated in standards adopted by CMS and by the ONC. These standards have been subject to change.\nCertain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified EHR systems and other products linked to MIPS and other incentive programs. In order to maintain certification of our EHR products, we must satisfy the\nchanging governmental standards. If any of our EHR systems do not meet these standards, yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive federal incentive payments, as noted above, we are exposed to risk, such as under federal health care fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act. For example, on May 31, 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice announced a $155 million settlement and 5-year corporate integrity agreement involving a vendor of certified EHR systems, based on allegations that the vendor, by misrepresenting capabilities to the certifying body, caused its health care provider customers to submit false Medicare and Medicaid claims for meaningful use incentive payments in violation of the False Claims Act. While we believe we are substantially in compliance with such certifications and with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations and we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, in order to satisfy our customers, our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex reporting functionality. Although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this, the effort may involve increased costs, and our failure to implement product modifications, or otherwise satisfy applicable standards, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAdditionally, as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology, the ability of these connected systems safely and effectively to exchange and use exchanged information becomes increasingly important. For example, on September 6, 2017, the FDA issued final guidance to assist industry in identifying specific considerations related to the ability of electronic medical devices to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged information. As a medical device manufacturer, we must manage risks including those associated with an electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device.\nThere may be additional legislative or regulatory initiatives in the future impacting health care.\nOur global operations are subject to inherent risks that could materially adversely affect our business.\nGlobal operations are subject to risks that may materially adversely affect our business. The risks that our global operations are subject to include, among other things:\n\u2022 difficulties and costs relating to staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022 difficulties in establishing channels of distribution;\n\u2022 fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies (including, without limitation, in connection with Brexit);\n\u2022 longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022 repatriation of cash from our foreign operations to the United States;\n\u2022 regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 anti-bribery, anti-corruption and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records;\n\u2022 unexpected difficulties in importing or exporting our products;\n\u2022 imposition of import/export tariffs, quotas, sanctions or penalties;\n\u2022 difficulties and delays inherent in sourcing products and contract manufacturing in foreign markets;\n\u2022 limitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property;\n\u2022 unexpected regulatory, legal, economic and political changes in foreign markets;\n\u2022 changes in tax regulations that influence purchases of capital equipment;\n\u2022 civil disturbances, geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war or political or military coups; and\n\u2022 public health emergencies, including the Coronavirus (as defined below).\nThe coronavirus could materially adversely affect our results\nThe Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (\u201cCoronavirus\u201d) is impacting worldwide economic activity, and activity in China in particular. Estimates for Chinese gross domestic product and economic growth have been reduced as a result of the coronavirus. The Company has several businesses in China that were forced to close as a result of the coronavirus for certain periods, with a corresponding effect on their sales activity. In addition, it is unclear if the coronavirus will spread to other countries, and how economic activity might be impacted on a worldwide basis. The Company also might be unable to obtain infection control products from its suppliers due to the additional demand for such products created by the virus. The impact of the virus on Chinese and other economic activity, and its effect on the supply chain are uncertain at this time and could have a material adverse effect on our results.\nWe operate within the European Union, including in the United Kingdom, and therefore may be affected by the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union.\nWe operate within the European Union, including the United Kingdom, and as a result, we face risks associated with the potential uncertainty and disruptions that may lead up to and follow Brexit, including with respect to volatility in exchange rates and interest rates and potential material changes to the regulatory regime applicable to our operations in the U.K. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global political institutions, regulatory agencies and financial markets. During 2019, approximately 3% of our consolidated net sales were invoiced to customers in the United Kingdom and approximately 20% of our consolidated net sales were invoiced to customers in Europe overall, including the U.K. There is significant uncertainty about the terms and timing under which the U.K. will continue a relationship with the EU. It is possible that Brexit will result in our U.K. and EU operations becoming subject to materially different, and potentially conflicting, laws, regulations or tariffs which could require costly new compliance initiatives or changes to legal entity structures or operating practices. Furthermore, in the event the U.K. and the EU do not reach a trade agreement during a prescribed transition period, there may be additional adverse impacts on immigration and trade between the U.K. and the EU or countries outside the EU. Such impacts could materially adversely affect our business. The ultimate effects of Brexit on us will depend on the specific terms of any agreement the U.K. and the EU reach to provide access to each other\u2019s respective markets.\nOur expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks.\nWe have expanded our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures, and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future. Such transactions involve numerous risks, including possible material adverse effects on our financial results or the market price of our common stock. Some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may also give rise to an obligation by us to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations, which payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, integrating acquired businesses and joint ventures:\n\u2022 may result in a loss of customers or product lines of the acquired businesses or joint ventures;\n\u2022 requires significant management attention;\n\u2022 may place significant demands on our operations, information systems and financial resources; and\n\u2022 results in additional acquisition and integration expenses.\nThere can be no assurance that our future acquisitions or joint ventures will be successful. Our ability to continue to successfully effect acquisitions and joint ventures will depend upon the following:\n\u2022 the availability of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates at acceptable prices;\n\u2022 our ability to consummate such transactions, which could potentially be prohibited due to U.S. or foreign antitrust regulations;\n\u2022 the availability of financing on acceptable terms, in the case of non-stock transactions;\n\u2022 the liquidity of our investments and our ability to raise capital could be affected by the financial credit markets; and\n\u2022 our ability to retain, recruit and incentivize the management of the companies we acquire.\nOur acquisitions may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect.\nWe are in the process of integrating companies that we acquired and including the operations, services, products and personnel of each company within our management policies, procedures and strategies. We cannot be sure that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or that we will not incur unforeseen additional costs or expenses in connection with these acquisitions. To effectively manage our expected future growth, we must continue to manage successfully our integration of these companies and continue to improve our operational systems, internal procedures, working capital management and financial and operational controls. If we fail in any of these areas, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nIf the Animal Health Spin-off or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Animal Health Spin-off are determined to be taxable in whole or in part, we and our stockholders may incur substantial tax liabilities.\nIn connection with the Animal Health Spin-off, we obtained an opinion of outside tax counsel that the Animal Health Spin-off will qualify as a tax-free transaction to us and our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We have not sought or obtained a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) on the tax consequences of the transaction. In addition, the tax opinion is subject to customary qualifications and assumptions, and is based on factual representations and undertakings. The failure of any factual representation or assumption to be true, correct and complete in all material respects, or any undertakings to be fully complied with, could affect the validity of the tax opinion. Moreover, an opinion of counsel represents counsel\u2019s best legal judgment, is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the IRS or the courts may not agree with the conclusions set forth in the tax opinion. Even if the Animal Health Spin-off otherwise qualified as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it may become taxable to us if certain events occur that affect either us or Covetrus. While Covetrus has agreed not to take certain actions that could cause the transaction not to qualify as a tax-free transaction and is generally obligated to indemnify us against any tax consequences if it breaches this agreement, the potential tax liabilities could have an adverse effect on us if we were not entitled to indemnification or if the indemnification obligations were not fulfilled. If the Animal Health Spin-off or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Animal Health Spin-off are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and/or our U.S. stockholders who participated in the Animal Health Spin-off could incur substantial U.S. federal income tax liabilities. There can be no assurance that we would be entitled to indemnification or that Covetrus would have the resources or liquidity required to indemnify us for any such taxable gain. In addition, we and/or our stockholders who participated in the Animal Health Spin-off could incur tax costs in foreign jurisdictions in connection with the transaction, irrespective of whether the Animal Health Spin-off qualifies as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThe Animal Health Spin-off may not achieve the intended benefits and may expose us to potential risks and liabilities.\nWe completed the Animal Health Spin-off on February 7, 2019. We undertook the transaction because, among other things, we believed that our animal health business could achieve greater growth by combining with Vets First Choice and that we could benefit from greater strategic focus of our resources and management efforts. We may not benefit as expected from the increased focus on our core business, strategic programs and objectives made possible by the Animal Health Spin-off. In addition, the value of the transaction may be reduced by potential liabilities related to post-closing adjustments and indemnities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe face inherent risk of exposure to product liability, intellectual property infringement and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury.\nOur business involves a risk of product liability, intellectual property infringement and other claims in the ordinary course of business, and from time to time we are named as a defendant in cases as a result of our distribution of products. Additionally, we own interests in companies that manufacture certain dental products. As a result, we are subject to the potential risk of product liability, intellectual property infringement or other claims relating to the manufacture and distribution of products by those entities. Additionally, as our private-label business continues to grow, purchasers of such products may increasingly seek recourse directly from us, rather than the ultimate product manufacturer, for product-related claims. Another potential risk we face in the distribution of our products is liability resulting from counterfeit or tainted products infiltrating the supply chain. In addition, some of the products that we transport and sell are considered hazardous materials. The improper handling of such materials or accidents involving the transportation of such materials could subject us to liability. In addition, our reputation could be adversely affected by negative publicity surrounding such events regardless of whether or not claims against us are successful. We have various insurance policies, including product liability insurance, covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate. In many cases in which we have been sued in connection with products manufactured by others, the manufacturer of the product provides us with indemnification. There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost, or that indemnification agreements will provide us with adequate protection. A successful claim brought against us in excess of available insurance or not covered by indemnification agreements, or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us, could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation.\nOur technology segment depends upon continued software and e-services product development, technical support and successful marketing.\nCompetition among companies supplying practice management software and/or e-services is intense and increasing. Our future sales of practice management software and e-services will depend on, among other factors:\n\u2022 the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs;\n\u2022 our ability to enhance our products and services to satisfy customer requirements; and\n\u2022 our ability to provide ongoing technical support.\nWe cannot be sure that we will be successful in introducing and marketing new software, software enhancements or e-services, or that such software, software enhancements and e-services will be released on time or accepted by the market. Our software and applicable e-services products, like software products generally, may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released. We cannot be sure that future problems with post-release software errors or bugs will not occur. Any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with the customers using such software as well as our reputation. We do not have any patents on our software or e-services, and rely upon copyright, trademark\nand trade secret laws, as well as contractual and common law protections. We cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available or enforceable to protect our software or e-services products.\nWe rely on third parties for certain technologically advanced products.\nSome of our products contain technologically advanced components, including software, that are developed by third parties. We may not be able to replace the functions provided by these third-party components or products if they become obsolete, defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or with our services and solutions, or if they are not adequately maintained or updated.\nIn addition, third-party suppliers of software or other intellectual property assets could be unwilling to permit us to use their intellectual property and this could impede or disrupt use of their products or services by us and our customers. Alternate sources for the technology currently provided by third parties to us may not be available to us in a timely manner, and may not provide us with the same functions as currently provided to us or may be more expensive than products we currently use or sell.\nFurther, the risk of intellectual property infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our business to include more technologically advanced products and continue to incorporate third party components, software and/or other intellectual property into the products we sell. Also, individuals and firms have purchased intellectual property assets in order to assert claims of infringement against technology providers and customers that use such technology. Any infringement action brought against us or our customers could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive settlement or judgment against us.\nThe risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results and our reputation.\nSecurity risks generally associated with our information systems and our technology products and services could materially adversely affect our business, and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if such products, services or systems (or third-party systems we rely on) are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events, are subject to cyberattacks or fail for any extended period of time.\nWe rely on information systems (IS) in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze, manage and store customer, product, supplier and employee data to, among other things:\n\u2022 maintain and manage worldwide systems to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers;\n\u2022 receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;\n\u2022 manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers;\n\u2022 process payments to suppliers; and\n\u2022 provide products and services that maintain certain of our customers\u2019 electronic medical or dental records (including protected health information of their patients).\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years, and a cyberattack that bypasses our IS security systems (including third-party systems we rely on) causing an IS security breach may lead to a material disruption of our IS business systems (including third-party systems we rely on) and/or the loss of business information resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, as well as claims against us by affected parties and/or governmental agencies, and involve fines and penalties, costs for remediation, and substantial defense and settlement expenses.\nIn addition, we develop products and provide services to our customers that are technology-based, and a cyberattack that bypasses the IS security systems of our products or services causing a security breach and/or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products or services could also cause significant reputational harm, and actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies. In particular, certain of our practice management products and services purchased by health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, are used to store and manage patient medical or dental records. These customers are subject to laws and regulations which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records, and our products may be used as part of these customers\u2019 comprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws. Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve fines and penalties, costs for remediation, and substantial defense and settlement expenses.\nRegarding direct customer claims, although our customer license agreements typically contain provisions that seek to eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges, or that we will be able to obtain such provisions in all cases.\nIn addition, our information systems also utilize certain third party service organizations that manage a portion of our information systems, and our business may be materially adversely affected if these third party service organizations are subject to a cyber attack. Additionally, legislative or regulatory action related to cybersecurity may increase our costs to develop or implement new technology products and services.\nRisks associated with these and other IS security breaches may include, among other things:\n\u2022 future results could be materially adversely affected due to the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property;\n\u2022 operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of information systems and subsequent clean-up and mitigation activities;\n\u2022 procedures and safeguards must continually evolve to meet new IS challenges, and enhancing protections, and conducting investigations and remediation, may impose additional costs on us;\n\u2022 we may incur claims, fines and penalties, and costs for remediation, or substantial defense and settlement expenses; and\n\u2022 negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our customers, partners or industry peers.\nWe also deliver Internet-based services and, accordingly, depend on our ability and the ability of our customers to access the Internet. In the event of any difficulties, outages and delays by Internet service providers, we may be impeded from providing such services, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation.\nWe have various insurance policies, including cyber liability insurance, covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate. There can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we maintain is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost. Successful claims for misappropriation or release of confidential or personal data brought against us in excess of available insurance or fines or other penalties assessed or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and our reputation.\nCertain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may discourage third-party offers to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares.\nThe provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, may discourage acquisition bids and may limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions, among other things:\n\u2022 require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 60% of the shares of common stock entitled to vote to approve a merger, consolidation, or a sale, lease, transfer or exchange of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022 require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our common stock entitled to vote to (i) remove a director; and (ii) to amend or repeal our by-laws, with certain limited exceptions.\nIn addition, our 2013 Stock Incentive Plan and 2015 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan provide for accelerated vesting of stock options upon a change in control. These incentive plans also authorize the committee under the plans to provide for accelerated vesting of other types of equity awards in connection with a change in control at grant or thereafter, and certain other awards made under these incentive plans (such as restricted stock/unit awards) accelerate upon a change in control or upon certain termination events in connection with a change in control. Further, certain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for increased severance payments and certain benefits if those executive officers are terminated without cause by us or if they terminate for good reason, in each case within two years after a change in control or within ninety days prior to the effective date of the change in control or after the first public announcement of the pendency of the change in control.\nTax legislation could materially adversely affect our financial results and tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments, as well as foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could materially adversely affect our tax positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate will not be materially adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives. On December 22, 2017, the President signed the Tax Act into law, which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates, international tax provisions, income tax add-back provisions and deductions. In addition, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. Although we believe that our historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.", "PERMNO": 82581, "SIC": 5047, "TIC": "HSIC"}
