RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, prospects and the market value of our securities are subject to numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, prospects and the market value of our securities may be materially and adversely affected. Other factors beyond those listed below, including factors unknown to us and factors known to us which we have not currently determined to be material, could also adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, prospects and the market value of our securities. Also see \u201cSpecial Note of Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d above.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business and financial performance depend in part on the level of activity in the oil and gas industries.\nApproximately 60% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were derived from sales to companies in the oil and gas industries. As a result, our operations depend, in part, on the levels of activity in oil and gas exploration, development and production. More specifically, the demand for the proppants we produce is closely related to the number of oil and gas wells completed in geological formations where sand-based proppants are used in hydraulic fracturing activities. These activity levels are affected by both short- and long-term trends in oil and gas prices, among other factors.\nIndustry conditions that impact the activity levels of oil and natural gas producers are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including:\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulations, including the policies of governments regarding the exploration for and production and development of their oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\nglobal weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\nworldwide political, military and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe cost of producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\ncommodity prices;\n\u2022\ndevelopment of alternative energy sources;\n\u2022\nchanges in demand for proppants; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of the oil and gas industry to comply with U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) standards for respirable dust.\nIn recent years, oil and gas prices and, therefore, the level of exploration, development and production activity, have experienced significant fluctuations. Worldwide economic, political and military events, including war, terrorist activity, events in the Middle East and initiatives by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) and other large non-OPEC producers have contributed, and are likely to continue to contribute, to price and volume volatility. Additionally, warmer than normal winters in North America and other weather patterns may adversely impact the short-term demand for natural gas and, therefore, demand for our products. Reduction in demand for natural gas to generate electricity could also adversely impact the demand for frac sand.\nAny significant reduction in oil and natural gas prices would generally depress the level of oil and natural gas exploration, development, production and well completion activity, which could result in a corresponding decline in the demand for the frac sand we produce. Such a decline could result in Covia selling fewer tons of frac sand at lower prices or selling lower priced products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. When demand for frac sand increases, there may not be a corresponding increase in the prices for our products or our customers may not switch back to higher-priced products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The commercial development of economically-viable alternative energy sources could have a similar effect. In addition, the price we receive for sales of frac sand may be impacted by short-term fluctuations in the demand for frac sand, and any negative fluctuations in this demand could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nAny future decreases in the rate at which oil and natural gas reserves are discovered or developed may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, even in a stronger oil and natural gas price environment.\nOur operations are subject to the seasonal and/or cyclical nature of our customers\u2019 businesses, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe substantial majority of our sales are to customers in industries that have historically been seasonal, such as glassmaking, construction and foundry, and/or cyclical, such as the oil and natural gas industry. During periods of economic slowdown, such customers often reduce their production rates and also reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects. Such developments occur even among customers that are not experiencing financial difficulties.\nDemand for industrial minerals is driven to a large extent by the construction and automotive industries. For example, demand for flat glass depends on the automotive and commercial and residential construction and remodeling industries, demand for commercial silica used to manufacture building products is driven primarily by demand in the construction industry and demand for foundry silica substantially depends on the rate of automobile, light truck and heavy equipment production as well as construction. Other factors influencing the demand for industrial minerals include (i) the substitution of plastic or other materials for glass, (ii) competition from offshore producers of glass products, (iii) changes in demand for our products due to technological innovations and (iv) prices, availability and other factors relating to our products.\nWe cannot predict or control the factors that affect demand for our products. Negative developments in the above factors, among others, could cause the demand for industrial and recreational sand to decline, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nIn addition, transportation costs represent one of the largest costs for our customers and, if in response to economic pressures, such customers choose to move their production offshore, the increased logistics costs could reduce demand for our products. Continued weakness in the industries we serve has had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on sales of our products and our results of operations. A continued or renewed economic downturn in one or more of the industries or geographic regions that we serve, or in the worldwide economy, could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from historical and expected results.\nA lack of dependable or available transportation services or infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have contracts with rail, truck, ship and barge services to move materials from our mines to our production facilities and to move products on to our customers. Any significant delays, disruptions or the non-availability of transportation systems and services caused by, among other things, labor disputes, strikes, lock-outs, lack of maintenance, human error or malfeasance, accidents, transportation delays, mechanical difficulties, shortages of railcars, trucks, ships or barges, train derailments, bottlenecks, adverse weather conditions, earthquakes, storms, flooding, drought, other natural disasters or environmental events, increased railcar congestion or other events could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, these events could temporarily impair our ability to supply customers through our logistics network of rail-based terminals or, if our customers are not using our rail transportation services, the ability of customers to take delivery and, in certain circumstances, constitute a force majeure event under our customer contracts, permitting customers to suspend taking delivery of and paying for our products. As we continue to expand our production, we will need to increase our investment in transportation infrastructure, including most significantly, additional terminals and railcars.\nWe depend on rail transportation to transport our products.\nOur business depends significantly on rail transportation. A significant disruption of the rail transportation services utilized by us or our customers could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nRail traffic congestion has increased throughout the U.S. in recent years, primarily due to overall growth in railroad volumes and a delayed response from the railroads to adjust to the increased demand for rail transportation. From time to time, high demand and unusually adverse weather conditions may cause rail congestion, delays and logistical problems. Rail congestion or shortages may affect our ability to supply our products to customers in a timely or cost-effective manner, particularly in situations where our facilities are not located close to customer locations.\nRailcar availability may also affect our ability to transport our products. In addition to the products we supply, railcars transport many types of products across various industries. If railcar owners sell or lease railcars to our competitors or to companies operating in other industries, we may not have enough railcars to transport our products. Alternatively, if we experience a decline in sales, we may have railcar overcapacity, which could cause us to incur both railcar storage fees and lease costs for railcars in storage.\nWe invest significantly in maintaining and upgrading our railcar fleet to meet customers\u2019 needs and to compete effectively with alternative suppliers. Our failure to properly anticipate our customers\u2019 rail transportation needs or to effectively expend capital could result in us losing business to our competitors.\nIn many cases, we rely on third parties to maintain the rail lines from our facilities to the national rail network, and any failure by those third parties to maintain the lines could impede our delivery of products, impose additional costs on Covia and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on trucking to transport a significant portion of our products, particularly in areas of increasing demand for our products. A shortage of available truck drivers and difficulty in truck driver recruitment and retention may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition to our rail network, we depend on trucking services, particularly in areas in which our customers\u2019 activity has rapidly increased resulting in spikes in demand for transportation. For example, we have recently experienced a significant increase in demand from the Permian Basin in West Texas. As a result, there is high demand for qualified truck drivers to supply the goods necessary to support the increased activity in West Texas at a time when unemployment in the region is low, putting significant pressure on the supply of available qualified truck drivers. Any delay or inability to secure the personnel and services necessary to deliver our products to customers in high activity areas in a timely and cost-effective manner could cause customers to use a competitor and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe U.S. trucking industry as a whole periodically experiences a shortage of qualified drivers, sometimes during periods of economic expansion in which alternative employment opportunities are more plentiful and freight demand increases, or alternatively during periods of economic downturns, in which unemployment benefits might be extended and financing may be limited for independent contractors who seek to purchase equipment or for students who seek financial aid for driving school. Our independent contractors are responsible for paying for their own equipment, fuel and other operating costs, and significant increases in these costs could cause them to seek higher compensation from us or seek other opportunities within or outside the trucking industry.\nThe U.S. trucking industry also suffers from a high driver turnover rate. If we are unable to attract qualified independent contractors, we could be forced to, among other things, limit our growth, decrease the number of tractors in service, adjust independent contractor compensation, or pay higher rates to third-party truckload carriers, which could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations if not offset by a corresponding increase in customer rates.\nWe are subject to the risks of owning and operating the Winchester & Western railroad.\nWe own and operate the Winchester & Western railroad, a private railroad in New Jersey, West Virginia, Virginia and Maryland. We use the Winchester & Western railroad to move minerals from our Dividing Creek and Gore facilities to customers via access to the Norfolk Southern and CSX railroads. Operating a railroad is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including potential public safety concerns, claims for personal injury and property damage, accidents involving trespassers on the railway, railroad crossing accidents, failure of information technology, severe weather conditions, access to a limited number of suppliers of locomotives and railway equipment, and significant government regulation of health, safety, labor, environmental and other matters. In addition, due to the nature of the railroad business, our railroad operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to waters and, to the extent we utilize the railroad to transport hazardous waste, risks in the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and other materials. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and results.\nIncreasing logistics and transportation costs could reduce our revenues by causing our customers to reduce production or by impairing our ability to deliver products to customers.\nTransportation, handling and related costs, including freight charges, fuel surcharges, transloading fees, switching fees, railcar lease costs, demurrage costs and storage fees, tend to be a significant component of our total delivered cost of sales. In many instances, transportation costs can represent up to 70% of the delivered cost of our products. As a result, the cost of transportation is a critical factor in a customer\u2019s purchasing decision. The high relative cost of transportation related expense tends to favor manufacturers located closely to the customer. Increased costs that cannot be passed on to customers could impair our ability to deliver products economically to customers or to expand our customer base. In addition, our competitors may be able to deliver products to our customers with lower transportation costs, which, in certain cases, may result in us losing business.\nWe transport significant volumes of minerals across long distances and international borders. Any increases in our logistics costs, as a result of increases in the price of oil or otherwise, would increase our costs and the prices of our products. In addition, any increases in customs or tariffs, as a result of changes to existing trade agreements between countries or otherwise, could increase our costs, the prices of our products to customers or decrease our margins. Such increases could harm our competitive position and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nGeographic shifts in demand could negatively impact our business.\nA significant portion of our distribution infrastructure is located in or near oil and gas producing areas. However, a significant portion of our frac sand processing facilities are located significant distances from our customers. Similarly, in our Industrial segment, a portion of our sales benefit from having facilities in close proximity to customer locations. A shift in demand away from areas where we have significant distribution infrastructure or the relocation of our customers\u2019 businesses to areas farther from our facilities or distribution infrastructure could increase our costs for delivering products or result in our inability to supply certain customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages by railroad workers, truckers and port workers.\nThere has been labor unrest, including strikes and work stoppages, among workers at various transportation providers and in industries affecting the transportation industry. We could lose business due to any significant work stoppage or slowdown and, if labor unrest results in increased rates for transportation providers such as truckers or railroad workers, we may not be able to pass these cost increases on to our customers. Future strikes by railroad workers in the U.S., Canada or anywhere else where our customers\u2019 freight travels by railroad would impact our operations. Any significant work stoppage, slowdown or other disruption involving railroads, truckers, ports or draymen could have a material adverse effect our business and results of operations.\nOur operations are dependent on our rights and ability to mine properties and on having renewed or received the required permits and approvals from governmental authorities and other third parties.\nWe hold numerous governmental, environmental, mining and other permits, water rights and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities. A decision by a governmental agency or other third party to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility. Furthermore, federal, state and local governments could impose a moratorium on mining operations in certain areas. Expansion of our existing operations is also predicated on securing the necessary environmental or other permits, and water rights or approvals, which we may not receive in a timely manner or at all. In addition, certain of our facilities are located near existing and proposed third-party industrial operations, which could affect our ability to fully extract, or the manner in which we extract, the mineral reserves to which we have mining rights.\nIn some instances, we have received access rights or easements from third parties, which allow for a more efficient operation than would exist without the access or easement. A third party could take action to suspend the access or easement, and any such action could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nChanges in product mix can have an adverse effect on our gross margins and could cause our results of operations to fluctuate.\nWe produce many different products from the minerals we extract. Customers in the same industry may use different products for similar purposes, some of which may require more processing than others and subsequently may be more expensive for us to produce. The costs we experience at our manufacturing locations depend significantly on the mix of products produced, not all of which we may be able to pass along to customers, which can reduce our margins and which may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. Furthermore, if one or more industries that we supply experience a significant shift in products, we could be forced to undertake significant expenditures to upgrade our operations to supply the products or to acquire or build additional production capacity in order to meet this demand to the extent our current operations cannot be retrofitted to supply such demand.\nWe may be adversely affected by decreased, or shifts in, demand for frac sand or the development of effective alternative proppants or new processes that replace hydraulic fracturing.\nFrac sand and coated sand are proppants used in the completion and re-completion of oil and natural gas wells through the process of hydraulic fracturing. Frac sand is the most commonly used proppant and is less expensive than ceramic proppant. A significant shift\nin demand from sand-based proppants to other proppants, such as ceramic proppants, or a shift in demand from higher-margin sand-based proppants to lower-margin sand-based proppants, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The hydraulic fracturing industry is not fully mature and is still subject to technological change (for example, horizontal drilling and fracturing is currently less than 10 years old). The development and use of new technologies for effective alternative proppants, new technologies allowing for improved placement of proppants at reduced volumes, or the development of new processes to replace hydraulic fracturing altogether, could also cause a decline in demand for the sand-based proppants we produce and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, the increase in supply of in-basin sand, which may be of lower cost, in the Permian and Eagle Ford basins, could adversely affect our business, particularly at locations where we sell Northern White sand. In addition, the discovery by competitors of minerals in locations which are closer to our customers could provide competitors with a geographic advantage. Any significant reduction in demand for products sold from our facilities could have an adverse effect on our profitability, results of operations and financial condition.\nA large percentage of our sales are subject to fluctuations in market pricing.\nA large percentage of our supply agreements have market-based pricing mechanisms. Accordingly, in periods with decreasing prices, our results of operations may be lower than if our supply agreements had fixed prices. In periods with increasing prices, our supply agreements permit us to increase prices; however, our customers may elect to cease purchasing our products if they do not agree with the price increases or are able to find alternative, cheaper sources of supply. Furthermore, certain volume-based supply agreements may influence our ability to fully capture current market pricing as such agreement may fix pricing. These pricing provisions may result in significant variability in our results of operations and cash flows from period to period.\nA significant percentage of our volumes are also supplied under fixed price contracts. Over the life of such contracts, the contracted price for such minerals may be below the current market price, at times, significantly so. During such periods, this dynamic may depress our profit margins as compared to industry peers.\nChanges in supply and demand dynamics could also impact market pricing for our products. A number of existing frac sand providers and new industry entrants have recently announced reserve acquisitions, processing capacity expansions and greenfield projects. In periods where sources of supply of raw frac sand exceed demand, prices for frac sand may decline and our results of operations and cash flows may decline, be volatile or otherwise be adversely affected. For example, several new and current sand suppliers have developed new in-basin facilities in the Permian, Mid-Continental, and Eagle Ford basins. While the quality and type of proppants produced in-basin are not always the same as those produced in Northern White locations, the cost of this in-basin sand could be lower and the increase in supply of in-basin sand could become a suitable replacement for all or a portion of the Northern White sands particularly if customers change their sizing and quality specifications to favor in-basin sands. These factors could adversely affect our business, particularly at locations where we sell Northern White sand.\nWe may not be able to complete capital expansion projects, the actual costs of any capacity expansion may exceed estimated costs, and we may not be able to secure demand for the incremental production capacity. In addition, actual operating costs for the new capacity may be higher than anticipated.\nWe undertake projects from time to time to expand our production capacity and distribution network and to modernize operations. For example, we are currently constructing a new facility in the Permian and basin and are modernizing our nepheline syenite operations in Canada.\nCapital expansion projects are subject to numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal risks and uncertainties beyond our control that could delay the expansion, construction or optimization of our facilities, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour ability to timely obtain necessary authorizations, approvals and permits from regulatory agencies (including environmental agencies, such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agency, where our current operations or future expansion plans in West Texas could be slowed or halted due to conservation efforts targeted at the habitat of the dunes sagebrush lizard) on terms acceptable to us;\n\u2022\npotential changes in applicable federal, state and local statutes and regulations, including environmental requirements, that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated cost of the project;\n\u2022\nthe inability to acquire rights-of-way or land or water rights on a timely basis on terms acceptable to us;\n\u2022\nthe inability to acquire necessary energy supplies, including electricity, natural gas and diesel fuel;\n\u2022\nlabor shortage risks, safety issues and work stoppages;\n\u2022\nengineering issues;\n\u2022\ncontamination problems;\n\u2022\nequipment or raw material supply constraints; and\n\u2022\nunexpected equipment maintenance requirements.\nAny capital expansion will require us to spend substantial capital. If the assumptions on which our estimated capital expenditures are based change or are inaccurate, we may require additional funding. Such funding may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. Moreover, actual operating costs after we complete a capacity expansion project may be higher than initially anticipated. We also may not secure off-take commitments for the incremental production from the incremental capacity and may not be able to secure adequate demand for the incremental production.\nIf we undertake capital expansion projects, they may not be completed on schedule or at the budgeted cost or at all. Moreover, upon the expenditure of future funds on a particular project, our revenues may not increase immediately, or as anticipated, or at all. For instance, we may construct new facilities over an extended period of time and will not receive any material increases in revenues until the projects are completed. Moreover, we may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in a location in which such growth does not materialize or for which we are unable to acquire new customers. We may also rely on estimates of proved, probable or possible reserves in our decision to undertake expansion projects, which may prove to be inaccurate. As a result, our new facilities and infrastructure may be unable to achieve our expected investment return, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Furthermore, substantial investments in our transportation infrastructure may be required to effectively execute the capacity expansion, and we may not be successful in expanding our logistical capabilities to accommodate the additional production capacity.\nAny failure to successfully implement any capacity expansion plans or realize the anticipated benefits of our capacity expansion plans could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely upon trade secrets, contractual restrictions and patents to protect our proprietary rights. Failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position, and protecting our rights or defending against third-party allegations of infringement may be costly.\nOur commercial success depends on our proprietary information and technologies, know-how and other intellectual property. Because of the technical nature of our business, we rely on patents, trade secrets, trademarks and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights. The measures we take to protect our trade secrets and other intellectual property rights may be insufficient. If we fail to protect, monitor and control the use of existing intellectual property rights, we could lose our competitive advantage and incur significant expenses. Our competitors or others could independently develop the same or similar technologies or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technologies. In such case, our trade secrets would not prevent third parties from competing with us and our results of operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, third parties or our employees may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights, which could also harm our business and results of operations. Policing unauthorized use of intellectual property rights can be difficult and expensive, and adequate remedies may not be available.\nIn addition, third parties may claim that our products infringe or otherwise violate their patents or other proprietary rights and seek corresponding damages or injunctive relief. Defending against such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and result in costly litigation. An adverse outcome in any such litigation could subject us to significant liability to third parties (potentially including treble damages) or temporary or permanent injunctions prohibiting the manufacture or sale of our products, the use of our technologies or the conduct of our business. Any adverse outcome could also require us to seek licenses from third parties (which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all) or to make substantial one-time or ongoing royalty payments. Protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our products until resolution of such litigation. In addition, we may not have insurance coverage in connection with such litigation and may have to bear all costs arising from any such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future performance will depend on our ability to succeed in competitive industries and to appropriately react to potential fluctuations in demand for and supply of our products.\nWe operate in highly competitive industries involving a number of large, national producers and a larger number of small, regional or local producers. Competition in the industries in which we operate is based on price, consistency and quality of product, site location, distribution and logistics capabilities, customer service, reliability of supply, breadth of product offering, availability of economic substitutes and technical support. Certain of our large competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do, may develop superior technology or may have production facilities that are located closer to key customers than our facilities. Furthermore, competitors may choose to consolidate, which could provide them with greater financial and other resources and negatively impact demand for our products.\nWe also compete with smaller, regional or local producers. For instance, prior to 2015, there had been an increasing number of small producers servicing frac sand customers due to increased demand for hydraulic fracturing services. If demand for hydraulic fracturing services decreases and the supply of frac sand increases, prices for frac sand could continue to materially decrease as less-efficient producers exit the industry, causing frac sand to sell at below market prices. In addition, oil and natural gas exploration and production companies and other providers of hydraulic fracturing services could acquire their own frac sand reserves, expand their existing frac sand production capacity or otherwise fulfill their own proppant requirements and existing or new frac sand producers could add to or expand their frac sand production capacity, which may negatively impact demand for our frac sand products.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against either larger or smaller competitors in the future, and competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our products may be susceptible to displacement by alternative products.\nOur customers have limited alternatives currently available for certain of our products. For example, we are one of the world\u2019s leading producers of low-iron nepheline syenite used in glass, ceramics, paint and plastics. However, while there are currently limited alternatives available to our nepheline syenite customers, other minerals can provide similar functional benefits. If these alternative products can be processed to provide a more cost-effective solution, the nature of the business presents an increased risk of an industry-wide switch to such alternative product, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe initial and sustained commercialization of our products may prove to be unsuccessful.\nThe products we develop may or may not be technically viable, and those that are technically viable may not be or remain commercially viable. For example, a return to or a prolonged decline in the oil and gas market may make the adoption of higher-value products, such as Propel SSP\u00ae products, more difficult. Additionally, competitive products could be developed and marketed. A failure to capitalize on Propel SSP\u00ae products in commercial application would result in a significant unrecouped investment and the failure to realize certain anticipated benefits, each of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf our customers delay or fail to pay a significant amount of their outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully eliminate customer credit risk. Our customers may delay or fail to pay their invoices or may experience financial difficulties, including insolvency. In weak economic environments, we may experience increased delays or failures due to, among other reasons, a reduction in customers\u2019 cash flow from operations and their access to the credit markets. We may not be able to collect sums owed customers who file for bankruptcy protection, and also may be required to refund pre-petition amounts paid during the preference period (typically 90 days) prior to the bankruptcy filing. If our customers delay or fail to pay a significant amount of their outstanding receivables, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA large portion of our sales is generated by a limited number of customers, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in purchases by, our largest customers could adversely affect our operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 44% of our sales, and our largest customer accounted for approximately 13% of our sales. These customers may not continue to purchase the same level of our products in the future due to a variety of reasons. For example, some of our top customers could go out of business or, alternatively, be acquired by other companies that purchase the same products and services provided by us from other third-party providers. Our customers could also seek to capture and develop their own sources of minerals they purchase from us.\nWe have sold product to our largest customers on both a purchase order basis and pursuant to supply agreements. We currently have supply agreements with certain of our top customers that contain customary termination provisions for bankruptcy related events and uncured breaches of the applicable agreement. Upon the expiration of our current supply agreements, we may choose to renegotiate existing contracts on less favorable terms or at reduced volumes in order to preserve relationships with our customers. Upon the expiration of our current contract terms, we may be unable to renew existing contracts or enter into new contracts on terms favorable to us, or at all. The demand for our products or prevailing prices at the time our current supply agreements expire may render entry into new long-term supply agreements difficult or impossible. Any renegotiation of our contracts on less favorable terms, or inability to enter into new contracts on economically acceptable terms upon the expiration of our current contracts, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf any of our major customers substantially reduces or altogether ceases purchasing our products and we are not able to generate replacement sales, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nCertain of our contracts contain provisions requiring us to deliver minimum amounts of minerals or purchase minimum amounts of services. Noncompliance with these contractual obligations may result in fees or termination of the agreement.\nIn certain instances, we commit to deliver products or purchase services under threat of nonperformance. If we are unable to meet the minimum contract requirements, the counterparty may be permitted to terminate the agreement or require us to pay a fee. The amount of the fee may be based on the difference between the minimum amount contracted for and the amount delivered or purchased. In such events, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur operations are subject to operating risks that are often beyond our control and could adversely affect production levels and costs, and such risks may not be covered by insurance.\nOur mining, processing and production facilities are subject to risks normally encountered by such facilities in the industries in which we operate. In addition to the risks described elsewhere in this item, these risks include:\n\u2022\nchanges in the price and availability of natural gas, propane, fuel oil or electricity;\n\u2022\nchanges in the costs of producing various products;\n\u2022\ncave-ins, pit wall failures, stockpile sloughs or rock falls, particularly in underground mines;\n\u2022\nunanticipated ground, grade, sinkhole or water conditions;\n\u2022\nindustrial accidents, including injuries to key personnel;\n\u2022\nphysical facility security breaches;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations (or the interpretation thereof) or increased public scrutiny related to the mining, drilling, well completion and hydraulic fracturing industries, silica dust exposure or the environment;\n\u2022\nnonperformance of contractual obligations;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on blasting and mining operations, including potential moratoriums on mining as a result of local activism or complaints;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain necessary production equipment or replacement parts in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nlabor disputes;\n\u2022\ntechnical difficulties or key equipment failures;\n\u2022\nfires, explosions or other accidents;\n\u2022\nfacility shutdowns in response to environmental regulatory actions;\n\u2022\nfacility shutdowns or losses due to community restrictions; and\nAny of these risks could result in damage to, or destruction of, our mining properties or production facilities, personal injury, environmental damage, delays in mining or processing, losses or possible legal liability. Any prolonged downtime or shutdowns at our mining properties or production facilities could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, not all of these risks are reasonably insurable, and our insurance coverage contains limits, deductibles, exclusions and endorsements. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to meet our needs in the event of loss, and any such loss may have a material adverse effect on Covia.\nA significant portion of our volume is generated from our Utica, Kasota, Wedron and Tunnel City production facilities. Additionally, a significant portion of our energy sales are generated at terminals located in various shale plays. Any adverse developments at any of these production facilities and terminals or in the industries they serve could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our volumes are generated from our Utica, Illinois, Kasota, Minnesota, Wedron, Illinois, and Tunnel City, Wisconsin production facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 50% of our total volumes were shipped from these facilities. In addition, a significant portion of our energy sales are generated at terminals located in various shale plays. Any adverse developments at these production facilities and terminals or in the industries these facilities serve, including adverse developments due to catastrophic events or weather (including floods, windstorms, ice storms or tornadoes), adverse government regulatory impacts, private actions by residents of the local or surrounding communities, or transportation-related constraints, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, any adverse development at our production facilities that would cause us to curtail, suspend or terminate operations at the production facilities could result in being unable to meet contracted deliveries. If we are unable to deliver contracted volumes within the required time frame, or otherwise arrange for delivery from a third party, we could be required to pay make-whole payments to customers that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe manufacture of our products is dependent on the availability of raw materials and feedstocks.\nWe depend on suppliers for the raw materials and feedstocks necessary to produce many of our products. If we are unable to secure adequate, cost effective supply commitments for the raw materials and feedstocks associated with our products, our ability to produce and sell various products at profitable margins may be adversely impacted. Many raw materials and feedstocks are not sold pursuant to long-term contracts and we cannot guarantee that our suppliers will continue to provide necessary raw materials or feedstocks at reasonable prices or at all. The loss of key suppliers could have material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nReduced access, lack of or inability to obtain access to water may adversely affect our operations or the operations of our customers.\nThe mining and processing activities in which we engage at a number of our facilities require significant amounts of water, and some of our facilities are located in areas that are water-constrained. Additionally, the development of oil and gas properties through fracture stimulation likewise requires significant water use. We have obtained water rights that we currently use to service the activities on various properties, and we plan to obtain all required water rights to service other properties we may develop or acquire in the future. However, the amount of water that we and our customers are entitled to use pursuant to our water rights must be determined by the appropriate regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we and our customers operate. Such regulatory authorities may amend the regulations regarding such water rights, increase the cost of maintaining such water rights or eliminate our current water rights, and we and our customers may be unable to retain all or a portion of such water rights. These new regulations, which could also affect local municipalities and other industrial operations, could have a material adverse effect on our operating costs and effectiveness if implemented. Such changes in laws, regulations or government policy and related interpretations pertaining to water rights may alter the environment in which we and our customers do business, which may negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, a water discharge permit may be required to properly dispose of water at our processing sites. The water discharge permitting process is also subject to regulatory discretion, and any inability to obtain the necessary permits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nTitle to our mineral properties and water rights, and royalties related to our production, may be disputed.\nTitle to, and the area of, mineral properties and water rights, and royalties related to our production of sand and other minerals, may be disputed. A successful claim that we lack appropriate mineral and water rights on one or more of our properties could cause us to lose any rights to explore, develop and operate mines on that property. Any decrease or disruption in our mineral rights may adversely affect our operations. In some instances, we have received access rights or easements from third parties, which allow for a more efficient operation than would exist without the access or easement. A third party could take action to suspend the access or easement, and any such action could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe do not own the land on which the majority of our terminal facilities are located and in some cases do not own the related terminal assets and, as a result, we rely on long term leases or access agreements with third parties, including customers, with respect to certain of our terminal facilities and related assets, the loss or renegotiation which could disrupt our operations.\nWe do not own the land on which the majority of our terminals are located and instead own leasehold interests and rights-of-way for the operation of these facilities. Upon expiration, termination or other lapse of our current leasehold terms, we may be unable to renew our existing leases or rights-of-way on terms favorable to us, or at all. Any renegotiation on less favorable terms or inability to enter into new leases on economically acceptable terms upon the expiration, termination or other lapse of our current leases or rights-of-way could cause us to cease operations on the affected land, increase costs related to continuing operations elsewhere and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, operating a terminal under a lease can involve escalating costs to us and additional operational difficulties, including with regard to hiring and retaining skilled personnel.\nIn addition, with respect to certain terminals, we do not own the terminal assets themselves. With respect to these terminals, we have negotiated either long term leases with third parties or, in the case of certain customer-owned terminals, exclusive access agreements to the terminal. Any leases are subject to the risks of renegotiation at less favorable terms or the risk of failure to enter into new leases on economically acceptable terms. In certain circumstances, the terminals we use are owned by customers and our terminal access agreements are tied to supply agreements with these customers. In these cases, it is possible that our ability to continue operating these terminals could be impeded if the customer\u2019s volume needs diverge from our ability to supply those needs and the customer no longer allows us access to or use of the terminals.\nIf we cannot successfully complete acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses, our growth may be limited and our financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOne element of our business strategy includes supplementing internal growth by pursuing acquisitions. Any acquisition may involve potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe validity of our assumptions about mineral reserves and future production, sales, capital expenditures, operating expenses and costs, including synergies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and delays in realizing anticipated benefits from the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nan inability to successfully integrate the businesses that are acquired;\n\u2022\nthe use of a significant portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity to finance acquisitions and the subsequent decrease in our liquidity;\n\u2022\na significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which the indemnity we obtained is inadequate;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nan inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel both to manage and to operate our growing business and assets;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of other significant charges, such as impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, asset devaluation or restructuring charges;\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties encountered in operating in new geographic areas;\n\u2022\nthe loss of customers or key employees at the acquired businesses; and\n\u2022\nthe accuracy of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies, geophysical and geological analyses, and other information used when deciding to acquire a property, the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations.\nIf we cannot successfully complete acquisitions, realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or integrate acquired businesses, our growth or financial condition may be adversely affected.\nInaccuracies in our estimates of mineral reserves could result in lower than expected sales and higher than expected costs.\nWe base our mineral reserve estimates on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our engineers and geologists, which are reviewed by outside firms. However, estimates of the quantities and qualities of mineral reserves and costs to mine recoverable reserves are imprecise because they are based on a number of factors and assumptions, all of which may vary considerably from actual results, such as:\n\u2022\nstatistical inferences drawn from available drilling data;\n\u2022\nproducts, operating costs, mining technology improvements, development costs and reclamation costs;\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning future effects of regulation, including the issuance of required permits and taxes by governmental agencies; and\n\u2022\nchanges in product mix.\nAny inaccuracy in our estimates related to our mineral reserves could result in lower than expected sales and higher than expected costs.\nMine closures entail substantial costs, and if we close one or more of our mines sooner than anticipated, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe base our assumptions regarding the life of our mines on detailed studies that we perform from time to time, but these studies and the underlying assumptions are not always accurate. If we close any of our mines sooner than expected, sales will decline unless we are able to increase production at other mines, which may not be possible. The closure of a mine also involves significant fixed closure costs, including accelerated employment legacy costs, severance-related obligations, reclamation and other environmental costs and the costs of terminating long-term obligations, including energy contracts and equipment leases. We accrue for the costs of reclaiming open pits, stockpiles, tailings ponds, roads and other mining support areas over the estimated mining life of our property. If we reduce the estimated life of any of our mines, the fixed mine closure costs would be applied to a shorter period of production, which would increase production costs per ton produced and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nApplicable statutes and regulations require that mining property be reclaimed following a mine closure in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan. The reclamation plan must address matters such as removal of facilities and equipment, regrading, prevention of erosion and other forms of water pollution, re-vegetation and post-mining land use. We may be required to post a surety bond or other form of financial assurance equal to the cost of reclamation as set forth in the approved reclamation plan. The establishment of the final mine closure reclamation liability is based on permit requirements and requires various estimates and assumptions, principally associated with reclamation costs and production levels. If our accruals for expected reclamation and other costs associated with mine closures for which we will be responsible are determined to be insufficient, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOur production processes consume large amounts of natural gas and electricity. An increase in the price or a significant interruption in the supply of these or any other significant raw material costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nEnergy costs, primarily natural gas and electricity, are among our highest costs of goods sold. Natural gas is the primary fuel source used for drying sand in the commercial silica production process and, as such, our profitability is impacted by the price and availability of natural gas we purchase from third parties. The price and supply of natural gas are unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly based on international, political and economic circumstances, as well as other events outside our control, such as changes in supply and demand due to weather conditions, actions by OPEC and other oil and natural gas producers, regional production\npatterns and environmental concerns. Furthermore, utility companies could enforce natural gas curtailments that affect our operations. In addition, potential climate change regulations or carbon or emissions taxes could result in higher production costs for energy, which may be passed on to us in whole or in part. In the past, the price of natural gas has been extremely volatile, and we expect that this volatility may continue. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2018, the monthly closing price of natural gas on the New York Mercantile Exchange ranged from a high of $4.72 per million British Thermal Units (\u201cBTUs\u201d) to a low of $2.64 per million BTUs. In order to manage the volatility risk, we may hedge natural gas prices through the use of derivative financial instruments, such as forwards, swaps and futures. However, these measures carry risk (including nonperformance by counterparties) and do not eliminate the risk of decreased margins as a result of natural gas price increases. A significant increase in the price of energy that is not recovered through an increase in the price of our products or an extended interruption in the supply of natural gas or electricity to our production facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nIncreases in the price of diesel fuel may adversely affect our results of operations.\nDiesel fuel costs generally fluctuate with increasing and decreasing global crude oil prices and accordingly are subject to political, economic and market factors that are outside of our control. Our operations are dependent on earthmoving equipment, railcars and tractor trailers, and diesel fuel costs are a significant component of the operating expense of these vehicles. We use earthmoving equipment in our mining operations, and we ship the vast majority of our products by either railcar or tractor trailer. To the extent that we perform these services with equipment that we own, we are responsible for buying and supplying the diesel fuel needed to operate these vehicles. To the extent that these services are provided by independent contractors, we may be subject to fuel surcharges that attempt to recoup increased diesel fuel expenses. To the extent that we are unable to pass along increased diesel fuel costs to our customers, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nPhenol is the primary component of the resins we buy, and our resin supply agreements contain market-based pricing provisions based on the cost of phenol. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in the prices for phenol.\nA significant increase in the price of phenol that is not recovered through an increase in the price of our resin products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA shortage of skilled labor together with rising labor costs in the mining industry may further increase operating costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nEfficient mining using modern techniques and equipment requires skilled laborers, preferably with several years of experience and proficiency in multiple mining tasks, including processing of mined minerals. If the shortage of experienced labor continues or worsens or if we are unable to train the necessary number of skilled laborers, there could be an adverse impact on our labor productivity and costs and our ability to expand production.\nOur business may suffer if we lose, or are unable to attract and retain, key personnel.\nOur success depends, to a large extent, on the services of our key personnel and on our ability to attract, employ and retain highly-skilled personnel. Our key employees have extensive experience and expertise in evaluating and analyzing industrial mineral properties, building new processing facilities, maximizing production from such properties, marketing industrial mineral production, transportation, distribution and developing and executing financing and hedging strategies, as well as substantial experience and relationships with participants in the industries that we serve. Competition for management and key personnel is intense, and the pool of qualified candidates is limited. Further, most of our key employees are not employed pursuant to employment agreements. The loss of any of our key employees or the failure to attract additional personnel, as needed, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and could lead to higher labor costs or the use of less-qualified personnel. If any of our key employees join a competitor, or form a competing company, the company could lose customers, suppliers, know-how and key personnel. We do not maintain key-man life insurance with respect to any of our employees.\nOur profitability could be negatively affected if we fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, approximately 34% of our labor force was covered under 28 union agreements in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. These agreements are renegotiated when their terms expire. There are three agreements that are due to be renegotiated in 2019 for the U.S. and Canada. The nine agreements in Mexico are renegotiated annually. If we are unable to renegotiate acceptable\ncollective bargaining agreements with these labor unions in the future, we could experience, among other things, strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns by our workers and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages, health care costs or benefits paid to our employees. An inability to maintain good relations with our workforce could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain effective quality control systems at our mining, processing and production facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations.\nThe performance, quality and safety of our products are critical to the success of our business. These factors depend significantly on the effectiveness of our quality control systems, which, in turn, depends on a number of factors, including the design of our quality control systems, our quality-training program and our ability to ensure that our employees adhere to the quality control policies and guidelines. Any significant failure or deterioration of our quality control systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nSevere weather conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by weather conditions. Severe weather conditions may affect our customers\u2019 operations, thus reducing their need for our products. Weather conditions may impact our operations, resulting in weather-related damage to facilities and equipment or an inability to deliver equipment, personnel and products to job sites in accordance with contract schedules. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) has stated that climate change may lead to the increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events. Any such interference with our operations could force the company to delay or curtail services and potentially breach our contractual obligations or result in a loss of productivity and an increase in operating costs.\nIn addition, severe winter weather conditions impact our operations by causing us to halt our excavation and wet plant related production activities at many of our facilities during the winter months. At such facilities, during non-winter months, we excavate excess sand to build a washed sand stockpile that feeds the dry plant, which continues to operate during the winter months. Unexpected winter conditions (e.g., if winter conditions arrive earlier or last longer than expected) may result in us not having a sufficient sand stockpile to supply feedstock for our dry plant during winter months, which could result in us being unable to meet our contracted sand deliveries during such time and lead to a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nOur sales and profitability fluctuate on a seasonal basis and are affected by a variety of other factors.\nOur sales and profitability are affected by a variety of factors, including actions of competitors, changes in general economic conditions, weather conditions, variability of demand impacting fixed cost leverage and seasonal periods. As a result, our results of operations may fluctuate on a quarterly basis and relative to corresponding periods in prior years, and any of these factors could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to decline. For example, we sell more of our products in the second and third quarters to customers who operate in the Industrial segment due to the seasonal rise in construction driven by more favorable weather conditions. We sell fewer of our products in the first and fourth quarters due to reduced construction and recreational activity largely as a result of adverse weather conditions. Any unanticipated decrease in demand for our products during the second and third quarters could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.\nWe may be subject to interruptions or failures in our information technology systems. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nWe rely on sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure to process transactions, summarize our operating results and manage our business. Our information technology systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attack or other security breaches, catastrophic events, such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our employees. If our information technology systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them, and we may suffer loss of critical data, interruptions or delays in our operations and become subject to negative publicity. The reliability and capacity of our information technology systems is critical to our operations and the implementation of our growth initiatives. Any material disruption in our information technology systems, or delays or difficulties in implementing or integrating new systems or enhancing current systems, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur information technologies, systems and networks, and those of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information (including information we collect and retain in connection with our business about our business partners and employees), or other disruption of business operations, and require us to incur significant expense (that we may not be able to recover in whole or in part from our service providers or responsible parties, or their or our insurers) to address and remediate or otherwise resolve. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. Our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient. The unintended and/or unauthorized public disclosure or the misappropriation of proprietary, personal identifying or confidential information may also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals and/or business partners and/or by regulators, and the outcome of such proceedings, which could include losses, penalties, fines, injunctions, expenses and charges recorded against our earnings, could have a material and adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and harm our reputation. In addition, the costs of maintaining adequate protection against such threats, based on considerations of their evolution, increasing sophistication, pervasiveness and frequency and/or increasingly demanding government-mandated standards or obligations regarding information security and privacy, could be material to our consolidated financial statements in a particular period or over various periods.\nWe believe that there is a significant risk that we will be considered a \u201cUnited States Real Property Holding Corporation\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nWe believe there is a significant risk that we will be considered a \u201cUnited States Real Property Holding Corporation\u201d (a \u201cUSRPHC\u201d) within the meaning of Section 897 of the Code.\nIf we are a USRPHC, a non-U.S. holder may be subject to the FIRPTA Tax (as defined herein) on a future sale or other disposition of our common stock. For a detailed discussion of the FIRPTA Tax, non-U.S. holders should read the discussion in the section entitled \u201cMaterial United States Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Transaction\u201d in our Amendment No. 2 to Form S-4 Registration Statement as filed with the SEC on April 23, 2018 (the \u201cForm S-4\u201d), particularly the section entitled \u201cU.S. Federal Income Taxation of Holding Combined Company Common Stock - FIRPTA Tax in respect of combined company common stock.\u201d\nOur international operations expose us to risks inherent in doing business abroad.\nWe conduct business in many parts of the world, including Argentina, Mexico and Canada. Our international operations are subject to the various laws and regulations of those respective countries as well as various risks peculiar to each country, which may include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nglobal economic conditions;\n\u2022\npolitical actions and requirements of national governments, including trade restrictions, embargoes, seizure, detention, nationalization and expropriations of assets;\n\u2022\nchanges in and interpretation of tax statutes and requirements of taxing authorities worldwide, routine examination by taxing authorities and assessment of additional taxes, penalties and/or interest;\n\u2022\nwar, civil unrest, riots and insurrections;\n\u2022\nacts of terrorism;\n\u2022\ncriminal activities, including activities of drug cartels;\n\u2022\nthe potential for the expropriation and nationalization of mines and other assets;\n\u2022\ndevaluations and other fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nthe impact of inflation;\n\u2022\nchanges in trade agreements, tariffs and other trade protection measures;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on foreign investments;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in repatriating foreign currency received in excess of the local currency requirements; and\n\u2022\nweak intellectual property protection.\nWe are currently subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practice Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other antibribery legislation and regulations applicable in other countries. Our ability to comply with the FCPA and other anti-bribery legislation is dependent on the success of our ongoing compliance program, including our ability to continue to manage agents and business partners, and supervise, train and retain competent employees. We could be subject to sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution as well as fines and penalties in the event of a finding of a violation of the FCPA by us or any of our employees.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the U.S. or other countries in which we operate could adversely affect the U.S. and global economies and could prevent us from meeting financial and other obligations. We could experience loss of business, delays or defaults in payments from payors or disruptions of fuel supplies and markets if pipelines, production facilities, processing facilities or refineries are direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war. Such activities could reduce the overall demand for oil and gas, which, in turn, could also reduce the demand for our products and services. Terrorist activities and the threat of potential terrorist activities and any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect our results of operations, impair our ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely impact our ability to realize certain business strategies.\nWe may incur substantial product liability exposure due to the use or misuse of our products, and product liability insurance may be insufficient to cover claims against us.\nOur business exposes us to potential liability risks as a result of the use or misuse of our products. We may face liability to distributors and customers and could also face substantial liability for damages if the ultimate end use of our products causes harm to consumers and other users. Any such failures or defects could affect our relationships with distributors and customers, harm our reputation in the market and have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if any judgments or liabilities are material in size, we may be unable to satisfy such liabilities. It is possible that widespread product liability claims could increase our costs and adversely affect revenues and operating income. Moreover, liability claims arising from a serious adverse event may increase our costs through higher insurance premiums and deductibles and may make it more difficult to secure adequate insurance coverage in the future. In addition, our product liability insurance may fail to cover future product liability claims, thereby requiring us to pay substantial monetary damages and adversely affecting our business.\nThe increasing cost of employee healthcare may have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nThe cost of providing healthcare coverage for employees is becoming an increasingly significant operating cost for many companies. If healthcare costs continue to increase at a rapid pace, we may not pass on these costs to employees. Therefore, if we are unable to offset rising healthcare costs through improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures, the increased costs of employee healthcare may have an adverse effect on our profitability and operating results.\nRisks Related to Environmental, Mining, and Other Regulation\nWe and our customers are subject to extensive environmental and health and safety regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities. In addition, future regulations, or more stringent enforcement of existing regulations, could increase those costs and liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations applicable to the mining and mineral processing industry, including without limitation, laws and regulations relating to employee health and safety, environmental permitting and licensing, air and water emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, waste management, remediation of soil and groundwater contamination, land use, reclamation and restoration of properties, hazardous materials and natural resources. Some environmental laws impose substantial penalties for noncompliance, and others, such as the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d or the \u201cSuperfund Law\u201d), impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances. Liability under CERCLA, or similar state, provincial and local laws in the jurisdictions where we operate, may be imposed as a result of conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Failure to properly handle, transport, store or dispose of hazardous materials or otherwise conduct operations in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations could expose us to liability for governmental penalties, cleanup costs and civil or criminal liability associated with releases of such materials into the environment, damages to property or natural resources and other damages, as well as potentially impair our ability to conduct our operations. In addition, future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or extract mineral reserves or could require us to modify operations, acquire costly equipment or incur other significant expenses in connection with our\nbusiness. Future events, including changes in any environmental laws or regulations (or their interpretation or enforcement) and the costs associated with complying with such requirements, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may cause governmental authorities to take actions that could adversely impact our operations and financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nissuance of administrative, civil and criminal penalties;\n\u2022\ndenial, modification or revocation of permits or other authorizations;\n\u2022\nimposition of injunctive obligations or other limitations on our operations, including cessation of operations; and\n\u2022\nrequirements to perform site investigatory, remedial or other corrective actions.\nMoreover, environmental requirements, and the interpretation and enforcement thereof, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, greenhouse gas emission regulation is becoming more rigorous. We are currently subject to greenhouse gas reporting obligations with respect to operations in Calera, Alabama and expect to be required to report annual greenhouse gas emissions from operations at other facilities to the EPA, and additional greenhouse gas emission related requirements at the supranational, federal, state, regional, provincial and local levels are in various stages of development. In addition, we are required to annually calculate greenhouse gas emissions for operations in Nephton, Ontario and St. Canut, Quebec in Canada and Canoitas and Jaltiplan in Mexico. The U.S. Congress has considered, and may adopt in the future, various legislative proposals to address climate change, including a nationwide limit on greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the EPA has issued regulations, including the \u201cTailoring Rule,\u201d that subject greenhouse gas emissions from certain stationary sources to the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. Any such regulations in the U.S., Canada or Mexico could require us to modify existing permits or obtain new permits, implement additional pollution control technology, curtail operations or significantly increase operating costs. Any regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, including, for example, through a cap-and trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, reporting requirement or other program, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, reputation, operating performance and product demand.\nWe may not be able to comply with any new laws and regulations that are adopted, and any new laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results by requiring us to modify our operations or equipment or shut down some or all of our facilities. Additionally, our customers may not be able to comply with any new laws and regulations, and any new laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our customers by requiring them to shut down old facilities or to relocate facilities to locations with less stringent regulations farther away from our facilities. We cannot, at this time, reasonably estimate our costs of compliance or the timing of any costs associated with any new laws and regulations or any material adverse effect that any new standards will have on our customers and, consequently, on our operations.\nWe are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and other laws and regulations which impose stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of our operations.\nOur operations are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended by the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, and the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. These statutes and the regulations adopted pursuant thereto impose stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of mineral extraction and processing operations, including the training of personnel, operating procedures, operating equipment and other matters. We are subject to laws and regulations relating to human exposure to respirable crystalline silica. Several federal and state regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Mining Safety and Health Administration (\u201cMSHA\u201d) and OSHA, may continue to propose changes in their regulations regarding workplace exposure to respirable crystalline silica, such as permissible exposure limits and required controls and personal protective equipment. For example, in June 2016, OSHA adopted regulations that reduced permissible exposure limits to 50 micrograms of respirable crystalline silica per cubic meter of air, averaged over an eight-hour day. Both the North American Industrial Minerals Association and the National Industrial Sand Association track silicosis related issues and work with government policymakers in crafting such regulations. Our failure to comply with such laws, regulations and standards, or changes in such laws, regulations and standards or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or otherwise impose significant restrictions on our ability to conduct mineral extraction and processing operations.\nSilica-related health issues and litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations.\nThe inhalation of respirable crystalline silica can lead to the lung disease silicosis. There is evidence of an association between respirable silica exposure and lung cancer as well as a possible association with other diseases, including immune system disorders such as scleroderma. These health risks have been, and may continue to be, a significant issue confronting the silica industry. Concerns over silicosis and other potential adverse health effects, as well as concerns regarding potential liability from the use of silica, may have the effect of discouraging our customers\u2019 use of silica products. The actual or perceived health risks of mining, processing and handling silica could materially and adversely affect silica producers, including us, through reduced use of silica products, the threat of product liability or employee lawsuits, increased scrutiny by federal, state and local regulatory authorities of us and our customers, or reduced financing sources available to the silica industry.\nWe and/or our predecessors have been named as a defendant, usually among many defendants, in numerous products liability lawsuits alleging damages caused by silica exposure, mostly brought by or on behalf of current or former employees of their customers. As of December 31, 2018, there were 76 active silica-related products liability claims pending in which we are a defendant. During the year ended December 31, 2018, 13 plaintiffs\u2019 claims against us were dismissed. Many of the claims pending against us arise out of the alleged use of silica products in foundries or as an abrasive blast media and have been filed in the states of Ohio and Mississippi, although cases have been brought in many other jurisdictions over the years. In accordance with our insurance obligations, these claims are being defended by our subsidiaries\u2019 insurance carriers, subject to our payment of a percentage of the defense costs. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. Substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do sometimes occur. As a result, we could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing and the potential for related litigation could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays for our customers, which could cause a decline in the demand for sand-based proppants and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our business supplies frac sand to hydraulic fracturing operators in the oil and natural gas industry. Although we do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing activities, our customers purchase frac sand from us for use in their hydraulic fracturing operations. Hydraulic fracturing is a widely used industry production technique that is used to recover natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals, under pressure, into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production.\nThe hydraulic fracturing process has historically been regulated by state or local governmental authorities. However, the practice of hydraulic fracturing has become controversial in some areas and is undergoing increased scrutiny. Several federal agencies, regulatory authorities and legislative entities are investigating the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing and whether additional regulation may be necessary. The EPA has asserted limited federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing and has indicated it may seek to further expand its regulation of hydraulic fracturing. The Bureau of Land Management has proposed regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing conducted on federal and Indian oil and gas leases. The U.S. Congress has from time to time considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing.\nIn addition, various state, local and foreign governments have implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permitting requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain areas such as environmentally sensitive watersheds. For example, Vermont and New York banned hydraulic fracturing in 2012 and 2015, respectively. A number of local municipalities across the U.S. have instituted measures temporarily or permanently banning or otherwise limiting or delaying hydraulic fracturing in their jurisdictions. Such moratoriums and bans could make it more difficult to conduct hydraulic fracturing operations and increase our customers\u2019 cost of doing business, which could negatively impact demand for our frac sand products. In addition, new OSHA rules regulating certain aspects of the use of silica in the hydraulic fracturing industry and becoming effective in 2021 will increase costs for companies in the hydraulic fracturing industry by compelling them to meet the same standards for employees that we currently satisfy. A number of states, including the major oil and gas producing states of North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas and West Virginia, have also enacted legislation or issued regulations that impose various disclosure requirements on hydraulic fracturing operators. The availability of information regarding the constituents of hydraulic fracturing fluids could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate individual or class action legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater and drinking water supplies or otherwise cause harm to human health or the environment. Moreover, disclosure to third parties or to the public, even if inadvertent, of our customers\u2019 proprietary\nchemical formulas could diminish the value of those formulas and result in competitive harm to such customers, which could indirectly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we do not conduct hydraulic fracturing, the adoption of new laws or regulations at the federal, state, local or foreign levels imposing reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting or delaying, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete oil and natural gas wells, increase our customers\u2019 costs of compliance and doing business and otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic fracturing services they perform, which could negatively impact demand for our sand-based proppants. In addition, heightened political, regulatory and public scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing practices, including nuisance lawsuits, could expose us or our customers to increased legal and regulatory proceedings, which could be time-consuming, costly or result in substantial legal liability or significant reputational harm. We could be directly affected by adverse litigation involving the company or indirectly affected if the cost of compliance limits the ability of its customers to operate. Such costs and scrutiny could directly or indirectly, through reduced demand for our sand-based proppants, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and our customers are subject to other extensive regulations, including licensing, plant and wildlife protection and reclamation regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities. In addition, future regulations, or more stringent enforcement of existing regulations, could increase those costs and liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition to the regulatory matters described above, we and our customers are subject to extensive governmental regulation on matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, wetlands protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed. Our future success depends, among other things, on the quantity of our mineral reserves and our ability to extract these reserves profitably and customers being able to operate their businesses as they currently do.\nIn order to obtain permits and renewals of permits in the future, we may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to the impact that any proposed exploration or production activities, individually or in the aggregate, may have on the environment. Certain approval procedures may require preparation of archaeological surveys, endangered species studies and other studies to assess the environmental impact of new sites or the expansion of existing sites. Compliance with these regulatory requirements is expensive and significantly lengthens the time needed to develop a site. Finally, obtaining or renewing required permits is sometimes delayed or prevented due to community opposition, including nuisance lawsuits, and other factors beyond our control. The denial of a permit essential to our operations or the imposition of conditions with which it is not practicable or feasible to comply could impair or prevent our ability to develop or expand a site. New legal requirements, including those related to the protection of the environment, or the identification of certain species as \u201cthreatened\u201d or \u201cendangered\u201d could be adopted that could materially adversely affect our mining operations (including our ability to extract mineral reserves), our cost structure or our customers\u2019 ability to use sand-based proppants. Such current or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and we may not be able to obtain or renew permits in the future.\nOur inability to acquire, maintain or renew financial assurances related to the reclamation and restoration of mining property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are generally obligated to restore property in accordance with regulatory standards and our approved reclamation plan after it has been mined. We are required under federal, state and local laws to maintain financial assurances, such as surety bonds, to secure such obligations. The inability to acquire, maintain or renew such assurances, as required by federal, state and local laws, could subject Covia to fines and penalties as well as the revocation of operating permits. Such inability could result from a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe lack of availability, higher expense or unreasonable terms of such financial assurances;\n\u2022\nthe ability of current and future financial assurance counterparties to increase required collateral; and\n\u2022\nthe exercise by financial assurance counterparties of any rights to refuse to renew the financial assurance instruments.\nOur inability to acquire, maintain or renew necessary financial assurances related to the reclamation and restoration of mining property could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness and pension obligations could adversely affect our financial flexibility and competitive position.\nIn connection with the Merger, we completed a debt refinancing transaction, with Barclays Bank PLC as administrative agent, by entering into the Term Loan\u201d) the Revolver. The proceeds of the Term Loan were used to repay the indebtedness of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol and to pay the cash portion of the Merger consideration and expenses related to the Merger. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $1.64 billion outstanding on the Term Loan and $188.3 million of borrowing capacity on the Revolver. See Note 11 in our consolidated financial statements included in this Report for further detail.\nWe also have significant pension obligations. As of December 31, 2018, the underfunded amount of our pension plans was approximately $41.5 million. We also contribute to several multi-employer pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements. Approximately 7% of our current U.S. employees participate in such multiemployer plans. In 2018, our total contributions to our pension plans were approximately $11.5 million. Fairmount Santrol previously participated in a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan. Fairmount Santrol withdrew from the plan in October 2015 and recorded a liability of approximately $9.3 million as of December 31, 2016, which is payable in annual installments until November 2035, and has a net present value of $4.4 million at December 31, 2018.\nOur indebtedness and pension obligations could have important consequences and significant effects on our business. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to making payments on our indebtedness and pension obligations, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from exploiting business opportunities;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations, including payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and fewer pension obligations; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, railcar or other future purchase commitments, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general corporate purposes.\nIn addition, we have exposure to increases in interest rates under our debt, which will accrue interest at variable rates. As a result of this variable interest rate debt, our financial condition could be adversely affected by increases in interest rates.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants and substantial restrictions that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nThe agreements that govern our indebtedness contain, and any future financing agreements we may enter into will likely contain, operating and financial restrictions and covenants that may restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in, expand or pursue business activities. These covenants include, among other things, limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, the incurrence of liens, investments, asset sales, affiliate transactions, repurchases of equity securities, the declaration and payment of dividends, and mergers, consolidations and other fundamental transactions. In addition, the Revolver includes a total net debt covenant, to be tested on a quarterly basis, of no more than 4.0:1:0.\nOur ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flow from operations and events or circumstances beyond our control. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If we violate any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests the debt agreements, a significant portion of our indebtedness may become immediately due and payable and the lenders\u2019 commitment to make further loans to us may terminate. We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. Even if we could obtain alternative financing, that financing may not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. In addition, our obligations under the agreements governing our indebtedness will be secured by substantially all of our assets, and if we are unable to repay our indebtedness under these agreements, the lenders could seek to foreclose on our assets and could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding or liquidation proceeding against the collateral.\nChanges in the method by which LIBOR rates are determined could impact our interest payments for loans under our Term Loan and our Revolver.\nActions by the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration (\u201cICE\u201d), regulators or law enforcement agencies may result in changes to the manner in which London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) is determined or the establishment of alternative reference rates. For example, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) announced that it will no longer compel or persuade banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. The FCA announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis is not guaranteed after 2021. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes, any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the United Kingdom, the U.S., or elsewhere. Any changes announced by the ICE, the FCA, other regulators or any other successor governance or oversight body, or future changes adopted by such body, in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR rates are determined may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in the reported LIBOR rates. Loans under our Term Loan and Revolver bear interest at either LIBOR or a base rate, at the borrower\u2019s election, plus a spread determined by our leverage ratio. If a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in the reported LIBOR rates were to occur, the level of interest payments for loans under our Term Loan or Revolver may be affected.\nWe may need to incur substantial additional debt in the future in order to maintain or increase production levels and to otherwise pursue our business plan. We may not be able to borrow funds successfully or, if we can, this debt may impair our ability to operate our business.\nA significant amount of capital expenditures will be required to grow our production capacity. If prices for the products we produce decline for an extended period of time, the costs of acquisition and development opportunities increase substantially or other events occur which reduce our sales or increase our costs, we may be required to borrow in the future to enable us to finance anticipated capital expenditures and other growth opportunities. The cost of the borrowings and our obligations to repay the borrowings could have important consequences because:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\ncovenants contained in our existing and future credit and debt arrangements may require us to meet financial tests that may affect flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business, including possible acquisition opportunities;\n\u2022\nwe will need to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow to make principal and interest payments on indebtedness, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities; and\n\u2022\nour debt level makes us more vulnerable than less leveraged competitors to competitive pressures or a downturn in business or the economy generally.\nOur ability to service our indebtedness will depend on, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to generate cash flows in order to service current or future indebtedness, we would be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments and/or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional equity capital or bankruptcy protection. We may not be able to effect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms or at all.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nWe will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the Merger and the integration of businesses.\nWe have incurred material non-recurring expenses in connection with the Merger. We many incur additional unanticipated costs in integrating the businesses of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol. We cannot be certain that the elimination of duplicative costs or the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses will offset the transaction and coordination costs in the near term or at all.\nThere are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that are being integrated in connection with the Merger. While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred in connection with the Merger, there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount of, or the timing of, anticipated expenses with respect to the integration and implementation of the combined businesses.\nThere may also be additional unanticipated significant costs in connection with the Merger that we may not recoup. These costs and expenses could reduce the benefits and additional income we expect to achieve from the Merger. Although we expect that the benefits of the Merger will offset the transaction expenses and integration costs over time, no assurance can be given that any benefits will be achieved in the near term, if at all.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger.\nThe success of the Merger depends on, among other things, our ability to combine the Unimin and Fairmount Santrol businesses in a manner that realizes anticipated synergies and meets or exceeds the projected stand-alone cost savings and revenue growth trends anticipated by each company. We expect to benefit from significant synergies, including integrating and optimizing supply chains in order to reduce logistics costs, improve mine yields, decrease cycle times of the combined rail fleet and optimize our footprint. In the longer term, we will evaluate applying Fairmount Santrol\u2019s coating technologies to other minerals and applications in industries we serve, advancing our collective dust control technologies, growing Fairmount Santrol\u2019s blending businesses across Unimin\u2019s assets and geographies and leveraging the best operational and commercial excellence programs. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, or the cost to achieve these synergies is greater than expected, then the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.\nIf we are not able to realize the anticipated savings and synergies in a timely manner without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. A variety of factors may adversely affect our ability to realize the currently expected operating synergies, savings and other benefits of the Merger, including failing to successfully optimize our facilities footprint, take advantage of our supply chain, identify and eliminate duplicative programs and otherwise integrate Fairmount Santrol\u2019s and Unimin\u2019s respective businesses.\nAs a result of the Merger, branding or rebranding initiatives may involve substantial costs and may not be favorably received by customers.\nWe may incur substantial costs in rebranding our products and services, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain brand name recognition or status under the Covia brand that is comparable to the recognition and status previously enjoyed by Unimin and Fairmount Santrol separately. The failure of any such rebranding initiative could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, which could cause us not to realize some or all of the expected benefits of the Merger.\nAn impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe recorded goodwill as a result of the Merger, and other intangible assets were recorded as a result of the purchase price allocation performed in connection with the Merger. Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, or more often if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred. Other intangible assets with a finite life are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever there is an indication of impairment. Impairment charges may be incurred in the future, which could be significant and which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Investing in and Ownership of Our Common Stock\nFuture sales or issuances of our common stock, including sales by Sibelco, could have a negative impact on our common stock price.\nSibelco owns, directly or indirectly, approximately 66% of our common stock. Sales of our common stock by Sibelco or the perception that sales may be made by Sibelco could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, even if Sibelco does not sell a large number of shares of our common stock into the market, its right to transfer such shares may depress the stock price of our common stock.\nPursuant to the terms and conditions of a Registration Rights Agreement, Sibelco is entitled to registration rights with respect to the shares of our common stock it owns. These registration rights include the right to demand that its shares be registered, the right to choose the method by which its shares of common stock are distributed, a choice as to the underwriter and registration rights in conjunction with other registered offerings by us. Expenses incident to our performance of or compliance with a demand registration made by Sibelco will be borne by us. If Sibelco exercises its registration rights, the market price of shares of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, Sibelco is party to the Stockholders Agreement that was effective upon the closing of the Merger by and among Sibelco, Unimin and the other stockholders named therein (\u201cStockholders Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which Sibelco is subject to certain transfer restrictions. In particular, for three years following the effective time, Sibelco will not, and will cause its controlled affiliates not to, transfer or agree to transfer any of our common stock or other shares of capital stock to any person (other than an affiliate of Sibelco) or group if such person or group would, following such transfer, beneficially own in excess of (i) 15% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our voting stock or (ii) 50% of the voting power of our outstanding shares of voting stock, unless such person agrees to make an offer to purchase all shares of our common stock held by our stockholders for the same consideration and on substantially the same terms and conditions.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Sibelco can transfer shares of our common stock at any time (i) to any wholly owned affiliate of Sibelco who signs a joinder to the Stockholders Agreement, (ii) pursuant to a public offering of shares of our common stock (including pursuant to spin-off or split-off transactions or related actions involving a person holding Sibelco\u2019s interest in us) or (iii) in connection with a change of control of Sibelco. A change of control of Sibelco means (i) the acquisition by any other person, directly or indirectly, of record or beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the total voting securities of Sibelco, (ii) the acquisition by any other person of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of Sibelco or (iii) the acquisition by any other person of the ability to vote or direct the voting securities of Sibelco for the election of a majority of Sibelco\u2019s directors.\nSibelco will exercise significant influence over us, and its interests in us may be different than yours.\nSibelco beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, approximately 66% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. In addition, pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, Sibelco has certain preemptive rights pursuant to which it will be able to purchase its pro rata portion of any new securities that we may, from time to time, propose to issue or sell to any person, with certain exceptions. Accordingly, subject to applicable law and the limitations set forth in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and the Stockholders Agreement, Sibelco is able to exercise significant influence over our business policies and affairs, including any action requiring the approval of our stockholders, including the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the approval of a merger or sale of all or substantially all of our assets.\nSubject to the limitations included in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and the Stockholders Agreement, the directors nominated by Unimin in connection with the Merger will have significant authority to effect decisions affecting our capital structure, including the issuance of additional capital stock, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the implementation of stock repurchase programs and the decision of whether or not to declare dividends. In addition, we entered into a Contribution Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Distribution Agreements, Agency Agreements and Non-Compete Agreement with Sibelco, which are discussed in the section entitled \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions - Relationship with Sibelco\u201d in the Form S-4.\nThe interests of Sibelco may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. For example, Sibelco may support certain long-term strategies or objectives for us that may not be accretive to our stockholders in the short term. The concentration of ownership may also delay, defer or even prevent a change in control of us, even if such a change in control would benefit our other stockholders, and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of Sibelco. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with stockholders who own significant percentages of a company\u2019s outstanding stock. In addition, sales by Sibelco of shares of our common stock in the market, or the perception that Sibelco might sell shares in the market, or the fact that a large portion of our common stock is not part of the public float, could have an adverse effect on the trading market for our common stock.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE and, as a result, qualify for, and may rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nIn addition to the consequences of the concentration of share ownership and possible conflicts between the interests of Sibelco and your interests discussed above, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE. Under these rules, a company in which over 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, a group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and is not required to have:\n\u2022\na majority of its board of directors be independent directors;\n\u2022\na nominating/corporate governance committee or a compensation committee, or to have such committees be composed entirely of independent directors; and\n\u2022\nthe compensation of our Chief Executive Officer be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a compensation committee comprised of independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on the board of directors.\nWe may rely on certain of these exemptions. Accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE without regard to the exemptions available for \u201ccontrolled companies,\u201d and our status as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock.\nWe currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and our debt agreements place certain restrictions on our ability to do so. Consequently, unless there is a change to our dividend policy, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates.\nWe do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our Board and will be dependent on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, earnings, legal requirements, including limitations under Delaware law, restrictions in our debt agreements that limit our ability to pay dividends to stockholders and other factors our Board deems relevant. If our Board decides to declare dividends in the future, it may, in its sole discretion, change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely. For these reasons, you will not be able to rely on dividends to receive a return on your investment. Accordingly, realization of a gain on your shares of our common stock will likely depend solely on the appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur.\nOur certificate of incorporation contains a provision renouncing our interest and expectancy in certain corporate opportunities.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we renounce any interest or expectancy we may have in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, business opportunities that are from time to time presented to Sibelco or any of Sibelco\u2019s officers, directors, agents, members, affiliates and subsidiaries (other than us) (each, a \u201cSpecified Party\u201d), or business opportunities in which a Specified Party participates or desires to participate, even if the opportunity is one that we might reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so. In addition, each such Specified Party has no duty to communicate or offer such business opportunity to us and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, will not be liable to us or any of our stockholders for a breach of any fiduciary or other duty, as a director or officer or controlling stockholder or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such Specified Party pursues or acquires such business opportunity, directs such business opportunity to another person or fails to present such business opportunity, or information regarding such business opportunity, to us.\nAs a result of this provision, any of our directors who also serves as a director, officer or employee of Sibelco or any of Sibelco\u2019s subsidiaries or affiliates may pursue certain acquisitions or other opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, such acquisition or other opportunities may not be available to us. These potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations if attractive corporate opportunities are allocated by Sibelco to itself or its subsidiaries or affiliates instead of us.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control or a change in management, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. Therefore, these provisions could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Among other things, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u2022\npermit our Board to issue up to 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as it may designate (including preferences over our common stock);\n\u2022\nprovide that, except as otherwise provided in the Stockholders Agreement, the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution adopted by a majority of our Board, subject to the rights of holders of any series of preferred stock;\n\u2022\nprovide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise provided in the Stockholders Agreement or required by law and subject to the rights of holders of preferred stock as designated from time to time, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u2022\nrequire that any action to be taken by our stockholders following the Trigger Date (as defined therein) must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of our stockholders and not be taken by written consent;\n\u2022\nprovide that any of our stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of our stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of our stockholders must provide notice in writing in a timely manner and also specify requirements as to the form and content of such stockholder\u2019s notice;\n\u2022\nprovide that special meetings of our stockholders following the Trigger Date may be called only by our Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of directors that we would have if there were no vacancies;\n\u2022\nprovide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain legal proceedings; and\n\u2022\nprovide that our Board always has the power to make, rescind, alter, amend and repeal our bylaws and that, following the Trigger Date, the bylaws may be adopted, altered, amended or repealed by the holders of our common stock only upon the approval of at least 662/3% of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of our common stock.\nAdditionally, Delaware General Corporation Law provides that stockholders are not entitled to the right to cumulative votes in the election of directors unless a corporation\u2019s certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Our certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors.", "PERMNO": 17796, "SIC": 1400, "TIC": "CVIAQ"}
