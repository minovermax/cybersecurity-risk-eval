RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a number of very significant risks. You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties in addition to other information in this report in evaluating our Company and its business before purchasing our securities. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed as a result of the occurrence of any of the following risks. You could lose all or part of your investment due to any of these risks.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nBecause we have a limited operating history in the functional beverage markets, our ability to fully and successfully develop our business is unknown.\nWe acquired the b\u00facha\u00ae Live Kombucha brand and the assets related to the production and sale of it on April 1, 2015. Therefore, we have a limited operating history from which investors can evaluate our business. Our ability to successfully develop our products, and to realize consistent, meaningful revenues and profit has not been established and cannot be assured. For us to achieve success, our products must receive broad market acceptance by consumers. Without this market acceptance, we will not be able to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business operation. If our products are not widely accepted by the market, our business may fail.\nOur ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to generate revenues, manage development costs and expenses, and compete successfully with our direct and indirect competitors. We anticipate operating losses in upcoming future periods. This will occur because there are expenses associated with the development, production, marketing, and sales of our product.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We had an accumulated deficit of $3,331,878 and $4,863,782 as of December 31, 2015 (Successor) and 2014 (Predecessor), respectively, had net losses of $1,031,311, $72,022 and $891,435 for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 (Successor), for the three months ended March 31, 2015 (Predecessor) and for the year ended 2014 (Predecessor), respectively, and had negative working capital of $45,138 as of December 31, 2015. These matters, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWhile we are attempting to increase sales and generate additional revenues, our cash position may not be significant enough to support our daily operations. If we are unable to obtain additional financing through the issuance of debt or equity, we may be unable to continue as a going concern. While management believes in the viability of its strategy to generate additional revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nWe will need additional funds to produce, market, and distribute our products.\nWe will have to spend additional funds to produce, market and distribute our b\u00facha\u00ae Live Kombucha product line. If we cannot raise sufficient capital, we may have to cease operations and you could lose your investment. We will need additional funds to produce our product for distribution to our target markets. Even after we have produced our product, we will have to spend substantial funds on distribution, marketing and sales efforts before we will know if we have commercially viable and marketable/sellable products.\n- 13 -\nThere is no guarantee that sufficient sale levels will be achieved.\nThere is no guarantee that the expenditure of money on distribution and marketing efforts will translate into sufficient sales to cover our expenses and result in profits. Consequently, there is a risk that you may lose all of your investment.\nOur development, marketing, and sales activities are limited by our size.\nBecause we are small and do not have much capital, we must limit our product development, marketing, and sales activities. As such we may not be able to complete our production and business development program in a manner that is as thorough as we would like. We may not ever generate sufficient revenues to cover our operating and expansion costs and you may, therefore, lose your entire investment.\nChanges in the non-alcoholic beverage business environment and retail landscape could adversely impact our financial results.\nThe non-alcoholic beverage business environment is rapidly evolving as a result of, among other things, changes in consumer preferences, including changes based on health and nutrition considerations and obesity concerns; shifting consumer tastes and needs; changes in consumer lifestyles; and competitive product and pricing pressures. In addition, the non-alcoholic beverage retail landscape is very dynamic and constantly evolving, not only in emerging and developing markets, where modern trade is growing at a faster pace than traditional trade outlets, but also in developed markets, where discounters and value stores, as well as the volume of transactions through e-commerce, are growing at a rapid pace. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing environment and retail landscape, our share of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected.\nIntense competition and increasing competition in the commercial beverage market could hurt our business.\nThe commercial retail beverage industry, and in particular its non-alcoholic beverage segment, is highly competitive. Market participants are of various sizes, with various market shares and geographical reach, some of whom have access to substantially more sources of capital.\nWe generally compete with all ready-to-drink beverages, but more directly with healthy functional beverages, and specifically other kombucha beverages.\nWe compete indirectly with The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, Dr. Pepper/Seven Up, Cott Corporation, Campbell's, and other juice and healthy beverage companies. These companies have established market presence in the United States and offer a variety of beverages that are potential substitutes to our product. We face potential direct competition from such companies, because they have the financial resources, and access to manufacturing and distribution channels to rapidly enter the functional beverage market. We compete directly with other kombucha tea producers and brands focused on the emerging functional beverage market including: Synergy, Kevita, Health-Ade, Reed's, Kombucha Wonder Drink, Live and more than 100 other smaller local/regional competitors.\nThese companies could bolster their position in the healthy functional beverage market through development, additional expenditure and promotion to expand their offerings and distribution. Aside from Synergy, which dominates the current kombucha segment with, we believe, more than 80% market share, numerous other competitors are smaller with 2-5% share of market. Any one of these smaller competitors could gain additional funding and become a stronger competitor which would make the business proposition of growing our b\u00facha\u00ae Live Kombucha product line substantially more difficult to achieve.\nAs a result of both direct and indirect competition, our ability to successfully distribute, market and sell our product, and to gain sufficient market share in the United States to realize profits may be limited, greatly diminished, or totally diminished, which may lead to partial or total loss of your investment.\n- 14 -\nOur growth and profitability depends on the performance of third-parties and our relationship with them.\nOur distribution network and its success depend on the performance of third parties. Any non-performance or deficient performance by such parties may undermine our operations, profitability, and result in total loss to your investment. To distribute our product, we use a broker-distributor-retailer network whereby brokers represent our products to distributors and retailers who will in turn sell our product to consumers. The success of this network will depend on the performance of the brokers, distributors and retailers of this network. There is a risk that a broker, distributor, or retailer may refuse to or cease to market or carry our b\u00facha\u00ae Live Kombucha product line. There is a risk that the mentioned entities may not adequately perform their functions within the network by, without limitation, failing to distribute to sufficient retailers or positioning our product in localities that may not be receptive to our product. Furthermore, such third-parties' financial position or market share may deteriorate, which could adversely affect our distribution, marketing and sale activities. We also need to maintain good commercial relationships with third-party brokers, distributors and retailers so that they will promote and carry our product. Any adverse consequences resulting from the performance of third-parties or our relationship with them could undermine our operations, profitability and may result in total loss of your investment.\nThe loss of one or more of our major customers or a decline in demand from one or more of these customers could harm our business.\nReceivables arising from sales of our products are not collateralized. As of December 31, 2015 (Successor), three customers represented approximately 92.8% (59.0%, 22.9% and 10.9%) of accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2014 (Predecessor), four customers represented approximately 75.1% (25.4%, 24.0%, 13.5% and 12.1%) of accounts receivable.\nFor the nine months ended December 31, 2015 (Successor), three customers represented approximately 75.6% (32.7%, 24.2% and 26.0%) of total revenue. For the three months ended March 31, 2015 (Predecessor), three customers represented approximately 85.6% (30.2%, 29.4% and 26.0%) of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2014 (Predecessor), four customers represented approximately 84.5% (28.1%, 18.9%, 18.9% and 18.6%) of revenue.\nThere can be no assurance that such customers will continue to order our products in the same level or at all. A reduction or delay in orders from such customers, including reductions or delays due to market, economic or competitive conditions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nHealth benefits of kombucha are not guaranteed or proven, rather it is perceived by consumers.\nHealth benefits of our b\u00facha\u00ae Live Kombucha product line are not guaranteed and have not been proven. There is a consumer perception that drinking kombucha has beneficial health effects. Consequently, negative changes in consumers' perception of the benefits of kombucha or negative publicity surrounding kombucha may result in loss of market share or potential market share and hence loss of your investment.\nIncrease in the cost, disruption of supply or shortage of ingredients, other raw materials or packaging materials could harm our business.\nWe and our bottlers will use water, unique raw ingredients, sugar, packaging materials for bottles such as plastic and paper products. The prices for these ingredients, other raw materials and packaging materials fluctuate depending on market conditions. Substantial increases in the prices of our or our bottlers' ingredients, other raw materials and packaging materials, to the extent they cannot be recouped through increases in the prices of finished beverage products, would increase our operating costs and could reduce our profitability. Increases in the prices of our finished products resulting from a higher cost of ingredients, other raw materials and packaging materials could affect the affordability of our product and reduce sales.\n- 15 -\nAn increase in the cost, a sustained interruption in the supply, or a shortage of some of these ingredients, other raw materials, or packaging materials and containers that may be caused by a deterioration of our or our bottlers' relationships with suppliers; by supplier quality and reliability issues; or by events such as natural disasters, power outages, labor strikes, political uncertainties or governmental instability, or the like, could negatively impact our net revenues and profits.\nGross margins may not improve.\nIn addition to potential supply chain and production challenges, the improvement in gross margin via improved production processes, reduced material inputs, increased efficiency, reduced raw and packaging material inventory carrying costs, new raw and packaging material suppliers, and improved shipping costs will take time and are complex changes to architect and effectuate. We intend to explore all available options concurrent with growing revenues to increase profitability, but any delays in effectuating operational improvement may limit our ability to improve gross margins and profitability.\nChanges in laws and regulations relating to beverage containers and packaging could increase our costs and reduce demand for our products.\nWe and our bottlers intend to offer our b\u00facha\u00ae Live Kombucha product line in nonrefillable, recyclable containers in the United States. Legal requirements have been enacted in various jurisdictions in the United States requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged for the sale, marketing and use of certain nonrefillable beverage containers. Other proposals relating to beverage container deposits, recycling, ecotax and/or product stewardship have been introduced in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas, and we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at local, state and federal levels in the United States. Consumers' increased concerns and changing attitudes about solid waste streams and environmental responsibility and the related publicity could result in the adoption of such legislation or regulations. If these types of requirements are adopted and implemented on a large scale in the geographical regions in which we operate or intend to operate, they could affect our costs or require changes in our distribution model, which could reduce our net operating revenues or profitability.\nSignificant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the availability of our product may inhibit sales of affected products.\nVarious jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the availability of our product relating to the content or perceived adverse health consequences of our product. If these types of requirements become applicable to our product under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of our product.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions in the United States could negatively impact our financial performance.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown, in the United States could negatively affect the affordability of, and consumer demand for, our b\u00facha\u00ae Live Kombucha product line in the United States. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products or by shifting away from our beverages to lower-priced products offered by other companies, including non-alkaline water. Consumers may also cease purchasing bottled water and consume tap water. Lower consumer demand for our product in the United States could reduce our profitability.\n- 16 -\nAdverse weather conditions could reduce the demand for our products.\nThe sales of our b\u00facha\u00ae Live Kombucha product line is influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. Unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for our product and contribute to lower sales, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for such periods.\nChanges in, or failure to comply with, the laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could increase our costs or reduce our net operating revenues.\nThe advertising, distribution, labeling, production, safety, sale, and transportation in the United States of our product will be subject to: the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; state consumer protection laws; competition laws; federal, state, and local workplace health and safety laws, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws; and various other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. Legal requirements also apply in many jurisdictions in the United States requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged for the sale, marketing, and use of certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other types of statutes and regulations relating to beverage container deposits, recycling, ecotaxes and/or product stewardship also apply in various jurisdictions in the United States. We anticipate that additional, similar legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future at the local, state and federal levels in the United States. Changes to such laws and regulations could increase our costs or reduce our net operating revenues.\nIn addition, failure to comply with environmental, health or safety requirements and other applicable laws or regulations could result in the assessment of damages, the imposition of penalties, suspension of production, changes to equipment or processes, or a cessation of operations at our or our bottlers' facilities, as well as damage to our image and reputation, all of which could harm our profitability.\nOur b\u00facha\u00ae Live Kombucha product line is considered premium and healthy beverages and are being sold at premium prices compared to other functional beverages. We cannot provide any assurances as to consumers' continued market acceptance of our current and future products. Kombucha is a fermented tea product. With that fermentation, a trace amount of alcohol is produced, typically less than 0.5%. This trace alcohol amount allows the products to be commercialized as non-alcoholic beverages. The fact that there are trace amounts of alcohol led to consumer confusion in 2011 and 2012, which led to product recalls from various retailers. Although the manufacture of our products utilizes strict quality control processes in its production processes to keep its products at trace levels, not all kombucha products in the industry are manufactured under the same standards. In addition, other competitors, due to their different production processes, may experience secondary fermentation in their bottles, especially as their products age, which can lead to an increase in alcohol levels above the legal trace limits. Our manufacturing process precludes the risk of secondary fermentation, contributes to bottles not exploding upon opening, and leads to the longer shelf life, consistency and product quality.\nWe rely on key executive officers, and their knowledge of our business would be difficult to replace.\nOur performance is highly dependent on the performance of a few employees, including executive officers, with no backstops or replacements or succession plans. We do not have \"key person\" life insurance policies for any of our officers. The loss of management and industry expertise of any of our key executive officers could result in delays in product development, loss of any future customers and sales and diversion of management resources, which could adversely affect our operating results.\n- 17 -\nOur executive officers are not subject to supervision or review by an independent board or audit committee. Our current board of directors consists of three members, two insiders with only one independent director. As such, we do not have an independent audit committee, compensation committee or governance committee. As a result, the activities of our officers are not subject to the review and scrutiny of an independent board of directors or committees.\nRisk Related to Our Stock\nTrading on the OTCQB may be volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCQB operated by the OTC Markets Group. Trading in stock quoted on the OTCQB is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTCQB is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTCQB is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a national securities exchange like the NASDAQ or the NYSE. Accordingly, stockholders may have difficulty reselling any of our shares.\nA decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise further working capital, it may adversely impact our ability to continue operations and we may go out of business.\nA prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. Because we plan to acquire a significant portion of the funds we need in order to conduct our planned operations through the sale of equity or equity-linked securities, a decline in the price of our common stock could be detrimental to our liquidity and our operations because the decline may cause investors not to choose to invest in our stock. If we are unable to raise the funds we require for all our planned operations, we may be forced to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may suffer a significant negative effect on our business plan and operations, including our ability to develop new products and continue our current operations. As a result, our business may suffer, and not be successful and we may go out of business. We also might not be able to meet our financial obligations if we cannot raise enough funds through the sale of our equity securities and we may be forced to go out of business.\nBecause we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the near future, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them.\nWe intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the near future. The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of the board of directors, and will depend upon, among other things, the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors as the board of directors considers relevant. There is no assurance that future dividends will be paid, and if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend. Unless we pay dividends, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them.\n- 18 -\nOur stock is listed on the Over-the-Counter market. Trading of our stock may be restricted by the SEC's penny stock regulations, which may limit a stockholder's ability to buy and sell our stock.\nOur stock is a penny stock. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines \"penny stock\" to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined in Rule 15g-9) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and \"accredited investors\". The term \"accredited investor\" refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker- dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC, which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder's ability to buy and sell our stock.\nIn addition to the \"penny stock\" rules promulgated by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\"FINRA\") has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock.", "PERMNO": 16593, "SIC": 2086, "TIC": "NBEV"}
