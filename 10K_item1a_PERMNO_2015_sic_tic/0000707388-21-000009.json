If we cannot comply with these covenants, we may be in default under one or more of our loan agreements.\n\u2022We may not be entitled to forgiveness of our recently received PPP loans, and our application for the PPP loans could in the future be determined to have been impermissible.\n\u2022Substantially all of our assets (including the assets of our subsidiaries) have been pledged to lenders as security for our indebtedness under our loan agreements and our inability to comply with applicable financial covenants under the loan agreements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\n\u2022The inability of the Company or any of the Company\u2019s other subsidiaries to comply with applicable financial covenants under the Company Loan Agreements could have a material adverse effect on financial condition of the Company.\n\u2022If we are unable to generate or borrow sufficient cash to make payments on our indebtedness, our financial condition would be materially harmed, our business could fail, and stockholders may lose all of their investment.\n\u2022Increases in interest rates could adversely affect our results from operations and financial condition.\n\u2022If we fail to pay dividends on our preferred stock for six or more consecutive quarters, holders of our preferred stock will be entitled to elect two additional directors to our board of directors.\n\u2022The market price of our common stock may be volatile, and the value of your investment could decline significantly.\n\u2022Our common stock has a low trading volume and shares available under our equity compensation plans could affect the trading price of our common stock.\n\u2022Payment of dividends on our common stock is prohibited unless we have declared and paid (or set apart for payment) full accumulated dividends on our preferred stock, which also has a significant liquidation value.\n\u2022If Nasdaq delists our preferred stock from quotation on its exchange, investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in the preferred stock could be limited.\n\u2022The market for our preferred stock may not provide investors with adequate liquidity.\n\u2022Our preferred stock will bear a risk in connection with redemption. We may not be able to redeem our preferred stock upon a change of control triggering event.\n\u2022As a smaller reporting company, we are subject to scaled disclosure requirements that may make it more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.\n\u2022If we cannot continue to satisfy the Nasdaq Global Market continued listing standards and other Nasdaq rules, our common stock could be delisted, which would harm our business, the trading price of our common stock, our ability to raise additional capital and the liquidity of the market for our common stock.\n\u2022If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, the price and trading volume of our securities could decline.\n\u2022If we become a personal holding company, our results could be negatively impacted.\n\u2022Holders of the Company Preferred Stock may be unable to use the dividends-received deduction and may not be eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to \u201cqualified dividend\u201d income.\n\u2022A holder of Company Preferred Stock has extremely limited voting rights.\n\u2022Our preferred stock is not convertible into common stock, including in the event of a change of control of the Company, and investors will not realize a corresponding upside if the price of our common stock increases.\n\u2022Our cash available for dividends to holders of our preferred stock may not be sufficient to pay anticipated dividends, nor can we assure you of our ability to make dividends in the future, and we may need to borrow to make such dividends or may not be able to make such dividends at all.\n\u2022The protective amendment contained in our certificate of incorporation, which is intended to help preserve the value of certain income tax assets, primarily tax net operating loss carryforwards may have unintended negative effects.\n\u2022Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may prevent or delay removal of current management or a change in control.\n\u2022Material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could have a significant adverse effect on our business and the price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur HoldCo Conversion and related acquisitions or investments could involve unknown risks that could harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition and there can be no assurances that we will be successful as a diversified holding company.\nWe are a diversified holding company with interests in a variety of industries and market sectors. The real estate acquisitions that we have made under our SRE real estate division and the pending and future acquisitions that we consummate will involve unknown risks, some of which will be particular to the industry in which the acquisition target operates. Although we intend to conduct extensive business, financial, and legal due diligence in connection with the evaluation of all our acquisition and investment opportunities, there can be no assurance our due diligence investigations will identify every matter that could have a material adverse effect on us. We may be unable to adequately address the financial, legal, and operational risks raised by such acquisitions or investments. The realization of any unknown risks could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. In addition, our financial condition, results of operations and the ability to service our debt will be subject to the specific risks applicable to any company we acquire or in which we invest.\nPart of our strategy as a diversified holding company is to grow through the acquisition of businesses that we believe will realize a material benefit from being part of a larger holding company structure, both financially and strategically. There can be no assurances that we will find suitable acquisition targets that will enable us to successfully realize our conversion into a diversified holding company, and even if such targets are identified, there can be no assurances that we can negotiate and complete such acquisitions on attractive terms. If we succeed in making suitable acquisitions, we may not be able to obtain the expected profitability or other benefits in the short or long term from such acquisitions.\nWe rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could materially harm our business.\nWe rely on information technology and systems, including the Internet, commercially available software, and other applications, to process, transmit, store, and safeguard information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include personal identifying information and other valuable or confidential information. If we experience material failures, inadequacies, or interruptions or security failures of our information technology, we could incur material costs and losses. Further, third-party vendors could experience similar events with respect to their information technology and systems that impact the products and services they provide to us or to our customers. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring, as well as other applications and internal procedures and personnel, to provide security for processing, transmitting, storing, and safeguarding confidential information such as personally identifiable information related to our employees and others, information regarding financial accounts, and information regarding customers and vendors. We take various actions, and we incur significant costs, to maintain and protect the operation and security of our information technology and systems, including the data maintained in those systems. However, it is possible that these measures will not prevent the systems\u2019 improper functioning or a compromise in security, such as in the event of a cyberattack or the improper disclosure of information. Security breaches, computer viruses, attacks by hackers, online fraud schemes, and similar breaches can create significant system disruptions, shutdowns, fraudulent transfer of assets, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. For example, in April 2019, we became aware that we had been a victim of criminal fraud commonly referred to as \u201cbusiness email compromise fraud.\u201d The incident involved the impersonation of an officer of the Company and improper access to his email, wherein the transfer by the Company of funds to a third-party account almost occurred.\nThe operation of our healthcare business includes use of complex information technology infrastructures, access to the information technology networks of our customers, as well as the collection of storing of patient information that is subject to HIPAA. In recent years, attacks on corporate information technology infrastructures have become more common and more sophisticated. Any successful attack on our network could severely impact our ability to conduct operations and could result in lost customers. Though we carry customary insurance for notification events in the event of a patient information breach under HIPAA, our coverage may not be sufficient to cover every situation, and any notification could severely impact our customer confidence and operations.\nDespite any defensive measures we take to manage threats to our business, our risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened as new and sophisticated methods used by criminals including phishing, social engineering, or other illicit acts, may occur which we may be unable to anticipate or fail to adequately mitigate. Any failure to maintain the security, proper function and availability of our information technology and systems, or certain third-party vendors\u2019 failure to similarly protect their information technology and systems that are relevant to our operations, or to safeguard our business processes, assets, and information could result in financial losses, interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, cause us to be in default of material contracts, and subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties, any of which could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe may not be able to achieve the anticipated synergies and benefits from business acquisitions.\nPart of our business strategy is to acquire businesses that we believe can complement or expand our current business activities, both financially and strategically. On September 10, 2019, we acquired ATRM and its subsidiaries, including KBS, EdgeBuilder and Glenbrook with these synergistic benefits in mind. Acquisitions involve many complexities, including, but not limited to, risks associated with the acquired business\u2019 past activities, loss of customers, regulatory changes that are not anticipated, difficulties in integrating personnel and human resource programs, integrating ERP systems and other infrastructures, general underperformance of the business under our control versus the prior owners, unanticipated expenses and liabilities, and the impact on its internal controls of compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As a result, the realization of anticipated synergies or benefits from acquisitions may be delayed or substantially reduced, and could potentially result in the impairment of our investment in these businesses.\nWe are subject to particular risks associated with real estate ownership, which could result in unanticipated losses or expenses.\nFollowing our recent acquisition of real estate, our business is subject to many risks that are associated with the ownership of real estate. For example, if our tenants do not renew their leases or default on their leases, we may be unable to re-lease the facilities at favorable rental rates. Other risks that are associated with real estate acquisition and ownership include, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022 general liability, property and casualty losses, some of which may be uninsured;\n\u2022 the inability to purchase or sell our assets rapidly due to the illiquid nature of real estate and the real estate market;\n\u2022 leases which are not renewed or are renewed at lower rental amounts at expiration;\n\u2022 the default by a tenant or guarantor under any lease;\n\u2022costs relating to maintenance and repair of our facilities and the need to make expenditures due to changes in governmental regulations, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act or remediation of unknown environmental hazards; and\n\u2022 acts of God and act of terrorism affecting our properties.\nOur revenues may decline due to reductions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates.\nThe success of our business is largely dependent upon our medical professional customers\u2019 ability to provide diagnostic care to their patients in an economically sustainable manner, either through the purchase of our imaging systems or using our diagnostic services, or both. Our customers are directly impacted by changes (decreases and increases) in governmental and private payor reimbursements for diagnostic services. We are directly and indirectly impacted by changes in reimbursements. In our businesses, where we are indirectly affected by reimbursement changes, we make every effort to act as business partners with our physician customers. For example, in 2010, we proactively adjusted our diagnostic imaging services rates down due to the dramatic reimbursement declines that our customers experienced from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Reimbursements remain a source of concern for our customers and downward pressure on reimbursements causes greater pricing pressure on our services and influences the buying decisions of our customers. Although the gap is closing, hospital reimbursements remain higher than in-office reimbursements. Our Diagnostic Imaging segment\u2019s products are targeted to serve the hospital market. A smaller portion of our Diagnostic Services business segment operates in the hospital market.\nReductions in reimbursements could significantly impact the viability of in-office imaging performed by independent physicians, as well as the viability of our cardiac event monitoring services business. The historical decline in reimbursements in diagnostic imaging has resulted in cancellations of imaging days in our Diagnostic Services business and the delay of purchase and service decisions by our existing and prospective customers in our Diagnostic Imaging business.\nOur Diagnostic Services revenues may decline due to changes in diagnostic imaging regulations and the use of third party benefit managers by states and private payors to drive down diagnostic imaging volumes.\nNuclear medicine is a \u201cdesignated health service\u201d under the federal physician self-referral prohibition law known as the \u201cStark Law,\u201d which states that a physician may not refer designated health services to an entity with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship, unless a statutory exception applies. Our business model and service agreements are structured to enable our physician customers to meet the statutory in-office ancillary services (\u201cIOAS\u201d) exception to the Stark Law, allowing them to perform nuclear diagnostic imaging services on their patients in the convenience of their own office. From time-to-time, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Congress have proposed to modify the IOAS to further limit or eliminate this exception. Various lobbying organizations, including the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (\u201cMedPAC\u201d), in the past have pushed for, discussed, and recommended that Congress limit the availability of the IOAS exception in order to reduce federal healthcare costs. Legislation has been introduced in prior Congresses to modify or eliminate the exception, but has not been enacted. The outcome of these efforts is uncertain at this time; however, the limitation or elimination of the IOAS exception could significantly impact our Diagnostic Services business segment as currently structured.\nOur customers who perform imaging services in their office also experience the continuing efforts by some private insurance companies to reduce healthcare expenditures by hiring radiology benefit managers to help them manage and limit imaging. The federal government has also set aside monies in the 2009 recession recovery acts to hire radiology benefit managers to provide image management services to Medicare/Medicaid and MedPAC has recommended and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has, in the past, proposed legislation requiring Medicare physicians who engage in a relatively high volume of medical imaging be required to obtain pre-authorization through a radiology benefit manager. A radiology benefit manager is an unregulated entity that performs various functions for private payors and managed care organizations. Radiology benefit manager activities can include pre-authorization for imaging procedures, setting and enforcing standards, approving which contracted physicians can perform the services, such as requiring even the most experienced and highly qualified cardiologists to obtain additional board certifications, or interfering with the financial decision of the private practitioner by requiring them to own their own imaging system and not allowing them to lease the system. The radiology benefit managers often do not provide written documentation of their decisions or an appeals process, leaving leasing physicians unable to challenge their decisions with the carrier or the state insurance department. Unregulated radiology benefit manager activities have and could continue to adversely affect our physician customers\u2019 ability to receive reimbursement, therefore impacting our customers\u2019 decision to utilize our Diagnostic Services imaging services.\nOperating results may be adversely affected by changes in the costs and availability of supplies and materials.\nManufacturing and providing service for our nuclear imaging cameras is highly dependent upon the availability of certain suppliers; thereby making us vulnerable to supply problems and price fluctuations that could harm our business. Our manufacturing process within Diagnostic Imaging, and our warranty and post-warranty camera support business, rely on a limited number of third parties to supply certain key components and manufacture our products. Alternative sources of production and supply may not be readily available or may take several months to scale-up and develop effective production processes. If a disruption in the availability of parts or in the operations of our suppliers were to occur, our ability to have gamma cameras built as well as our ability to provide support could be materially adversely affected. In certain cases, we have developed backup plans and have alternative procedures should we experience a disruption. However, if these plans are unsuccessful or if we have a single source, delays in the production and support of our gamma cameras for an extended period of time could cause a loss of revenue and/or higher production and support costs, which could significantly harm our business and results of operations.\nOur Diagnostic Services operations are highly dependent upon the availability of certain radiopharmaceuticals, thereby making us vulnerable to supply problems and price fluctuations that could harm our business. Our Diagnostic Service business involves the use of radiopharmaceuticals. There is a limited number of major nuclear reactors supplying medical radiopharmaceuticals worldwide and there is no guarantee that the reactors will remain in good repair or that our supplier will have continuing access to ample supply of our radiopharmaceutical product. If we are unable to obtain an adequate supply of the necessary radiopharmaceuticals, we may be unable to utilize our personnel and equipment through our in-office service operations, or the volume of our services could decline and our business may be adversely affected. Shortages can also cause price increases that may not be accounted for in third party reimbursement rates, thereby causing us to lose margin or require us to pass increases on to our physician customers.\nOur Building and Construction operating results could be adversely affected by changes in the cost and availability of raw materials. Prices and availability of raw materials used to manufacture its products can change significantly due to fluctuations in supply and demand. Additionally, availability of the raw materials used to manufacture its products may be limited at times resulting in higher prices and/or the need to find alternative suppliers. Both KBS\u2019s and EBGL\u2019s major material components are dimensional lumber and wood sheet products, which include plywood and oriented strand board. Lumber costs are subject to market fluctuations. Furthermore, the cost of raw materials may also be influenced by transportation costs. It is not certain that any price increases can be passed on to its customers without affecting demand or that limited availability of materials will not impact its production capabilities. The state of the financial and housing markets may also impact its suppliers and affect the availability or pricing of materials. ATRM\u2019s inability to raise the price of its products in response to increases in prices of raw materials or to maintain a proper supply of raw materials could have an adverse effect on its revenue and earnings.\nOur quarterly and annual financial results are difficult to predict and are likely to fluctuate from period to period.\nWe have historically experienced seasonality in all of our businesses, volatility due to the changing healthcare environment, the variable supply of radiopharmaceuticals, and downturns based on the changing U.S. economy. While our customers are typically obligated to pay us for imaging days to which they have committed, our contracts permit some flexibility in scheduling when services are to be performed. We cannot predict with certainty the degree to which seasonal circumstances such as the summer slowdown, winter holiday vacations, and weather conditions may affect the results of our operations. We have also experienced fluctuations in demand of our diagnostic imaging product sales due to economic conditions, capital budget availability, and other financial or business reasons, most recently the abrupt increases of quarantine restrictions and reduced demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, due to the way that customers in our target markets acquire our products, a large percentage of our products are booked during the last month of each quarterly accounting period, and often there can be a large amount in the last month of the year. As such, a delivery delay of only a few days may significantly impact quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations. Moreover, the sales cycle for all of our capital products is typically lengthy, particularly in the hospital market, which may cause us to experience significant revenue fluctuations.\nWe spend considerable time and money complying with federal and state laws, regulations, and other rules which may fluctuate based on healthcare policy, and if we are unable to fully comply with such laws, regulations, and other rules, we could face substantial penalties.\nThrough our Healthcare businesses we are directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to extensive regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business, including: the federal Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback laws and other Medicare laws, regulations, rules, manual provisions, and policies that prescribe requirements for coverage and payment for services performed by us and our physician customers; the federal False Claims statutes; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended in 2009 under the HITECH Act that places direct legal obligations and higher liability on us with respect to the security and handling of personal health information; the Stark Law; the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; federal and state radioactive materials laws; state food and drug and pharmacy laws and regulations; state laws that prohibit the practice of medicine by non-physicians and fee-splitting arrangements between physicians and non-physicians; state scope-of-practice laws; and federal rules prohibiting the mark-up of diagnostic tests to Medicare under certain circumstances. If our customers are unable or unwilling to comply with these statutes, regulations, rules, and policies, rates of our services and products could decline and our business could be harmed.\nOur Building and Construction businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern numerous aspects of its business. In recent years, a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted, and there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies. These laws and regulations, and related interpretations and enforcement activity, may change as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. Changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements; the classification of exempt and non-exempt employees; the distinction between employees and contractors; other wage, labor or workplace regulations; healthcare; data protection and cybersecurity; the sale and pricing of some of its products; transportation; logistics; supply chain transparency; taxes; unclaimed property; energy costs and consumption; or environmental matters could increase its costs of doing business or impact its operations.\nWe maintain a compliance program to identify and correct any compliance issues and remain in compliance with all applicable laws, to train employees, to audit and monitor our operations, and to achieve other compliance goals. Like most companies with compliance programs, we occasionally discover compliance concerns. In such cases, we take responsive action, including corrective measures when necessary. There can be no assurance that our responsive actions will insulate us from liability associated with any detected compliance concerns.\nIf our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws, regulations, rules, or policies described above or the other laws or regulations to which we or our customers are subject, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from federal or state healthcare programs, or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Similarly, if our physician customers are found to be non-compliant with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions that could have a negative impact on us. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment, or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business, and damage our reputation. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, regulations, rules, and policies, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security, and fraud laws may prove costly.\nWe are subject to risks associated with self-insurance related to health benefits.\nTo help control our overall long-term costs associated with employee health benefits, we are self-insured up to certain limits for our health plans. As such, we are subject to risks associated with self-insurance of these health plan benefits. To limit our exposure, we have third party stop-loss insurance coverage for both individual and aggregate claim costs. However, we could still experience unforeseen and potentially significant fluctuations in our healthcare costs based on a higher than expected volume of claims below these stop-loss levels. These fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nA portion of our operations are located in a facility that may be at risk from fire, earthquakes, or other disasters.\nFinal assembly in our manufacturing process and significant portions of our inventory are located in a single facility in Poway, California, near known fire areas and earthquake fault zones. Future natural disasters could cause substantial delays in our operations and cause us to incur additional expenses. Although we have taken precautions to insure our facilities and continuing operations, as well as provide for offsite back-up of our information systems, this may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case.\nThe medical device industry is litigious, which could result in the diversion of our management\u2019s time and efforts, and require us to incur expenses and pay damages that may not be covered by our insurance.\nOur operations entail risks of claims or litigation relating to product liability, radioactive contamination, patent infringement, trade secret disclosure, warranty claims, vendor disputes, product recalls, property damage, misdiagnosis, breach of contract, personal injury, and death. Any litigation or claims against us, or claims we bring against others, may cause us to incur substantial costs, could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of our management from our core business, and harm our reputation. We may incur significant liability in the event of any such litigation, regardless of the merit of the action. If we are unable to obtain insurance, or if our insurance is inadequate to cover claims, our cash reserves and other assets could be negatively impacted. Additionally, costs associated with maintaining our insurance could become prohibitively expensive, and our ability to become or remain profitable could be diminished.\nIf we cannot provide quality technical and applications support, we could lose customers and our business and prospects will suffer.\nThe placement of our products and the introduction of our technology at new customer sites requires the services of highly trained technical support personnel. Hiring technical support personnel is very competitive in our industry due to the limited number of people available with the necessary scientific and technical backgrounds and ability to understand our technology at a technical level. If we are unable to attract, train or retain the number of highly qualified technical services personnel that our business needs, our business and prospects will suffer.\nOur long-term results depend upon our ability to improve existing products and services and develop, introduce, and market new products and services successfully.\nOur business is dependent on the continued improvement of our existing products and services and our development of new products and services utilizing our current or other potential future technology. As we introduce new products and services or refine, improve or upgrade versions of existing products and services, we cannot predict the level of market acceptance or the amount of market share these products and services will achieve, if any. We cannot assure you that we will not experience material delays in the introduction of new products or services in the future.\nWe generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. If we do not develop new products and services and product enhancements based on technological innovation on a timely basis, our products and services may become obsolete over time and our revenues, cash flow, profitability and competitive position may suffer. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new products, services and product enhancements, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer.\nWe may face risks associated with launching new products and services. If we encounter development or manufacturing challenges or discover errors during our product development cycle, the product launch dates of new products and services may be delayed. The expenses or losses associated with unsuccessful product development or launch activities or lack of market acceptance of our new products and services could adversely affect our business or financial condition.\nOur ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology through patents and other means is uncertain.\nWe rely on patent protection as well as trademark, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property rights protection and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technologies, all of which provide limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our products. If we fail to protect and/or maintain our intellectual property, third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us, we may lose our technological or competitive advantage, and/or we may incur substantial litigation costs in our attempts to recover or restrict use of our intellectual property.\nWe do not have any pending patent applications. We cannot assure investors that we will continue to innovate and file new patent applications, or that if filed any future patent applications will result in granted patents. Further, we cannot predict how long it will take for such patents to issue, if at all. It is possible that, for any of our patents that have issued or that may issue in the future, our competitors may design their products around our patented technologies. Further, we cannot assure investors that other parties will not challenge any patents granted to us, or that courts or regulatory agencies will hold our patents to be valid, enforceable, and/or infringed. We cannot guarantee investors that we will be successful in defending challenges made against our patents and patent applications. Any successful third-party challenge or challenges to our patents could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents, or such patents being interpreted narrowly and/or in a manner adverse to our interests. Our ability to establish or maintain a technological or competitive advantage over our competitors and/or market entrants may be diminished because of these uncertainties. For these and other reasons, our intellectual property may not provide us with any competitive advantage.\nTo the extent our intellectual property offers inadequate protection, or is found to be invalid or unenforceable, we would be exposed to a greater risk of direct or indirect competition. If our intellectual property does not provide adequate coverage of our competitors\u2019 products, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business.\nThe measures that we use to protect the security of our intellectual property and other proprietary rights may not be adequate, which could result in the loss of legal protection for, and thereby diminish the value of, such intellectual property and other rights or we may need to enter into costly license agreements in the future.\nIn addition to pursuing patents on our technology, we also rely upon trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or misappropriated. In addition, we take steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, corporate partners and, when needed, our advisors. Such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and/or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements, and we may not be able to prevent such unauthorized disclosure. Moreover, if a party having an agreement with us has an overlapping or conflicting obligation to a third party, our rights in and to certain intellectual property could be undermined. Monitoring unauthorized and inadvertent disclosure is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to prevent such disclosure are, or will be, adequate. If we were to enforce a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, it would be expensive and time consuming, the outcome would be unpredictable, and any remedy may be inadequate.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it would be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success also depends on our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our products and perform our services without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing products and services. As part of a business strategy to impede our successful commercialization and entry into new markets, competitors may allege that our products and/or services infringe their intellectual property rights.\nWe could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against claims of infringement made by third parties. Any adverse ruling by a court or administrative body, or perception of an adverse ruling, may have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business and our finances. Moreover, third parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive relief against us, which could block our ability to offer one or more products or services and could result in a substantial award of damages against us. Intellectual property litigation can be very expensive, and we may not have the financial means to defend ourselves.\nBecause patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be pending applications, some of which are unknown to us, that may result in issued patents upon which our products or proprietary technologies may infringe. Moreover, we may fail to identify issued patents of relevance or incorrectly conclude that an issued patent is invalid or not infringed by our technology or any of our products.\nOur issued patents could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court, at the USPTO or other administrative agency, or in other lawsuits which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nAny patents we have obtained or do obtain may be challenged by re-examination or otherwise invalidated or eventually found unenforceable. Both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive. If we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent related to one of our products or services, the defendant in such litigation could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. Third parties may also raise similar claims before the USPTO even outside the context of litigation. The outcome is unpredictable following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that no invalidating prior art existed of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. These assertions may also be based on information known to us or the USPTO. If a defendant or third party were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the claims of the challenged patent. Such a loss of patent protection would or could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nCompetitors may attempt to challenge or invalidate our patents, or may be able to design alternative techniques or devices that avoid infringement of our patents that have issued or that may issue in the future, or develop products with functionalities that are comparable to ours. In the event a competitor infringes upon our patent or other intellectual property rights, litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenge, even if successful, could be expensive and time consuming and could require significant time and attention from our management. We may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenges from others.\nAn adverse result in any such litigation proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, being found to be unenforceable, and/or being interpreted narrowly and could impact the validity or enforceability positions of our other patents. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, an adverse outcome in such litigation or proceedings may expose us to loss of our proprietary position, expose us to significant liabilities, or require us to seek licenses that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe may make financial investments in other businesses that may lose value.\nAs we look for the best ways to deploy our capital and maximize our returns for our businesses and shareholders, we may make financial investments in other businesses or processes for purposes of enhancing our supply chain, creating financial returns, strategic developments, or other purposes. These investments may be speculative in nature, and there is no guarantee that we will experience a financial return and we may lose our entire principal balance if not successful.\nWe face risks related to health pandemics and other widespread outbreaks of contagious disease, including the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, which could significantly disrupt our operations and impact our financial results.\nOur business has been disrupted and could be materially adversely affected beyond 2020 by the recent outbreak of COVID-19. The outbreak and government measures taken in response have also had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce. Global health concerns, such as coronavirus, could also result in social, economic, and labor instability in the countries in which we or the third parties with whom we engage operate. The future progression of the outbreak and its effects on our business and operations are uncertain. We cannot presently predict the scope and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions, including downturns in global economies and financial markets that could affect our future operating results. Any adverse impact on our results and financial condition could have a negative impact on our ability to comply with certain financial covenants in certain of our loan agreements (as described further below) and on your investment in our common stock.\nOur goodwill and other long-lived assets are subject to potential impairment that could negatively impact our earnings.\nA significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired. At December 31, 2020, goodwill and net intangible assets represented $26.4 million, or 29.9% of our total assets. In addition, net property, plant and equipment assets totaled $9.8 million, or 11.1% of our total assets. If actual results differ from the assumptions and estimates used in our goodwill and long-lived asset valuation calculations, we could incur impairment charges, which could negatively impact our earnings.\nWe review our reporting units for potential goodwill impairment annually or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In addition, we test the recoverability of long-lived assets if events or circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. We conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations. There are numerous risks that may cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount and/or the value of long-lived assets to not be recoverable, which could lead to the measurement and recognition of goodwill and/or long-lived asset impairment. These risks include, but are not limited to, significant negative variances between actual and expected financial results, lowered expectations of future financial results, failure to realize anticipated synergies from acquisitions, adverse changes in the business climate, and the loss of key personnel. If we are not able to achieve projected performance levels, future impairments could be possible, which could negatively impact our earnings.\nOn September 10, 2019, Star Equity completed its acquisition of ATRM pursuant to the ATRM Merger Agreement. The $8.2 million goodwill recognized is attributable primarily to expected synergies and the assembled workforce of ATRM. As of December 31, 2019, there was a subsequent measurement of goodwill that resulted in an adjustment of $3.0 thousand to the recognized amounts of goodwill resulting from the acquisition of ATRM.\nWe recorded an impairment loss of $0.4 million associated with the impairment assessment of the EBGL reporting unit as of December 31, 2020. No other significant impairment losses on long-lived assets were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2019. See Note 3. Basis of Presentation, Note 6. Merger and Note 9. Goodwill, within the notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding goodwill and long-lived assets.\nThe pending sale of DMS Health is subject to closing conditions, the failure of any of which (including failure to obtain certain approvals), could result in our inability to consummate the transaction and, consequently, adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or our stock price.\nOn October 30, 2020, we entered into the DMS Purchase Agreement to sell all of the issued and outstanding common stock of DMS Health. The purchase price for the DMS Sale Transaction is $18.75 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments, including a working capital adjustment. The completion of the DMS Sale Transaction is subject to receipt of certain consents and closing conditions.\nWe have spent time and money on the pending sale of DMS Health but we may not be able to consummate the transaction if we fail to obtain the necessary consents and approvals or to satisfy other conditions to closing. In addition, we expect to incur transaction costs in connection with the pending sale of DMS Health, whether or not the transaction is completed.\nUnder the terms of the DMS Purchase Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of DMS Health's business prior to the completion of the pending sale, which restrictions could adversely affect our ability to realize certain business strategies or take advantage of certain business opportunities. In addition, the current trading price of our common stock and the Company Preferred Stock may reflect a market assumption that the sale of DMS Health will be completed. If we are unable to consummate the sale of DMS Health, we may be unable to find another party willing to purchase DMS Health on equally favorable terms or at all. The failure to complete the sale of DMS Health may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and our stock price.\nIf KBS is unable to maintain or establish its relationships with independent dealers and contractors who sell its homes, KBS revenue could decline.\nKBS sells residential homes through a network of independent dealers and contractors. As is common in the modular home industry, KBS\u2019s independent dealers may also sell homes produced by competing manufacturers and can cancel their relationships with KBS on short notice. In addition, these dealers may not remain financially solvent, as they are subject to industry, economic, demographic and seasonal trends similar to those faced by KBS. If KBS is not able to maintain good relationships with its dealers and contractors or establish relationships with new solvent dealers or contractors, KBS\u2019s revenue could decline.\nDue to the nature of our business, many of our expenses are fixed costs and if there are decreases in demand for products, it may adversely affect operating results.\nMany of our expenses, particularly those relating to properties, capital equipment, and certain manufacturing overhead items, are fixed in the short term. Reduced demand for products causes fixed production costs to be allocated across reduced production volumes, which may adversely affect gross margins and profitability.\nDue to the nature of the work the Company and its subsidiaries perform, the Company may be subject to significant liability claims and disputes.\nThe Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries engage in services that can result in substantial injury or damages that may expose the Company to legal proceedings, investigations and disputes. For example, in the ordinary course of its business, the Company may be involved in legal disputes regarding personal injury and wrongful death claims, employee or labor disputes, professional liability claims, and general commercial disputes, as well as other claims. LSVM as an exempt reporting advisor may also be subject to legal proceedings and investigations with the SEC or other regulatory bodies and may have disputes related to its fiduciary duties to the funds or instruments LSVM manages. An unfavorable legal ruling against the Company or its subsidiaries could result in substantial monetary damages. Although the Company has adopted a range of insurance, risk management, safety, and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities, there can be no assurance that such programs will protect the Company fully from all risks and liabilities. If the Company sustains liabilities that exceed its insurance coverage or for which the Company is not insured, it could have a material adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nOn March 29, 2019, Star Equity and certain of the Healthcare Subsidiaries entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Sterling (the \u201cSNB Loan Agreement\u201d). The SNB Loan Agreement is a five-year revolving credit facility (maturing in March 2024), which, as amended, has a maximum credit amount of $20 million (the \u201cSNB Credit Facility\u201d). On January 31, 2020, Star Equity and certain of its Investments Subsidiaries entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Gerber (as amended, the \u201cStar Loan Agreement\u201d), which provides for a credit facility with borrowing availability of up to $2.5 million and matures on January 1, 2025, unless terminated in accordance with the terms therein (the \u201cStar Loan\u201d). On January 31, 2020, Star Equity and certain of its Construction Subsidiaries entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Gerber (the \u201cEBGL Loan Agreement\u201d), which provides for a credit facility with borrowing availability of up to $3.0 million and matures on January 1, 2022, unless extended or terminated in accordance with the terms therein (the \u201cEBGL Loan\u201d). On January 31, 2020, Glenbrook and EdgeBuilder entered into an Extension and Modification Agreement (the \u201cModification Agreement\u201d) with Premier Bank (\u201cPremier\u201d) that modified the terms of the loan made by Premier to Glenbrook and EdgeBuilder pursuant to that certain Revolving Credit Loan Agreement, dated June 30, 2017, by and among Glenbrook, EdgeBuilder and Premier (as amended, the \u201cPremier Loan Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Modification Agreement, the amount of indebtedness evidenced by the promissory note issued under the Premier Loan Agreement was reduced to $1.0 million. The credit facility under the Loan and Security Agreement, dated February 23, 2016, by and among KBS, ATRM, the Company and Gerber (as amended, the \u201cKBS Loan Agreement\u201d) provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $4.0 million that matures on February 22, 2021, subject to automatic extension for an additional year unless terminated. The SNB Loan Agreement, Star Loan Agreement, EBGL Loan Agreement, the Premier Loan Agreement and the KBS Loan Agreement are individually referred to as the \u201cCompany Loan Agreement\u201d and collectively referred to as the \u201cCompany Loan Agreements.\u201d See Note 16. Related Party Transactions, within the notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding certain ATRM promissory notes that are outstanding.\nOur indebtedness could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences for us and our stockholders. For example, the SNB Loan Agreement requires a balloon payment at the termination of the facility in March 2024, which payments may require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to this future payment if we feel we cannot be successful in our ability to refinance in the future, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and acquisitions, and for other general corporate purposes. In addition, our indebtedness could:\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and competitive pressures in our industry;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.\nThe Company Loan Agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that restrict our operating flexibility and require that we maintain specified financial ratios. If we cannot comply with these covenants, we may be in default under one or more of the Company Loan Agreements.\nThe Company Loan Agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations on our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. The Company Loan Agreements contain affirmative and negative covenants that limit and restrict, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022incur additional debt;\n\u2022sell assets;\n\u2022incur liens or other encumbrances;\n\u2022make certain restricted payments and investments;\n\u2022acquire other businesses; and\n\u2022merge or consolidate.\nThe SNB Loan Agreement limits our ability to pay dividends and to redeem our equity securities if such dividend or redemption would result in our non-compliance with the financial covenants in the SNB Loan Agreement, there is insufficient borrowing availability under the SNB Loan Agreement, or if there is a default or event of default under the SNB Loan Agreement that has occurred and is continuing. In addition, the Company Loan Agreements include explicit restrictions on the payment of dividends and distributions to Star Equity, which could limit the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends. The Company may, therefore be required to reduce or eliminate its dividends, if any, including on the Company Preferred Stock (if any outstanding), and/or may be unable to redeem shares of the Company Preferred Stock (if any outstanding) until compliance with such financial covenants can be met.\nThe Company Loan Agreements contain various financial covenants that, going forward, we or our subsidiaries may not have the ability to meet. The Company Loan Agreements also contain various other affirmative and negative covenants regarding, among other things, the performance of our business, capital allocation decisions made by the Company and its subsidiaries, or events beyond our control.\nOur failure to comply with our covenants and other obligations under the Company Loan Agreements may result in an event of default thereunder. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness (together with accrued interest and fees), or that we will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. This could have serious consequences to our financial condition, operating results, and business, and could cause us to become insolvent or enter bankruptcy proceedings, and stockholders may lose all or a portion of their investment because of the priority of the claims of our creditors on our assets.\nWe may not be entitled to forgiveness of loans we received under the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), and our applicable for such loans could in the future be determined to have been impermissible.\nDuring April and May, we received proceeds of $6.7 million from various loans under the PPP of the CARES Act (the \u201cPPP Loans\u201d). The PPP Loans mature in April and May, 2022 and bear annual interest at a rate of 1.0%.\nIf no forgiveness is granted or if an unsatisfactory SBA audit is completed, then commencing September and October 2021 we will be required to pay the lenders of the PPP Loans equal monthly payments of principal and interest as required to fully amortize by April and May, 2022 any principal amount outstanding on the PPP Loans. Under the CARES Act, loan forgiveness is generally available for the sum of documented payroll costs, covered rent payments, covered mortgage interest and covered utilities during the twenty-four week period beginning on the date the lender makes the first disbursement of the PPP Loan. We will be required to repay any portion of the outstanding principal that is not forgiven, along with accrued interest, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be eligible for loan forgiveness, or a favorable SBA audit. Although, we have applied for forgiveness equally among all business entities, and were forgiven $2.5 million as of December 2020 and an additional $1.2 million in Q1 2021, no assurance is provided that forgiveness for any additional portion of the PPP Loans will ultimately be forgiven by the U.S. Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d).\nThe Company has received full loan forgiveness from the SBA for the DMS Health Note, DMS Imaging Note, KBS Note, EBGL Notes, and Company Note. The Company has sought full forgiveness from the SBA on the DIS Note based on the satisfaction of applicable criteria and guidelines. PPP Loan forgiveness is sought under the belief all entities requesting loan forgiveness have met the stated criteria and guidelines provided by the SBA and terms of the CARES Act; however, no assurance can be provided that forgiveness for any portion of the PPP Loans will be obtained and all PPP loans may remain subject to review by the SBA even after the PPP Loans have been discharged.\nIn April 2020, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury stated that the SBA will perform a full review of any PPP loan over $2.0 million before forgiving the loan. In order to apply for the PPP Loan, we were required to certify, among other things, that the current economic uncertainty made the PPP Loan requests necessary to support our ongoing operations. We made this certification in good faith after analyzing, among other things, the maintenance of our entire workforce, taking into consideration certain limitations associated with the nature of our work in the healthcare business and uncertainty of the industry where healthcare clients resources may be diverted during the COVID-19 pandemic. In considering our position, the Company took into account our need for additional funding to continue operations, and our ability to access alternative forms of capital in the current market environment to offset the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following this analysis, we believe that we satisfied all eligibility criteria for the PPP Loans, and that our receipt of the PPP Loans is consistent with the broad objectives of the PPP of the CARES Act. The certification described above did not contain any objective criteria and is subject to interpretation. If, despite our good-faith belief that given our circumstances we satisfied all eligible requirements for the PPP Loans, we are later determined to have violated any applicable laws or regulations or it is otherwise determined that we were ineligible to receive the PPP Loans, we may be required to repay the PPP Loans in their entirety and/or be subject to additional penalties, which could also result in adverse publicity and damage to reputation. In addition, if these events were to transpire, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSubstantially all of our assets (including the assets of our subsidiaries) have been pledged to lenders as security for our indebtedness under the Company Loan Agreements.\nThe Company Loan Agreements are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and a pledge of all shares and equity interests of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default under any Company Loan Agreement, the applicable lender may, among other things, declare the loans and all other obligations thereunder immediately due and payable and may, in certain instances, increase the interest rate at which loans and obligations bear interest. The exercise by a lender of remedies provided under the applicable Company Loan Agreement in the event of a default thereunder may have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of the applicable borrowers and/or the Company and could cause such borrowers and/or the Company to become bankrupt or insolvent. The obligations of the Company and various subsidiaries of the Company under the Company Loan Agreements are guaranteed by other subsidiaries of the Company and/or the Company. In the event of any bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization, or similar proceeding against us, the assets that are pledged as collateral securing any unpaid amounts under the applicable Company Loan Agreement must first be used to pay such amounts, as well as any other obligation secured by the pledged assets, in full, before making any distributions to our stockholders. In the event of any of the foregoing, our stockholders could lose all or a part of their investment.\nThe inability of the Company or any of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries to comply with applicable financial covenants under the Company Loan Agreements could have a material adverse effect on financial condition of the Company.\nKBS, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and EBGL as of December 31, 2020 were not in compliance with the financial covenants under the KBS Loan Agreement and EBGL loan agreements respectively which required no net annual post-tax loss and certain minimum leverage ratio covenant as of the end of year test dates. We obtained a waiver from Gerber for these events.\nIf the Company or any of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries fail to comply with any applicable financial covenants under the Company Loan Agreements to which they are a party, or if there is otherwise an event of default under the Company Loan Agreements by a borrower, the borrowers\u2019 obligations thereunder may (subject to any applicable cure periods) become immediately due and payable and the applicable lender(s) may demand the repayment of the credit facilities amount outstanding and any unpaid interest thereon.\nIf we are unable to generate or borrow sufficient cash to make payments on our indebtedness, our financial condition would be materially harmed, our business could fail, and stockholders may lose all of their investment.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which will be affected by economic, financial, competitive, business, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to meet our debt obligations or fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity or sell certain of our assets. We cannot assure you that we will be able to restructure or refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, which could cause us to default on our debt obligations and impair our liquidity. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely affect our results from operations and financial condition.\nThe SNB, Premier and Gerber Loan Agreements allow for amounts borrowed thereunder to be subject to a floating interest rate which may change with market interest rates. An increase in prevailing interest rates would have an effect on the interest rates charged on our variable rate debt, which rise and fall upon changes in interest rates. If prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates, the increased interest expense would adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock and our Company Preferred Stock\nIf we fail to pay dividends on our Company Preferred Stock for six or more consecutive quarters, holders of our Company Preferred Stock will be entitled to elect two additional directors to our board of directors.\nTo date no dividends have been paid on the Company Preferred Stock and as a result, cumulative dividends will continue to accrue as part of the liquidation value of the Company Preferred Stock. Whenever dividends on any shares of Company Preferred Stock are in arrears for six or more consecutive quarters, then the holders of those shares together with the holders of all other series of preferred stock equal in rank with the Company Preferred Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, will be entitled to vote separately as a class for the election of a total of two additional directors to Star Equity\u2019s board of directors. Holders of our common stock will not be entitled to vote no such additional directors.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and the value of your investment could decline significantly.\nThe market prices of our common stock and our Company Preferred Stock have been, and we expect them to continue to be, volatile. The prices at which our common stock and Company Preferred Stock trade depend upon a number of factors, including our historical and anticipated operating results, our financial situation, announcements of new products by us or our competitors, history of timely dividend payments, the annual yield from dividends on the Company Preferred Stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments, our ability or inability to raise the additional capital we may need and the terms on which we raise it, and general market and economic conditions. Some of these factors are beyond our control. Broad market fluctuations may lower the market price of our common stock and Company Preferred Stock and affect the volume of trading in our stock, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business, or prospects. It is impossible to assure you that the market price of our shares of common stock and Company Preferred Stock will not fall in the future.\nOur common stock has a low trading volume and shares available under our equity compensation plans could affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur common stock historically has had a low trading volume. Any significant sales of our common stock may cause volatility in our stock price. We also have registered shares of common stock that we may issue under our employee benefit plans or from our treasury stock. Accordingly, these shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to restrictions under the securities laws. If any of these stockholders, or other selling stockholders, cause a large number of securities to be sold in the public market without a corresponding demand, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock. One or more stockholders holding a significant amount of our common stock might be able to significantly influence matters requiring approval by our stockholders, possibly including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions.\nPayment of dividends on our common stock is prohibited unless we have declared and paid (or set apart for payment) full accumulated dividends on the Company Preferred Stock, which also has a significant liquidation value.\nUnless full cumulative dividends on the Company Preferred Stock have been, or contemporaneously are, declared and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for payment for all past dividend periods, no dividends (other than a dividend in shares of common stock or other shares of stock ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation) can be declared and paid or declared and set apart for payment on our common stock, nor can any shares of common stock be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration by the Company. To date no dividends have been paid on the Company Preferred Stock and as a result, cumulative dividends will continue to accrue as part of the liquidation value of the Company Preferred Stock, which had a liquidation value of $10.00 per share at issuance. Dividends on the Company Preferred Stock are payable out of amounts legally available therefor at a rate equal to 10.0% per annum per $10.00 of stated liquidation preference per share, or $1.00 per share of Company Preferred Stock per year. Dividends on the Company Preferred Stock are only be payable in cash. As of December 31, 2019 and 2020, there were 1,915,637 shares of Company Preferred Stock Issued and Outstanding.\nIf Nasdaq delists the Company Preferred Stock from quotation on its exchange, investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in the Company Preferred Stock could be limited.\nIn order to continue listing the Company Preferred Stock on the Nasdaq Global Market, the Company must maintain certain financial, distribution and share price levels. We cannot assure you that the Company Preferred Stock will continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Global Market in the future. If our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market, the Company Preferred Stock would be required to meet the more stringent initial listing standards of the Nasdaq Global Market for a Primary Equity Security. If the Company is unable to meet these standards and the Company Preferred Stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market, the Company may apply to list the Company Preferred Stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. If we are also unable to meet the listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, we may apply to quote the Company Preferred Stock on the OTC Marketplace. If the Company is unable to maintain listing for the Company Preferred Stock, the ability to transfer or sell shares of the Company Preferred Stock will be limited and the market value of the Company Preferred Stock will likely be materially adversely affected.\nThe market for Company Preferred Stock may not provide investors with adequate liquidity.\nThe trading market for the Company Preferred Stock may not provide investors with adequate liquidity. Liquidity of the market for the Company Preferred Stock will depend on a number of factors, including prevailing interest rates, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results, the number of holders of the Company Preferred Stock, the market for similar securities and the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the Company Preferred Stock. The Company cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in the Company will maintain a trading market in the Company Preferred Stock, or how liquid that market will be. If an active market is not maintained, investors may have difficulty selling shares of the Company Preferred Stock.\nThe Company Preferred Stock will bear a risk in connection with redemption.\nThe Company may voluntarily redeem some or all of the Company Preferred Stock on or after September 10, 2024. Any such redemptions may occur at a time that is unfavorable to holders of the Company Preferred Stock. The Company may have an incentive to redeem the Company Preferred Stock voluntarily if market conditions allow the Company to issue other preferred stock or debt securities at a rate that is lower than the rate on the Company Preferred Stock. Also, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the Certificate of Designations, Rights and Preferences of 10% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of the Company (the \u201cCertificate of Designations\u201d)), prior to September 10, 2024, the Company may, at its option, redeem the Company Preferred Stock, in whole or in part.\nStar Equity may not be able to redeem the Company Preferred Stock upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.\nUpon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, unless the Company has exercised its option to redeem the Company Preferred Stock after September 10, 2024, each holder of the Company Preferred Stock will have the right to require the Company to redeem all or any part of such holder\u2019s Company Preferred Stock at a price equal to the liquidation preference of $10.00 per share, plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends up to but excluding the date of payment, but without interest. If the Company experiences a Change of Control Triggering Event, there can be no assurance that the Company would have sufficient financial resources available to satisfy its obligations to redeem the Company Preferred Stock and any indebtedness that may be required to be repaid or repurchased as a result of such event. In addition, Star Equity may be unable to redeem the Company Preferred Stock upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if such redemption would result in our non-compliance with the financial covenants in the Company Loan Agreements. Star Equity\u2019s failure to redeem the Company Preferred Stock could have material adverse consequences for Star Equity and the holders of the Company Preferred Stock.\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are subject to scaled disclosure requirements that may make it more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.\nCurrently, we are a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. As a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d we are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in our filings and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in our filings with the SEC, including being required to provide only two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. Consequently, it may be more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.\nFurthermore, we are a non-accelerated filer as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, and, as such, are not required to provide an auditor attestation of management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting, which is generally required for SEC reporting companies under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Because we are not required to, and have not, had our auditor\u2019s provide an attestation of our management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting, a material weakness in internal controls may remain undetected for a longer period.\nIf we cannot continue to satisfy the Nasdaq Global Market continued listing standards and other Nasdaq rules, our common stock could be delisted, which would harm our business, the trading price of our common stock, our ability to raise additional capital and the liquidity of the market for our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Market. To maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market, we are required to meet certain listing requirements, including, among others, either: (i) a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share, a market value of publicly held shares (excluding shares held by our executive officers, directors and 10% or more stockholders) of at least $5.0 million and stockholders\u2019 equity of at least $10 million; or (ii) a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share, a market value of publicly held shares (excluding shares held by our executive officers, directors and 10% or more stockholders) of at least $15.0 million and total assets of at least $50.0 million and total revenue of at least $50.0 million (in the latest fiscal year or in two of the last three fiscal years).\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with the minimum closing price requirement and other listing requirements. In the event that we fail to maintain compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements for 30 consecutive trading days, our common stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market. If our common stock were to be delisted from Nasdaq and was not eligible for quotation or listing on another market or exchange, trading of our common stock could be conducted only in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board. In such event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate price quotations for, our common stock, and there would likely also be a reduction in our coverage by securities analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, the price and trading volume of our securities could decline.\nThe trading market for our securities will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no or few securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price for our securities would be negatively impacted. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, if any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our clinical trials and operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, the price of our securities would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the price or trading volume of our securities to decline.\nIf we become a personal holding company, our results could be negatively impacted.\nWe could be subject to a second level of U.S. federal income tax on a portion of our income if we are determined to be a personal holding company (\u201cPHC\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. corporation generally will be classified as a PHC for U.S. federal income tax purposes in a given taxable year if (i) at any time during the last half of such taxable year, five or fewer individuals (without regard to their citizenship or residency and including as individuals for this purpose certain entities such as certain tax-exempt organizations, pension funds and charitable trusts) own or are deemed to own (pursuant to certain constructive ownership rules) more than 50% of the stock of the corporation by value (by reference to all common, preferred and all other classes of stock) (the \u201cOwnership Test\u201d) and (ii) at least 60% of the corporation\u2019s adjusted ordinary gross income, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, for such taxable year consists of PHC income (which includes, among other things, dividends, interest, certain royalties, annuities and, under certain circumstances, rents) (the \u201cIncome Test\u201d).\nBased on our knowledge, we believe we meet the Ownership Test discussed above. However, based on our present operations and income sources, we believe that we will not meet the Income Test, and as a result we should not be treated as a PHC for the foreseeable future. If we are or were to become a PHC in a given taxable year, we would be subject to an additional PHC tax, currently 20%, on our undistributed PHC income, which generally includes our taxable income (without the benefit of any federal net operating loss carry forward), subject to certain adjustments. We can give no assurance that we will not become a PHC in the future.\nHolders of the Company Preferred Stock may be unable to use the dividends-received deduction and may not be eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to \u201cqualified dividend income.\u201d\nDistributions paid to corporate U.S. holders of the Company Preferred Stock may be eligible for the dividends-received deduction, and distributions paid to non-corporate U.S. holders of the Company Preferred Stock may be subject to tax at the preferential tax rates applicable to \u201cqualified dividend income,\u201d if the Company has current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Additionally, the Company may not have sufficient current earnings and profits during future fiscal years for the distributions on the Company Preferred Stock to qualify as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the distributions fail to qualify as dividends, U.S. holders would be unable to use the dividends-received deduction and may not be eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to \u201cqualified dividend income.\u201d If any distributions on the Company Preferred Stock with respect to any fiscal year are not eligible for the dividends-received deduction or preferential tax rates applicable to \u201cqualified dividend income\u201d because of insufficient current or accumulated earnings and profits, it is possible that the market value of the Company Preferred Stock might decline.\nA holder of Company Preferred Stock has extremely limited voting rights.\nThe voting rights for a holder of Company Preferred Stock are limited. Our common stock is the only class of securities that carry full voting rights. Voting rights for holders of Company Preferred Stock exist primarily with respect to material and adverse changes in the terms of the Company Preferred Stock and the Company\u2019s failure to pay dividends on the Company Preferred Stock. Other than the limited circumstances described in the Certificate of Designations, and except to the extent required by law, holders of Company Preferred Stock do not have any voting rights.\nThe Company Preferred Stock is not convertible into common stock, including in the event of a change of control of the Company, and investors will not realize a corresponding upside if the price of our common stock increases.\nThe Company Preferred Stock is not convertible into shares of common stock and earns dividends at a fixed rate. Accordingly, an increase in market price of our common stock will not necessarily result in an increase in the market price of the Company Preferred Stock. The market value of the Company Preferred Stock may depend more on dividend and interest rates for other preferred stock, commercial paper and other investment alternatives and the Company\u2019s actual and perceived ability to pay dividends on, to redeem, and, in the event of dissolution, satisfy the liquidation preference with respect to the Company Preferred Stock.\nOur cash available for dividends to holders of the Company Preferred Stock may not be sufficient to pay anticipated dividends, nor can we assure you of our ability to make dividends in the future, and we may need to borrow to make such dividends or may not be able to make such dividends at all.\nTo remain competitive with alternative investments, the Company\u2019s dividend rate may exceed our cash available for dividends, including cash generated from operations. In the event this happens, we intend to fund the difference out of any excess cash on hand or, if permitted, from borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. If we don\u2019t have sufficient cash available for dividends generated by its assets, or if cash available for dividends decreases in future periods, the market price of the Company Preferred Stock could decrease.\nThe protective amendment contained in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which is intended to help preserve the value of certain income tax assets, primarily tax net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d), may have unintended negative effects.\nPursuant to Internal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383, use of our NOLs may be limited by an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. In order to protect the Company\u2019s significant NOLs, we filed an amendment to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (as amended and extended, the \u201cProtective Amendment\u201d) with the Delaware Secretary of State on May 5, 2015. The Protective Amendment was approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders at the Company\u2019s 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 1, 2015.\nOn April 27, 2018, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which was approved by our stockholders at our 2018 Annual Meeting (the \u201cExtended Protective Amendment\u201d). The Extended Protective Amendment effects a three-year extension to the provisions of the Protective Amendment. The Extended Protective Amendment leaves the Protective Amendment unchanged in all respects, other than to extend the expiration date from May 1, 2018 to May 1, 2021, and to make revisions necessary as a result of the enactment of Public Law 115-97 (commonly referred to as the Tax Cut and Jobs Act) on December 22, 2017.\nThe Protective Amendment is designed to assist the Company in protecting the long-term value of its accumulated NOLs by limiting certain transfers of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Protective Amendment\u2019s transfer restrictions generally restrict any direct or indirect transfers of the common stock if the effect would be to increase the direct or indirect ownership of the common stock by any person from less than 4.99% to 4.99% or more of the common stock, or increase the percentage of the common stock owned directly or indirectly by a person owning or deemed to own 4.99% or more of the common stock. Any direct or indirect transfer attempted in violation of the Protective Amendment will be void as of the date of the prohibited transfer as to the purported transferee.\nThe Protective Amendment also requires any person attempting to become a holder of 4.99% or more of our common stock to seek the approval of our Board. This may have an unintended \u201canti-takeover\u201d effect because our Board may be able to prevent any future takeover. Similarly, any limits on the amount of stock that a shareholder may own could have the effect of making it more difficult for shareholders to replace current management. Additionally, because the Protective Amendment may have the effect of restricting a shareholder\u2019s ability to dispose of or acquire our common stock, the liquidity and market value of our common stock might suffer.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may prevent or delay removal of current management or a change in control.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control, discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock, and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock. In addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder unless certain specific requirements are met as set forth in Section 203. These provisions, alone or together, could have the effect of deterring or delaying changes in incumbent management, proxy contests, or changes in control.\nRisks Related to Our Material Weakness and Restatements\nMaterial weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could have a significant adverse effect on our business and the price of our common stock.\nAs a public reporting company, we are subject to the rules and regulations established from time to time by the SEC. These rules and regulations require, among other things, that we have, and periodically evaluate, disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules, regulations and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow decisions regarding required disclosure. Reporting obligations as a public company are likely to continue to burden our financial and management systems, processes and controls, as well as our personnel.\nIn addition, as a public company, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nIn connection with the preparation of our financial statements for 2020, we have identified material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting relating to ineffectively designed controls over review of contracts for new debt agreements and proper application of GAAP for such agreements. Further, we identified and corrected certain errors as described in Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements, included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We deemed these corrections to be material to the consolidated financial statements for quarterly and annual periods after and including March 31, 2019 and any earnings releases or other communications relating to these periods. As a result, management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 were not effective. As described in Part II, Item 9A of this Form 10-K, management is taking steps to remediate the material weakness in our internal controls. There can be no assurance that any measures we take will remediate the material weakness identified, nor can there be any assurance as to how quickly we will be able to remediate the material weakness.", "PERMNO": 90223, "SIC": 8071, "TIC": "DRAD"}
