RISK FACTORS\nOur business involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Such factors could have a significant impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. We believe the most significant of these risks and uncertainties are as follows:\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers.\nWe derive and believe that we will continue to derive in the near term a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers. To the extent that any significant customer uses less of our services or terminates its relationship with us, our revenues could decline significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. After the sale of certain components of our business in 2018 and 2017, our customer concentration increased and revenue from our largest customer comprised 66% and 67% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our three largest customers comprised 80% and 82% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nWe recently sold a profitable business unit. Unless we increase revenues and profits from our remaining business offerings or acquire another line of business, our level of profitability may decrease.\nIn December 2018 we sold the assets of our electrical and cooling equipment and installation business for $2.5 million. This business contributed $1,239,000 towards our 2018 operating income. Unless we are able to increase the revenues and profitability of our existing facilities and systems integration businesses, or acquire another business to replace the profit contribution of the sold business unit, our overall level of profitability will decrease. Although we achieved positive net income in 2017 and 2018, we have a history of recurring annual net losses in prior years, and any failure to maintain or grow our revenue would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn recent prior years (including 2017 and 2016), our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s report contained an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d\nIn its audit reports on our financial statements included in our prior annual reports (including our 2017 and 2016 annual reports), our independent registered public accounting firm noted that we had a history of operating losses and a net capital deficiency. As a result, those audit reports contained an explanatory paragraph that raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur quarterly operating results have shown improved results during 2018 and 2017. During this period, our quarterly revenues have fluctuated between $4.2 and $7.3 million. Our gross profit margin has ranged from 33% to 42%, and our operating results have allowed us to achieve operating profits in each quarter of 2018 and 2017. This level of profitability allowed us to eliminate the deficiency in our stockholder\u2019s equity and to eliminate the working capital deficit during 2018. In December 2018, we entered a 2-year, $1.5 million, receivables-based revolving line of credit facility with Texas Capital Bank, NA to provide us additional liquidity and financial flexibility for managing our working capital and business. Although our overall liquidity position significantly improved during 2018, we have a history of negative working capital, stockholder\u2019s deficit, and net operating losses that may cause uncertainty about our ability to operate our business as a going concern.\nAs the age of modular data centers increases and customers look to shut or replace such units, our level or recurring maintenance revenues could be negatively impacted, and this could adversely affect our operating results.\nModular Data Centers (MDC\u2019s) typically have an expected useful life between 5-8 years unless refreshed with new IT equipment. As they approach the end of their expected life, we would expect customers to terminate the annual maintenance contracts for those MDC\u2019s. This would cause the level of maintenance revenues and our profitability to be negatively impacted unless the units are immediately replaced. Our history suggests that customers will replace MDC\u2019s with new modules that will also be subject to an annual maintenance contract, however the time period between these two events could result in an overall decrease in our level of maintenance revenues.\nWe have substantial amounts of goodwill and other intangibles, and changes in future business conditions could cause these assets to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs that would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have substantial amounts of goodwill and other intangibles resulting from prior acquisitions of businesses. Under generally accepted accounting principles, we do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination that are determined to have indefinite useful lives, but instead review them annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. We are amortizing certain other intangibles over their useful lives. To the extent we determine that such assets have been impaired, we will write-down their carrying value on our consolidated balance sheet and book an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of operations. During each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we conducted such analyses that resulted in no impairment. During 2018 we wrote off $1.1 million of goodwill and $0.1 million of other finite-lived intangible assets that were attributable to the business component that we sold. After these write-offs, the net carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles totaled $0.8 and $1.9 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and the net carrying value of finite lived intangible assets totaled $0.4 million and $0.6 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nWe may be unable to raise additional capital if and when needed.\nOur primary sources of funds to meet our liquidity and capital requirements include cash on hand, funds generated from operations including the funds from our customer financing programs, and borrowings under our bank credit facility. Our business plans and our assumptions around the adequacy of our liquidity are based on estimates regarding estimated revenues and future costs and our ability to secure sources of funding when needed. However, our revenue may not meet our expectations, or our costs may exceed our estimates. Further, our estimates may change, and future events or developments may also affect our estimates. Any of these factors may change our expectation of cash usage during 2019 and beyond or significantly affect our level of liquidity. We may also require additional capital if we seek to acquire additional businesses as a way to increase the scale of our operations. Failure to raise capital when needed, on acceptable terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMost of our contracts may be canceled on short notice, so our revenue and potential profits are not guaranteed.\nMost of our contracts are cancelable on short notice by the customer either at its convenience or upon our default. If one of our customers terminates a contract at its convenience, then we typically are able to recover only costs incurred or committed, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination, which could prevent us from recognizing all of our potential revenue and profit from that contract. If one of our customers terminates the contract due to our default, we could be liable for excess costs incurred by the customer in re-procuring services from another source, as well as other costs. Many of our contracts, including our service agreements, are periodically open to bid. We may not be the successful bidder on our existing contracts that are re-bid. We also provide a portion of our services on a non-recurring, project-by-project basis. We could experience a reduction in our revenue, profitability and liquidity if our customers cancel a significant number of contracts, we fail to win a significant number of our existing contracts upon re-bid or we complete the required work under a significant number of our non-recurring projects and cannot replace them with similar projects. In addition, we provide services under certain master service agreements. If these agreements are terminated, we would be unable to provide on-going services to those customers.\nWe submit change orders to our customers for work we perform beyond the scope of some of our contracts. If our customers do not approve these change orders, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe typically submit change orders under some of our contracts for payment of work performed beyond the initial contractual requirements. The applicable customers may not approve or may contest these change orders and we cannot assure you that these claims will be approved in whole, in part or at all. If these claims are not approved, our net income and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe may not accurately estimate the costs associated with services provided under fixed-price contracts, which could impair our financial performance.\nApproximately 85% of our revenue is derived from fixed price contracts. Under these contracts, we set the price of our services and assume the risk that the costs associated with our performance may be greater than we anticipated. Our profitability is therefore dependent upon our ability to estimate accurately the costs associated with our services. These costs may be affected by a variety of factors, such as lower than anticipated productivity, conditions at the work sites differing materially from what was anticipated at the time we bid on the contract, and higher than expected costs of materials and labor. Certain agreements or projects could have lower margins than anticipated or losses if actual costs for contracts exceed our estimates, which could reduce our profitability and liquidity.\nWe warrant customer equipment against failure in some of our fixed price contracts, and a major equipment failure could have a material impact on our financial performance.\nUnder some of our maintenance contracts we provide limited warranties for the continued performance of equipment, including batteries and actuators used in modular data centers. We estimate the anticipated failure or replacement rate of this equipment, but if a customer location experienced a failure rate of equipment greater than we anticipated, we would incur higher equipment replacement costs and incur a loss on that maintenance contract, and potentially this could have a material negative impact on our profitability and liquidity.\nWe may choose, or be required, to pay our subcontractors even if our customers do not pay or delay paying us for the related services.\nWe use subcontractors to perform many portions of our services and to manage work flow. In some cases, we pay our subcontractors before our customers pay us for the related services. If we choose, or are required, to pay our subcontractors for work performed for customers who fail to pay, or delay paying us for the related work, we could experience a decrease in profitability and liquidity.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, which could reduce our growth opportunities, revenue and operating results.\nThe mission-critical information technology industry in which we operate is highly competitive and continues to become more competitive. We often compete against divisions of large information technology consulting and integration companies, including several that are large domestic companies that may have financial, technical and marketing resources that exceed our own. These larger competitors have an infrastructure and support greater than ours, and accordingly, we continue to experience some price pressure as some companies are willing to take on projects at lower margins. Our competitors may develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior in both price and quality to our services, and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position. Our size often prevents us from bidding on larger, more profitable projects, which significantly reduces our growth opportunities. Although our customers currently outsource a significant portion of these services to us and our competitors, we can offer no assurance that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource specialty contracting services to us in the future.\nThe industries we serve have experienced and may continue to experience rapid technological, structural and competitive changes that could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues.\nThe mission-critical information technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change, intense competition and changing consumer and data center needs. We generate a significant portion of our revenues from customers in the mission-critical information technology industry. New technologies, or upgrades to existing technologies by customers, could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Improvements in existing technology may allow companies to improve their networks without physically upgrading them. Reduced demand for our services or a loss of a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe may be unable to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel and the loss of any of our key executive officers may adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled, knowledgeable, sophisticated and qualified managerial, professional and technical personnel. Our business involves the development of tailored solutions for customers, a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of employees. Accordingly, our employees are one of our most valuable resources. Competition for skilled personnel is intense in our industry. Recruiting and training these personnel require substantial resources. Our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could increase our costs of performing our contractual obligations, reduce our ability to efficiently satisfy our customers\u2019 needs, limit our ability to win new business and constrain our future growth.\nIf we are unable to engage appropriate subcontractors or if our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations, our performance as a prime contractor and ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted.\nOur contract performance may involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform all or a portion of the work we are obligated to deliver to our customers. Our inability to find and engage appropriate subcontractors or a failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily deliver on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies and/or perform the agreed-upon services may materially and adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor.\nIn extreme cases, a subcontractor\u2019s performance deficiency could result in the customer terminating the contract for default with us. A default termination could expose us to liability for excess costs of procurement by the customer and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders.\nSecurity breaches and attacks on our computer systems could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could harm our business, financial results and reputation.\nWe are reliant upon a number of third party and internally-developed software programs to operate our business. We store and transmit our own as well as customer information and data, including individual data of and about their end-user customers. Maintaining the security and availability of our services, network and internal IT systems and the security of information we hold is a critical issue or us and our customers. Any software failure or corruption, including cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, could lead to the dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive, personal or confidential data about us, our employees, customers and end-user customers, could threaten our ability to provide services to our customers, generate negative publicity about us, result in litigation and increased legal liability or costs or lead to government inquiry or oversight. The occurrence of any of these events could harm our business or damage our brand and reputation, lead to loss of customers, higher expenses and possibly imped our present and future success in retaining and attracting new customers.\nA successful assault on our infrastructure would be damaging to our reputation and could adversely affect our financial condition. Similar security risks exist with respect to our business partners and the third-party vendors we rely on for aspects of our information technology infrastructure, support services and administrative functions. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the activities of our business partners and third-party vendors may adversely affect our business even if an attack or breach does not directly impact our systems.\nBecause we do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all future earnings, if any, for use in the operations and expansion of our business. As a result, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on factors our board of directors deems relevant, including, among others, our results of operations, financial condition and cash requirements, business prospects, and the terms of our credit facility and other financing arrangements. Accordingly, realization of a gain on stockholders\u2019 investments will depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders purchased their shares.\nOur insiders beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock. Future sales of common stock by these insiders may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOur officers, directors or their affiliates beneficially own approximately 8.0 million shares of common stock or approximately 38.65% of our outstanding common shares as of March 21, 2019. Stock sales by our directors and officers are subject to compliance with our Code of Conduct and preapproval process from the Chief Financial Officer. Sales of a substantial number of these shares in the public market could decrease the market price of our common stock. In addition, the perception that such sales might occur may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Future issuances or sales of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOur shares are thinly traded and may not be readily marketable.\nOur shares are not widely traded, and daily trading volume is generally very low compared with most publicly traded companies. As a result, you may not be able to readily sell your shares in the company.\nOur common stock may be characterized as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under applicable SEC regulations.\nOur common stock may be characterized as \u201cpenny stock\u201d under SEC regulations. As such, broker-dealers dealing in our common stock may be subject to the disclosure rules for transactions involving penny stocks, which generally require that, prior to a purchase, the broker-dealer determine if purchasing the common stock is suitable for the applicable purchaser. The broker-dealer must also obtain the written consent of the applicable purchasers to purchase the common stock and disclose the best bid and offer prices available for the common stock and the price at which the broker-dealer last purchased or sold the common stock. These additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers may discourage them from effecting transactions in our common stock, which could make it difficult for an investor to sell his, her or its shares at any given time", "PERMNO": 92218, "SIC": 8741, "TIC": "TSSI"}
