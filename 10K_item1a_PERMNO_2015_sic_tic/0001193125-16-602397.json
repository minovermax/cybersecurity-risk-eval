{"cik": "1294924", "company": "InvenSense Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-05-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.\nOur operating results are subject to substantial fluctuations due to a number of factors that could adversely affect our business and our stock price.\nOur net revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and annual basis and are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:\n\u2022\nchanges in end-user demand for the products manufactured and sold by our customers;\n\u2022\nthe receipt, reduction, cancellation or delay of significant orders by customers;\n\u2022\nthe gain or loss of a significant customer;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our products and our customers\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis;\n\u2022\ndelays in our customers\u2019 ability to manufacture and ship products that incorporate our products caused by internal and external factors unrelated to our business and beyond our control;\n\u2022\nshortages of key third party components;\n\u2022\nnew product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nincurrence of research and development and related new product expenditures;\n\u2022\nseasonality or cyclical fluctuations in our markets;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in manufacturing yields;\n\u2022\nsignificant warranty claims, including those not covered by our suppliers;\n\u2022\nwrite-downs of inventory for excess quantity, changes in business priorities, technological obsolescence and erosion in net realizable value;\n\u2022\nchanges in our product mix or customer mix;\n\u2022\nintellectual property disputes involving us, our customers or their suppliers, including court injunctions on sales of our or our customers\u2019 products from intellectual property claims by third party intellectual property rights enforcers;\n\u2022\nloss of key personnel or the availability of skilled workers; and\n\u2022\nthe effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products;\nThe foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. In addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature due to our significant sales, and research and development costs. Any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a net revenue shortfall could magnify its adverse impact on our results of operations.\nThe average selling prices of our products have historically decreased over time and will likely continue to do so, which could have a material adverse effect on our net revenue and gross margins if we cannot reduce our costs or increase volumes to offset.\nWe expect the average selling prices of our products to decrease as a result of several factors. We offer volume pricing discounts to our significant customers. These discounts may offset the revenue expected from\nsuch customers and impact our gross margins. In addition, competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by our competitors, shifts in customers\u2019 product architectures, and product end-of-life programs may cause a reduction in our average selling prices. We have experienced and may continue to experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results due to the erosion of the average selling prices of our products. If we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes, introducing new products with higher gross margins or implementing product manufacturing or internal cost reduction programs, our net revenue and gross margins will decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe currently depend on a limited number of customers and distributors for a material portion of our net revenue. The loss of or a substantial reduction in orders, or default in payments from these customers and distributors would significantly reduce our net revenue, increase our credit risk and adversely impact our operating results.\nHistorically, large purchases by a relatively limited number of customers and distributors have accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue. Our revenue is generated on the basis of purchase orders with our customers and distributors rather than long-term purchase commitments. We expect that sales to these customers and distributors will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue for the foreseeable future. The loss of, or a substantial reduction in orders and default in payments from any of these customers and distributors would have a significant negative impact on our business and our operating results. For fiscal year 2016, Apple accounted for 40% of net revenue and Samsung accounted for 16% of net revenue. For fiscal year 2015, Apple accounted for 30% of net revenue and Samsung accounted for 28% of net revenue. For fiscal year 2014 Samsung accounted for 35% of total net revenue.\nThe termination of a relationship with a major distributor, either by us or by the distributor, could have a negative effect on our revenue. We may not be successful in finding suitable alternative distributors on satisfactory terms, or at all, and this could adversely affect our ability to sell in certain geographical locations or to certain end customers. Additionally, if we terminate a relationship with a major distributor, we may be obligated to repurchase unsold products, which could be difficult or impossible to sell to other end customers. Furthermore, distributors we do business with may face issues obtaining credit, which could impair their ability to make timely payments to us. If any of these events were to occur, it could have a negative impact on our revenue and results of operations.\nWe may not sustain our growth rate, and we may not be able to manage any future growth effectively.\nWe have experienced significant growth in a short period of time. Our net revenue increased from $153.0 million in fiscal 2012 to $418.4 million in fiscal year 2016. We may not achieve similar growth rates in future periods. Our operating results for any prior quarterly or annual period should not be relied on as an indication of our future operating performance. If we are unable to maintain adequate net revenue growth, our financial results could suffer and our stock price could decline.\nTo manage our growth successfully, we believe we must effectively, among other things:\n\u2022\nrecruit, hire, train and manage additional qualified engineers for our research and development activities, especially in the positions of design engineering, product and test engineering and applications engineering, as well as adding additional sales personnel;\n\u2022\nimplement improvements in our financial, administrative, and operational systems, procedures and controls necessary to support larger manufacturing and sales volumes, a greater number of customers and an increased range of products; and\n\u2022\nenhance our information technology support for enterprise resource planning and design engineering by adapting and expanding our systems and tool capabilities, and properly training new hires as to their use.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities or develop new products, and we may fail to satisfy customer requirements, maintain product quality, execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures.\nWe face intense competition and we expect competition to increase in the future, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results, net revenue growth rate and market share.\nThe market for microphone and motion interface products is highly competitive, particularly in the market for consumer electronics, which is highly sensitive to price. In the market for consumer electronics, we compete to various degrees on the basis of our products\u2019 size, price, integration, performance, product roadmap, and reliability. Competition may increase and intensify from semiconductor companies, or the internal resources of large, integrated original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), entering our markets. Increased competition could result in price pressure, reduced profitability and loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur primary competitors in most of our target markets are STMicro and Bosch Sensortec, a division of Robert Bosch GmbH. We also face competition from other integrated and fabless semiconductor manufacturers, from in-house development organizations within some of our potential customers and from smaller companies specializing in MEMS, microphone and motion-sensing products, including those that provide sensor products offering less functionality at a lower cost, such as accelerometers and non-MEMS microphones. We also supply to large, sophisticated platform developers that may prefer to integrate less sophisticated sensors and to develop their own sensor interface application for developers, marginalizing the total solution we offer. Additionally, competitors that have traditionally focused on industrial or automotive applications for MEMS sensors may pursue the consumer electronics market, thus intensifying competition for our products. We expect competition in the markets in which we participate to increase in the future as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings.\nMost of our current competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater resources, greater brand recognition and a larger base of customers than we do. Some of our competitors also have in-house, vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities. In addition, these competitors may have greater credibility with our existing or prospective customers and in some cases are already providing components for products to such existing and prospective customers that may in the future include motion and microphone devices. Moreover, many of our competitors have been doing business with our customers or potential customers for a long period of time and have established relationships that may provide them with information regarding future market trends and requirements that may not be available to us. Additionally, some of our larger competitors may be able to provide greater incentives to customers through rebates and similar programs, particularly to win design opportunities in new product categories. Finally, some of our competitors with multiple product lines may bundle their products to offer customers a broader product portfolio at a more competitive price point. These factors may make it difficult for us to gain or maintain market share.\nRevenue delays and reductions could result from shortages of key third party components to our customers, injunctions prohibiting sales of our customers\u2019 products arising from intellectual property claims or a reduction in orders of our products due to governmental actions taken against or affecting our customers.\nWe are dependent on our customers for our net revenue and our net revenue could be negatively impacted by shortages of key third party components to our customers. In 2012, a third party chip supplier\u2019s supply shortages limited the ability of handset makers to utilize our motion sensing technology.\nIn addition, our revenues could be negatively impacted by court injunctions on sales of our customer products arising from intellectual property claims by their competitors or other intellectual property rights enforcers.\nIn addition, our customers and their suppliers are subject to various laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate, the violation of which could subject them to governmental enforcement actions that could limit their ability to import necessary components or restrict their ability to sell and distribute their own products. If such actions are taken against our customers, this could cause them to reduce their orders for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the U.S. government may limit our ability to export our products to certain customers pursuant to the Export Administration Regulations, which could have a negative impact on our revenues. In 2016, a telecommunications equipment manufacturer was added to the Entity List by the U.S. Department of Commerce, thereby prohibiting U.S. companies from exporting their products to this company. The imposition of such a sanction on one of our significant customers could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to order and shipment uncertainties, and differences between our estimates of customer demand and actual results could negatively affect our inventory levels, sales and operating results.\nChanges in the customer demand for our products may affect our revenue, cost of goods sold, gross margin percentage and inventory level. Our products are manufactured by third-party manufacturers according to our estimates of customer demand, which requires us to make separate demand forecast assumptions for every customer, each of which may introduce significant variability into our aggregate estimates. In addition, substantially all of our sales to date, including sales to Apple and Samsung, have been made on a purchase order basis. We do not have any long-term commitments with any of our customers. As a result, our customers may cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty which could negatively impact our business and results of operations. Our limited visibility into future customer demand and the product mix could lead to inadequate or excess purchase of raw material, obsolete inventory which could adversely affect our net revenue, gross margin and operating results. Moreover, because products with motion interface platforms have only recently been introduced into many of our target markets, many of our customers could have difficulty accurately forecasting demand for their products and the timing of their new product introductions, which ultimately affects their demand for our products. This in turn could cause our revenue to decline and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe generally place orders for products with some of our suppliers approximately three to four months prior to the anticipated delivery date, with order volumes based on our forecasts of demand from our customers. Accordingly, if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products, we may be unable to obtain adequate and cost-effective foundry or assembly capacity from our third-party manufacturers to meet our customers\u2019 delivery requirements, or we may accumulate excess inventories. On occasion, we have been unable to adequately respond to unexpected increases in customer purchase orders and therefore were unable to benefit from this incremental demand. In addition, our third-party manufacturers may prioritize orders placed by other companies that order higher volumes of products or otherwise qualify for more favorable treatment, many of whom are larger and more established than us. In the event that manufacturing capacity is reduced or eliminated at one or more of our third-party manufacturers\u2019 facilities, we could have difficulties fulfilling our customer orders, and our net revenue and results of operations could decline.\nHistorically, because of this limited visibility, at times our actual results have been different from our forecasts of customer demand. Some of these differences have been material, leading to net revenue and margin forecasts different from the results we were actually able to achieve. These differences may occur in the future. Conversely, if we were to underestimate customer demand or if sufficient manufacturing capacity were unavailable, we could be unable to take advantage of net revenue opportunities, potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships and market reputation, and be subject to contractual penalties for not meeting customer demand. In addition, any significant future cancellations or deferrals of product orders could materially and adversely impact our profit margins, increase our inventory write-downs due to product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations.\nIf we have significant inventories that become obsolete or cannot be sold at acceptable prices, our results may be negatively impacted.\nAs our business has grown, our inventory levels have risen and include items for which we may not have customer purchase orders when manufactured, requiring us to actively market and sell those products. If significant inventories of our products become obsolete, or are otherwise not able to be sold at favorable prices or without significant distraction from our other business priorities, our operating results could be materially affected.\nIf we are unable to implement our business strategy, our revenues and profitability may be adversely affected.\nOur future financial performance and success are largely dependent on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully. Our present business strategy which is to develop and offer products that are easy to integrate, meet or exceed the customer-required performance and cost requirements, and that set industry performance benchmarks, includes plans to introduce new products and services and establish new sales channels as well as to manage, maintain and refine our product portfolio in the mobile, wearables, smart home, gaming, industrial, drone, automotive and IoT (internet of things) product opportunity spaces. We cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy or that implementing our strategy will sustain or improve our results of operations. In particular, we cannot assure you that we will be able to build our position in markets with high growth potential, increase our volume or net revenue, rationalize our manufacturing operations or reduce our costs and expenses.\nOur business strategy is based on our assumptions about the future demand for our current products, and the new products, services and applications that we are developing, and on our ability to produce our products profitably. Each of these factors depends on our ability, among other factors, to finance our operating and product development activities, maintain high quality and efficient operations, contract for manufacturing services in a cost-effective and timely manner and successfully diversify our business or introduce new products and services that will maintain or increase our revenues. In addition, circumstances beyond our control and changes in our business or industry may require us to change our business strategy.\nOur primary customers, our sales and support facilities, our testing facilities and our third-party manufacturers are located in regions that are subject to natural disasters.\nCurrently, our wafer sort, final test and shipping operations, as well as the facilities of our third-party wafer manufacturing and assembly suppliers, are located in Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the Philippines. Our largest customers are based in the United States, Korea, China and Japan. We have sales and support centers in China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, United Arab Emirates and Taiwan. In addition, our headquarters are located in Northern California. Taiwan, the Republic of Korea and Japan are susceptible to earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons, floods and other natural disasters, and have experienced severe earthquakes, typhoons and floods in recent years that caused significant property damage and loss of life. The Northern California area is also subject to significant risk of earthquakes.\nIn addition, facilities located in the Republic of Korea, Taiwan and China are subject to other risks, including the outbreak of contagious diseases, such as the H1N1 virus, and natural disasters, such as earthquakes in Taiwan. Although these risks have not materially adversely affected our business, financial condition or results of operations to date, there can be no assurance that such risks will not do so in the future. There also can be no assurance that another earthquake, tsunami or other natural disaster will not occur in the Pacific Rim region, where the risk of such an event is significant due to, among other things, the proximity of major earthquake fault lines in the area. Any such future event could include power outages, fires, flooding or other adverse conditions, as well as disruption or impairment of production capacity and the operations of our manufacturers and customers, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in shipments of our products until we are able to shift our manufacturing, assembly or testing from the affected facilities or contract to another location or third-party vendor. Under such\ncircumstances, there can be no assurance that alternative capacity could be obtained on favorable terms, if at all. Any catastrophic loss to any of our facilities would likely disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and net revenue and result in significant expenses to repair or replace the facility. In particular, any catastrophic loss at the San Jose, California or Taiwan facilities would materially and adversely affect our business.\nTo date, a significant amount of our net revenue has been attributable to demand for our products used in handheld devices, including smartphones, tablet devices and video gaming and the failure of this market to grow could have a negative impact on our business and results of operation.\nWe derive a significant amount of our net revenue from our products used in handheld devices, including smartphones and tablet devices, and historically we have derived significant revenue from video gaming. Future generations of these products may not adopt motion interface at all or, if they do, may use our competitors\u2019 products, internally developed solutions or alternative technologies not based on MEMS sensors. If we are not successful in obtaining design wins in new generations of these products or, if these products that incorporate our products are not successful, our net revenue and operating results will decline. Even if we achieve design wins, the markets for specific products incorporating our solutions may not continue to grow or may decline for a number of reasons outside of our control, including competition among companies and market saturation.\nAdditionally, these markets are subject to volatility from changes in the macroeconomic environment as well as industry specific trends, such as trends resulting from feature, product, acquisition or other announcements by one of the major companies in these markets. Any decline or volatility in these overall markets could cause our net revenue and operating results to fall short of expectations or decline.\nWhile the general market for handheld devices is very fragmented, a limited number of manufacturers command a relatively large share of the market for smartphones with enhanced functionality. All of these customers are large, multinational companies with substantial negotiating power relative to us over price and terms of supply. Securing design wins with any of these companies or other smartphone manufacturers requires a substantial investment of our time and resources. Some of these companies produce products that already include motion sensors and microphones, and they may decide not to adopt our sensor devices. Additionally, the smartphone market is subject to a unique set of industry dynamics, such as shorter design cycles and multiple devices and manufacturers. The smartphone market and the market for related peripheral products is highly competitive, and if we are unable to continue to successfully navigate these dynamics, if we are unable to adapt our products in response to any future changes in the requirements of the operating systems or if the products of manufacturers that choose to incorporate our solutions are not commercially successful, our net revenue may decrease and our operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent upon the continued market acceptance and adoption of motion interface and, in particular, the adoption of our MotionTracking devices in consumer electronics products, the failure of which could have an adverse effect on our business and our operating results.\nMarket adoption and acceptance of motion interface technology, including our MotionTracking devices, in consumer electronics products is dependent on a number of factors that are outside of our control. For example, device manufacturers must decide whether incorporating the improved functionality and performance that comes with motion interface will result in improved sales and acceptance of their products. In addition, device manufacturers may not be able to integrate motion interface or processing technologies into their products in a manner that they, or their customers, consider to deliver cost-effective, compelling functionality, and developers may not introduce applications that employ motion interface in a compelling way. In addition, there are a number of companies that claim intellectual property ownership over motion as a user interface, and these claims could discourage manufacturers from integrating motion interface technology into their products.\nWe are dependent upon the continued adoption of motion interface technology, including our MotionTracking devices, in mobile handheld devices, including smartphones and tablet devices. While smartphone manufacturers\nare incorporating advanced motion sensing functionality, including three-axis gyroscopes, into their devices, if applications that utilize this functionality are not further developed or if consumers do not find the applications provided by motion interface technology compelling, mobile device manufacturers may curtail their adoption of this technology. Consequently, our net revenue may fall short of our expectations and our operating results could be adversely affected. Any unanticipated delay in the launch or decline in the volume of our customers\u2019 smartphone and tablet device platforms into which we have been designed may negatively impact our operating results.\nFailure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our operating results.\nManufacturing yields for our products may be negatively impacted by increasing product design complexity, increased integration, higher performance levels demanded by our customers and usage of MEMS process technology. We do not know whether a yield problem exists until our products are manufactured in high volume based on our design. As a result, yield deficiencies may not be identified until well into the production process. Because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity, decreases in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our costs which would negatively impact our gross margin, cause us to fail to meet product delivery commitments and force us to allocate our available product supply among end customers. Lower than expected yields could harm our operating results, our customer relationships and our reputation.\nWe rely on a limited number of third parties to supply, manufacture and assemble our products, and the failure to manage our relationships with these third-party contractors could adversely affect our ability to produce, market and sell our products.\nWe do not have our own manufacturing facilities. We operate based on an outsourced manufacturing business model that utilizes third-party foundry and packaging capabilities. Relying on third-party manufacturing, assembly and packaging presents significant risks to us, including the following:\n\u2022\nreduced control over delivery schedules, yields and product reliability;\n\u2022\nprice increases;\n\u2022\nthe unavailability of, or potential delays in obtaining access to, key process technologies;\n\u2022\nthe inability to achieve required production or test capacity and acceptable yields on a timely basis;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in establishing additional manufacturing suppliers if we are presented with the need to transfer our manufacturing process technologies to them;\n\u2022\nshortages of materials;\n\u2022\nfailures to allocate sufficient capacity for us to have our products produced and shipped to our customers on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nmisappropriation of our intellectual property; and\n\u2022\nlimited warranties on wafers or products supplied to us.\nWe make substantially all of our purchases through purchase orders based on our own rolling forecasts, and our third-party manufacturers are not required to supply us products beyond these forecasted quantities. Beyond minimal capacity guarantees, most of our third-party manufacturers do not have any obligations to provide us with additional capacity on a timely basis.\nThe performance of our third-party manufacturers is outside of our control. At present, we depend primarily upon TSMC and Global Foundries to manufacture most of our products. Although we are not obligated to purchase a specific volume of products from, or to contract with these manufacturers on an exclusive basis, we anticipate that we will be dependent on these manufacturers to supply a substantial portion of our products for the next several fiscal quarters. We expect that it would take approximately nine to 16 months to transition our\nmanufacturing to new third-party manufacturers. Such a transition would likely require certain customers to qualify our new manufacturers. If one or more of our third-party contractors or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market, the reliability of our products and our reputation could suffer.\nIn the future, if our third-party manufacturers fail to deliver quality products and components on time and at reasonable prices, we could have difficulties fulfilling our customer orders, our net revenue could decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. In addition, if our foundry partners materially increase their prices for the fabrication of our products, our business would be materially harmed.\nWe rely on our ecosystem partners to enhance our product offerings and our inability to continue to develop or maintain these relationships in the future would harm our ability to remain competitive.\nOur strategy is to work closely with third parties, which we refer to as ecosystem partners, including developers of operating systems such as Android, developers of motion sensing applications, engineering services companies, and manufacturers of semiconductors with complementary functionality such as micro-controllers, application processors, and other sensors. We work with these ecosystem partners in order to add features and improve time-to-market for customers, thereby taking advantage of our unique capabilities and encouraging potential customers to adopt our solutions. Continued growth in adoption of motion tracking solutions depends in part on activities of these ecosystem partners supporting the development of systems and applications that can fully utilize the capabilities of our products. If we are not able to maintain and develop our relationships with these third parties, our ability to compete could be harmed.\nOur product development efforts are time consuming and expensive and may not generate an acceptable return, if any.\nOur product development efforts require us to incur substantial research and development expense. Our research and development expense was $97.4 million for fiscal year 2016 and $90.6 million for fiscal year 2015, and we anticipate that research and development expense will increase in the future as we expand our product offerings and diversify our business. We may not be able to achieve an acceptable return, if any, on our research and development efforts.\nThe development of our products is highly complex. We have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and product enhancements, and we could experience delays in the future. Unanticipated problems in developing products could also divert substantial engineering resources, which may impair our ability to develop new products and enhancements and could substantially increase our costs. Furthermore, we may expend significant amounts on research and development programs that may not ultimately result in commercially successful products. As a result of these and other factors, we may be unable to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a cost-effective and timely manner, and any new products we develop and offer may never achieve market acceptance. Any failure to successfully develop future products would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to develop and introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis, our ability to attract and retain customers could be impaired, and our competitive position could be harmed.\nWe operate in a dynamic environment characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards, and rapid technological obsolescence. To compete successfully, we must design, develop, market and sell new or enhanced products that provide increasingly higher levels of performance, integration and reliability and meet the cost expectations of our customers. A key element of our product strategy is to integrate additional sensors, sensor-based functions and sensor interface functionality into our products, and to reduce the size and power consumption of products providing a given level of functionality. The majority of our production volume\ntoday derives from our integrated three-axis and six-axis product families. We have introduced, and intend to continue to introduce, more highly integrated products that include greater motion sensing functionality, microphone and other audio functionality and further enhancements to on-board sensor interface capabilities. We may not be successful in achieving market acceptance of our more highly integrated single-chip products on the financial or other terms that we expect to obtain, and existing or potential new customers may instead rely on multi-chip, discrete sensor solutions. This could result in the loss of net revenue and earnings and potential inventory write-downs or obsolescence. In addition, the introduction of new products by our competitors, the market acceptance of products based on new or alternative technologies, or the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing or future products obsolete.\nOur failure to anticipate or timely develop new or enhanced products or technologies in response to technological change could result in decreased net revenue and our competitors achieving more design wins. In particular, we may experience difficulties with product design, manufacturing or marketing that could delay or prevent our development, introduction or marketing of new or enhanced products, including products with higher levels of sensor integration such as our seven-axis device. If we fail to introduce new or enhanced products with potentially greater integration that meet the needs of our customers, or penetrate new markets, in a timely fashion, we will lose market share and our operating results will be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we have expanded our product portfolio to include software, fingerprint and automotive technology offerings. In fiscal year 2016, we announced several long term business opportunities: UltraPrint, our ultrasonic fingerprint authentication solution, Coursa, a cloud-based motion data platform and a strategic alliance with a sensor and system integration partner for automotive applications. We have not yet realized revenue from either of these initiatives and may not do so in the future. We have limited experience in designing and selling SaaS and fingerprint technology products. The markets for these products are intensely competitive and we may not achieve market acceptance or design wins in substantial numbers. In addition, we may encounter unforeseen difficulties, complications and other unknown factors that may delay deployment of our new products. If we are unable to realize revenue from our new software and fingerprint technology products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenue.\nThe complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses caused by defects or bugs, which could delay the introduction or acceptance of our new products, damage our reputation with current or prospective customers, lead to warranty and product liability claims and product recalls and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur products are highly complex and may contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are released. In addition, it is important that they work well with a range of operating systems, networks, devices and standards that we do not control. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, defects, bugs and interoperability issues. There may be additional defects and bugs contained in our products that may not have manifested. If any of our products contains defects or bugs, or have reliability, quality, interoperability or other problems, we may not be able to successfully correct such problems in a timely manner. Consequently, our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers. In addition, these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales to our customers. Defects or bugs could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve design wins from existing customers and to attract new customers, which could adversely affect our market share and operating results. In addition, defects or bugs could interrupt or delay shipments to existing customers. If a significant defect or bug is not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product, we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall, repair or replacement costs. As a result, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nAny defects in our products may also result in product liability claims against us by our customers or others and from time to time, and may require us to make significant expenditures to defend against these claims or pay damage awards. In the event of a warranty claim, we may also incur costs if we compensate the affected\ncustomer. For example, under the terms of our contracts with our larger customers, we are obligated to replace, repair or refund payment for defective products discovered by the customer generally for a period of up to three years after such products are delivered, and we remain responsible and liable for any latent defects caused by reasons attributable to us even after the contractual warranty period has elapsed. We maintain product liability insurance, but this insurance is limited in amount and subject to significant deductibles. There is no guarantee that our insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. We also may incur costs and expenses if defects in a device we supply make it necessary to recall a customer\u2019s product. The process of identifying a recalled device in products that have been widely distributed may be lengthy and require significant resources, and we may incur significant replacement costs, contract damage claims from our customers and reputational harm. Costs or payments made in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to seasonality, which causes our net revenue to fluctuate.\nIn addition to the general cyclicality of the semiconductor and consumer electronics industries, our business is subject to seasonality because of the nature of our target markets. At present, virtually all of our motion interface products are sold in the consumer electronics market. Sales of consumer electronics tend to be weighted towards holiday periods, and many consumer electronics manufacturers typically experience seasonality in sales of their products. Seasonality affects the timing and volume of orders for our products as our customers tend to increase production of their products that incorporate our solutions in the first three quarters of our fiscal year in order to build inventories for the holiday season. Sales of our products tend to correspondingly increase during these quarters and to significantly decrease in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. For example, our net revenue was $120 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 and declined to $80 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. We expect this seasonality to continue in future periods and, as a result, our operating results are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nOur future success depends on the continuing efforts of our key personnel, and on our ability to successfully attract, train and retain additional key personnel.\nOur future success depends heavily upon the continuing services of the members of our senior management team and various engineering and other technical personnel. If one or more of our senior executives or other key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them easily or at all, our business may be disrupted, and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if any member of our senior management team or any of our other key personnel joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may experience material disruption of our operations and development plans and lose customers, distributors, know-how and key professionals and staff members, and we may incur increased operating expenses as the attention of other senior executives is diverted to recruit replacements for key personnel. Our industry is characterized by high demand and intense competition for talent, and the pool of qualified candidates is very limited. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain existing, or attract and retain new, qualified personnel, including senior executives and skilled engineers, whom we will need to achieve our strategic objectives. In addition, our ability to train and integrate new employees into our operations may not meet the growing demands of our business. The loss of any of our key personnel or our inability to attract or retain qualified personnel, including engineers and others, could delay the development and introduction of, and would have an adverse effect on our ability to sell, our products, which could harm our overall business and growth prospects.\nOur intellectual property is integral to our business and if we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is advantageous and\ncost-justified. Our ability to use and prevent others from using our patented fabrication platform, which is the subject of several patents and patent applications, is crucial to our success. Effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in some countries. Some of our products and technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application. We cannot guarantee that:\n\u2022\nany of our present or future patents or patent claims will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or abandoned;\n\u2022\nour intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us;\n\u2022\nour ability to assert our intellectual property rights against potential competitors or to settle current or future disputes will not be limited by our agreements with third parties;\n\u2022\nany of our pending or future patent applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought;\n\u2022\nour intellectual property rights will be enforced in jurisdictions where legal protection may be weak or legal rights difficult to obtain or enforce for a company headquartered outside that jurisdiction;\n\u2022\nthird parties will not infringe our key intellectual property, and specifically, our patented fabrication platform;\n\u2022\nany of the trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights that we presently employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or abandoned; or\n\u2022\nwe will not lose the ability to assert our intellectual property rights against others.\nIn addition, our competitors or others, such as our fabrication process vendors, may design around our patents or technologies, such as by creating a fabrication process that is distinct from ours. Effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or more limited in one or more relevant jurisdictions relative to the protections available in the United States, or may not be applied for in one or more relevant jurisdictions. If we pursue litigation to assert our intellectual property rights, an adverse judicial decision in any of these legal actions could limit our ability to assert our intellectual property rights, limit our ability to obtain new product inventory, limit the value of our technology or otherwise negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMonitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property may have occurred or may occur in the future. Although we have taken steps to try to minimize the risk of this occurring, any such failure to identify unauthorized use and otherwise adequately protect our intellectual property would adversely affect our business.\nWe also rely on customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, distributors, employees and consultants, and we implement security measures to protect our trade secrets. We cannot ensure that these contractual protections and security measures will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our suppliers, employees or consultants will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of such contracts.\nWe face claims of intellectual property infringement from time to time and may face additional such claims in the future, which could be time-consuming and costly to defend or settle and, if adversely adjudicated, could result in the loss of significant rights.\nThe semiconductor and MEMS industries are characterized by companies that hold large numbers of patents and other intellectual property rights and that vigorously pursue, protect and enforce intellectual property rights. STMicro, one of our competitors, previously filed two lawsuits and an action before the United States International Trade Commission asserting that several of our products infringe its patents, although those lawsuits have been settled and the companies entered into a multi-year, worldwide patent cross license agreement. A non-practicing entity asserted in litigation that one of our gyroscope products infringes a patent held by it. This matter was\nresolved. Robert Bosch GmbH, another one of our competitors, previously made generalized assertions of potential patent infringement. We have resolved all assertions of potential infringement between the companies and entered into a multi-year, worldwide patent cross license agreement. In the future other third parties may assert against us and our customers and distributors, their patent and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business.\nClaims that our products, processes or technology, including products, processes or technology provided by our manufacturers or suppliers about which we have no or limited knowledge, infringe third-party intellectual property rights, regardless of their merit or resolution, have been, and may continue in the future to be, costly to defend or settle and could divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. In addition, many of our customer and distributor agreements, including our agreement with our largest customer, require us to indemnify and defend our customers or distributors, as applicable, from third-party infringement claims and pay damages in the case of adverse rulings. Claims of this sort also could harm our relationships with our customers or distributors and might deter future customers from doing business with us. Indemnification from our manufacturers and suppliers may not be required or adequate to cover our damages and litigation costs. We do not know whether we will prevail in current assertions of potential infringement or in any future proceedings we may be involved in given the complex technical issues involved and the inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If any such assertions or proceedings result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to:\n\u2022\ncease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products, processes or technology;\n\u2022\npay substantial damages for infringement;\n\u2022\nexpend significant resources to develop non-infringing products, processes or technology;\n\u2022\nlicense technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\ncross-license our technology to a competitor to resolve an infringement claim, which could weaken our ability to compete with that competitor; or\n\u2022\npay substantial damages to our customers or end users to discontinue their use of or to replace infringing technology sold to them with non-infringing technology.\nAny of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology systems, and failure of these systems to function properly or unauthorized access to our systems could result in business disruption.\nWe rely on information technology, or IT systems to manage our operations. We regularly evaluate these systems to make enhancements. We periodically implement new, or upgrade existing operational and IT systems. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to systems could adversely affect our ability to record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis.\nThese information technology systems are subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters, viruses, destructive or inadequate code, malware, power failures, cyber attacks, phishing and other events. We have experienced, and we may in the future experience, breaches or unauthorized access of our IT systems. To the extent that these information systems are under our control, we have implemented security procedures, such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes, to address the outlined risks. We may incur significant costs in order to implement, maintain and/or update security systems that may be necessary to protect our information systems. A material breach in the security of our information systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets, negatively impact our operations, or result in the compromise of personal and confidential information of our employees, customers or\nsuppliers. To the extent that any system failure, accident or security breach results in disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to our data or confidential information, our reputation, business, results of operations and/or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a miscalculation of the level of investment needed to ensure our technology solutions are current and up-to-date as technology advances and evolves could result in disruptions in our business should the software, hardware or maintenance of such items become out-of-date or obsolete. Furthermore, when we implement new systems and/or upgrade existing systems, there is a risk that our business may be temporarily disrupted during the period of implementation.\nIf we do not achieve continued tax benefits as a result of our corporate restructuring completed in fiscal year 2011, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe completed a restructuring of our corporate organization during fiscal year 2011 to more closely align our corporate structure with the international nature of our business activities. This corporate restructuring activity has allowed us to reduce our overall effective tax rate through changes in how we develop and use our intellectual property and the structure of our international procurement and sales operations, including by entering into arrangements that establish transfer prices for our intercompany transactions. There can be no assurance that the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate or to which we are otherwise deemed to have sufficient tax nexus will not challenge the tax benefits that we expect to realize as a result of the restructuring. In addition, future changes to U.S. or non-U.S. tax laws, including proposed legislation to reform U.S. taxation of international business activities as described above, could negatively impact the anticipated tax benefits of the proposed restructuring. Any benefits to our tax rate will also depend on our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with the restructuring of our corporate organization and applicable taxing provisions, including by eliminating the amount of cash distributed to our U.S. parent by our subsidiaries. If the intended tax treatment is not accepted by the applicable taxing authorities, or changes in tax law(s) negatively impact the proposed structure or we do not operate our business consistent with the restructuring and applicable tax provisions, we may fail to achieve the financial efficiencies that we anticipate as a result of the restructuring and our future operating results and financial condition may be negatively impacted.\nBecause we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, any changes in our geographical earnings mix, including those resulting from our intercompany transfer pricing arrangements or from changes in the rules governing transfer pricing, could materially impact our effective tax rate. For example, a recent U.S. Tax Court ruling may change the way stock-based compensation costs are treated in cost sharing arrangements with subsidiaries which, if upheld, could affect our effective tax rate and cash flow. In addition, we maintain significant deferred tax assets related to federal research credits and other tax attributes. Our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future taxable income in the relevant jurisdiction, particularly the United States. Changes in our forecasts of future income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings that could materially affect our financial results.\nThe enactment of legislation implementing changes in U.S. taxation of international business activities and/or the adoption of other tax reform policies and related government and regulations in the countries in which we operate could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nTax bills are introduced from time to time to reform U.S. taxation of international business activities. Depending on the final form of legislation enacted, if any, the consequences may be significant for us due to the large scale of our international business activities. If any of these proposals are enacted into legislation, they could have material adverse consequences on the amount of tax we pay and thereby on our financial position and results of operations.\nFurther, recent developments on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) project on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. We are currently undergoing income tax audits in the U.S. and several foreign tax jurisdictions, The U.S. and foreign tax authorities have questioned our intercompany transfer pricing arrangements during these audits. In recent years, several other U.S. companies have had their transfer pricing arrangements challenged as part of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examinations, which have resulted in material proposed assessments and/or litigation with respect to those companies. If the ultimate determination of income taxes or at-source withholding taxes assessed under the current IRS audits or audits being conducted in any other tax jurisdiction results in an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition would be adversely affected. Our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by different and evolving interpretations of existing law or regulations, which in turn would negatively impact our operating and financial results as a whole.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur sales contracts are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and therefore substantially all of our net revenue is not subject to short-term foreign currency risk. Some of our operating expenses are incurred outside the United States, are denominated in foreign currency and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the New Taiwan Dollar. We do not currently hedge currency exposures relating to operating expenses incurred outside of the United States, but we may do so in the future. If we do not hedge against these risks, or if our attempts to hedge against these risks are not successful, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We also may be indirectly affected by movements in exchange rates. For example, the recent strength of the US dollar against the Euro may result in our European-based competitors obtaining a cost advantage over us in negotiations with customers.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations.\nSales to end customers in Asia countries accounted for 54% of our net revenue in fiscal year 2016 and 63% of our net revenue in fiscal year 2015. In addition, approximately 40% of our employees are located in Asia, and substantially all of our products are manufactured, assembled or tested in Asia. Multiple factors relating to our international operations and to the particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These factors include:\n\u2022\nchanges in political, regulatory, legal or economic conditions;\n\u2022\nrestrictive governmental actions, such as restrictions on the transfer or repatriation of funds and foreign investments and trade protection measures, including export duties, quotas, customs duties and tariffs;\n\u2022\ndisruptions of capital and trading markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays;\n\u2022\ncivil disturbances or political instability;\n\u2022\ngeopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war or political or military coups;\n\u2022\npublic health emergencies;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations relating to our international operating activities;\n\u2022\ndiffering employment practices and labor standards;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property;\n\u2022\nlocal business and cultural factors that differ from our customary standards and practices;\n\u2022\nnationalization and expropriation;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in obtaining distribution and support services.\nSubstantially all of our products and our end customers\u2019 products are manufactured in Taiwan and China. Any conflict or uncertainty in these countries, including due to public health or safety concerns, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse global economic conditions could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and liquidity.\nAdverse global economic conditions have from time to time caused or exacerbated significant slowdowns in the semiconductor industry generally, as well as in our target markets, which have adversely affected our business and results of operations. In recent periods, investor and customer concerns about the global economic outlook, including concerns about the level of growth in China, economic recovery in the United States and conflict in Eastern Europe have adversely affected market and business conditions in general. Macroeconomic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue, gross margin and expenses. Sustained uncertainty about, or worsening of, current global economic conditions may cause our customers and consumers to reduce or delay spending (leading to reduced demand for our products), could lead to the insolvency of key suppliers (resulting in product delays) and customers, and could intensify pricing pressures. Any or all of these factors could negatively affect our business, financial condition and result of operations.\nIndustry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results.\nThere has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years. We expect this trend to continue. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. We believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor and consumer electronics industries.\nThe semiconductor and consumer electronics industries are highly cyclical and are characterized by constant and rapid technological change, rapid product obsolescence and price erosion, evolving standards, short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. These industries experienced a significant downturn as part of the broader global recession in 2008 and 2009. Industry downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. The most recent downturn and any future downturns could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Furthermore, any upturn in the semiconductor or consumer electronics industries could result in increased competition for access to the third-party foundry and assembly capacity on which we are dependent to manufacture and assemble our products. None of our third-party foundry or assembly contractors has provided assurances that adequate capacity will be available to us in the future.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements could be impaired, which could adversely affect our operating results, our ability to operate our business and investors\u2019 views of us.\nMaintaining adequate internal controls and procedures over financial reporting to help ensure that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. We have established processes, controls and procedures that are designed to allow our management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, our internal control over financial reporting under the rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404.\nImplementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training of our directors, officers and employees, entail substantial costs in order to modify our existing accounting systems, and take a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business. Furthermore, as we grow our business or acquire other businesses, our internal controls may become more complex and we may require significantly more resources to ensure they remain effective. Failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, either in our existing business or in businesses that we may acquire, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations to identify material weaknesses in our internal controls; the disclosure of such failure, even if quickly remedied, may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and the trading price of our ordinary shares may decline. Remediation of a material weakness could require us to incur significant expense and if we fail to remedy any material weakness, our financial statements may be inaccurate, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital markets may be restricted, the trading price of our ordinary shares may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, including the SEC or The New York Stock Exchange. We may also be required to restate our financial statements from prior periods. As a result, investors\u2019 perceptions that our internal controls are inadequate or that we are unable to produce accurate financial statements may adversely affect our stock price.\nOur business is subject to various governmental regulations, and compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses. If we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, which could subject us to civil or criminal penalties.\nThe complex legal and regulatory environment exposes us to compliance and litigation costs and risks that could materially affect our operations and financial results. These laws and regulations may change, sometimes significantly, as a result of political or economic events. They include tax laws and regulations, import and export laws and regulations, government contracting laws and regulations, labor and employment laws and regulations, securities and exchange laws and regulations (and other laws applicable to publicly-traded companies such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), and environmental laws and regulations. In addition, proposed laws and regulations in these and other areas, such as healthcare, could affect the cost of our business operations. Our international operations face political, legal, operational, exchange rate and other risks that we do not face in our domestic operations. We face the risk of discriminatory regulation, nationalization or expropriation of assets, changes in both domestic and foreign laws regarding trade and investment abroad, potential loss of proprietary information due to piracy, misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights. Violations of any of these laws and regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAcquisitions or strategic investments may not generate the results expected and could be difficult to integrate, divert the attention of key personnel, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and impair our financial results.\nIn December 2015, we acquired certain assets of Spirit Corp LLC (\u201cSpirit\u201d) and its affiliates involved in the development of navigation solutions. In July 2014, we acquired 100% equity interest of Movea, S.A., (\u201cMovea\u201d) a French company based in Grenoble, France. In August 2014, we completed the acquisition of Trusted Positioning, Inc., (\u201cTPI\u201d), a Canadian corporation based in Calgary, Canada. In October 2013, we concluded the acquisition of the assets of Analog Devices, Inc.\u2019s MEMS microphone business line. We may experience difficulties integrating these operations with ours and may not realize the anticipated value of our investment in the acquired companies.\nWe expect to continue to pursue acquisitions of, or strategic investments into, companies, technologies and products that we believe could accelerate our ability to compete in our core markets or allow us to enter new markets. We may enter into license or cross license agreements with strategic partners or competitors. These and other strategic transactions may involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating the manufacturing, operations, technologies, products, offices, systems, existing contracts, accounting, personnel and culture of acquired business or company and realizing the anticipated synergies of the combined businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in supporting and transitioning customers, if any, of the acquired business or company;\n\u2022\ndiversion of financial and management resources from our existing operations;\n\u2022\nthe effect license and cross license agreements can have on our competitive position in our markets;\n\u2022\nthe price we pay or other resources that we devote may exceed the value we actually realize, or the value we could have realized if we had allocated the purchase price or other resources to another opportunity or for our existing operations;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience, including risks related to technology, customers, competitors, product cycles, customer demand, terms and conditions and other industry specific issues;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees;\n\u2022\ncustomers, potential customers or strategic partners from either our current business or the acquired business may terminate or scale back their business relationships with us for many reasons, including to reduce reliance on a single company or because they view the combined businesses as potentially competitive;\n\u2022\nassumption of unanticipated problems or latent liabilities, such as problems with the quality of the acquired company\u2019s products;\n\u2022\ninability to generate sufficient revenue and profitability to offset acquisition costs;\n\u2022\nequity-based acquisitions may have a dilutive effect on our stock; and\n\u2022\ninability to successfully consummate transactions with identified acquisition or investment candidates.\nFurther, there can be no assurance that any acquisition or license agreements we consummate will generate the expected returns and other projected results we anticipate. For example, we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate, the acquisitions of product lines with lower operating margins than our existing business may reduce our overall lower operating margins, and acquisitions frequently result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to potential impairments in the future that could harm our financial results. In addition, we could use substantial portions of our available cash or, subject to provisions of any existing indebtedness we have, incur additional debt, or issue additional equity securities in order to finance acquisitions, the result of which may be to constrain our access to cash for other purposes or result in dilution to our existing stockholders. As a result of these and other risks, if we fail to manage the pursuit, consummation and integration of acquisitions or license agreements effectively, our business could suffer.\nOur sales are subject to a competitive selection process conducted by our prospective customers that can be lengthy and require us to expend significant resources, even though we ultimately may not be selected and revenue from being selected may be lower than anticipated.\nThe process of identifying potential new customers, developing their interest in our products, moving through their design cycle, obtaining a design win, obtaining purchase orders and entering into volume production is extremely time consuming. We compete during our customers\u2019 product design and planning processes to achieve \u201cdesign wins,\u201d which refers to a customer\u2019s decision to include one of our solutions in its products under development. These selection processes can be lengthy and time-sensitive and can require us to invest significant time and effort. Our products may not be selected during a customer\u2019s design process, and we may not generate net revenue despite incurring expenses and devoting significant resources to achieving a design win, even after the customer has made its adverse selection but failed to inform us. Because the life cycles for our customers\u2019 products can last several years and changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk, our failure to be selected in a competitive design process can result in our foregoing net revenue from a given customer\u2019s product line for the life of that product.\nTypically, many customers, including most of our current customers, initially include our products in only one or a few product lines. It generally takes time for sales volumes of a new product line to grow and for customers to incorporate one of our solutions into additional product lines, if any. Even after we achieve a design win, a customer may decide to cancel or change its product plans, may fail to commercialize its products, or those products may fail to achieve market acceptance, any of which could cause us to fail to generate sales from a particular design win and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, large consumer electronics companies often elect to establish more than one source for components to promote competition and control risks of supply interruption. Such \u201cdual source\u201d strategies can result in lower sales from a design win than anticipated. Further, failure to achieve design wins could result in lost sales and hurt our prospects in future competitive selection processes because we may not be perceived as a preferred or competitive vendor.\nOur debt obligations may be a burden on our future cash flows and cash resources.\nIn November 2013, we issued $175 million of 1.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (the \u201cNotes\u201d). Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance the Notes or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on the Notes or future indebtedness.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock in connection with the conversion of the Notes, and thereby dilute our existing stockholders and potentially adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the event that some or all of the Notes are converted into common stock, the ownership interests of existing stockholders will be diluted, and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issuable upon such conversion of the Notes could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. In addition, the anticipated conversion of the Notes could depress the market price of our common stock.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification 470-20 (ASC 470-20), Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which we refer to as ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet at the issuance date and the value of the equity component is treated as debt discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result, we are required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense from the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Notes to their face amount over the term of the Notes. We have and will report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes.\nThe make-whole fundamental change provisions of the Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.\nIf a make-whole fundamental change such as an acquisition of our company occurs prior to the maturity of the Notes, under certain circumstances, the conversion rate for the Notes will increase such that additional shares of our common stock will be issued upon conversion of the Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. The increase in the conversion rate will be determined based on the date on which the make-whole fundamental change occurs or becomes effective and the price paid (or deemed paid) per share of our common stock in such transaction. This increase will be dilutive to our existing stockholders. Our obligation to increase the conversion rate upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change may, in certain circumstances, delay or prevent a takeover of us that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile, and stockholders may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price they originally paid.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. For example since our initial public offering through April 3, 2016, the closing price of our common stock has ranged from $6.81 to $25.85. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, factors that may cause volatility in our stock price include:\n\u2022\nour small public float relative to the total number of shares of common stock that are issued and outstanding;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\u2022\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u2022\nthe expiration of the contractual lock-up and market stand-off agreements;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our results of operations, those of our competitors or those of our largest customers;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, design wins, new solutions, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of related markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and market new and enhanced solutions on a timely basis;\n\u2022\ndisruption to our operations;\n\u2022\nthe emergence of new sales channels in which we are unable to compete effectively;\n\u2022\nany change in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates including our ability to meet our future net revenue and operating profit or loss projections;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\ncommencement of, or our involvement in, litigation; and\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for semiconductor and other technology companies in particular, have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. These trading price fluctuations may also make it more difficult for us to use our common stock as a means to make acquisitions or to use equity-related compensation to attract and retain employees.\nWe are currently the subject of securities class action litigation and we could be the subject of such litigation in the future due to stock price volatility, which could divert management\u2019s attention and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe stock market in general, and market prices for the securities of technology companies like ours in particular, have from time to time experienced volatility. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In several recent situations where the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. We are currently, and in the future may be, the target of this type of litigation, see Item 3 Legal Proceedings. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. If any of our stockholders were to bring additional lawsuits against us, the defense and disposition of these lawsuits could be costly and divert the time and attention of our management and harm our operating results.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law and measures imposed by regulatory authorities to protect national security could discourage or prohibit a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended and restated, may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nthe right of our board of directors to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe establishment of a classified board of directors requiring that only a subset of the members of our board of directors be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe prohibition of cumulative voting in our election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that stockholders provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to our board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock with terms set by the board of directors, which rights could be senior to those of our common stock. The ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us;\n\u2022\nthe required approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to repeal or adopt any provision of our certificate of incorporation regarding the election of directors;\n\u2022\nthe required approval of the holders of at least 80% of such shares to amend or repeal the provisions of our bylaws regarding the election and classification of directors; and\n\u2022\nthe required approval of the holders of at least a majority of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors to remove directors without cause.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\nA number of companies in our industry have been acquired by foreign entities, subjecting such transactions to regulatory review. The Committee of Foreign Investment in the United States (\u201cCFIUS\u201d) has previously stated that there may be national security concerns when considering foreign control of semiconductor manufacturers. CFIUS is a U.S. government inter-agency committee authorized to review proposed transactions that could result in control of U.S. businesses by foreign entities and affect U.S. national security. There is no certainty that a CFIUS challenge to a transaction will not be made or that CFIUS clearance will be obtained or that CFIUS clearance would not be conditioned upon actions that would be materially adverse to us or other entities involved in a transaction.", "PERMNO": 13081, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "INVN"}
