{"cik": "1046203", "company": "GUARANTY FEDERAL BANCSHARES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business and operations are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, certain risks and uncertainties. An investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included and incorporated by reference in this report. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nOur business is concentrated in and largely dependent upon the continued growth and welfare of the general geographical markets in which we operate.\nOur operations are heavily concentrated in Greene County and Christian County, which are in the southwestern corner of Missouri, including the cities of Springfield, Nixa and Ozark, Missouri (our \u201cMarket Area\u201d). Our success depends to a significant extent upon the business activity, population, income levels, deposits and real estate activity in these markets. Although our customers' business and financial interests may extend well beyond these market areas, adverse economic conditions that affect these market areas could reduce our growth rate, affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans to us, affect the value of collateral underlying loans and generally affect our financial condition and results of operations. Because of our geographic concentration, we are less able than other regional or national financial institutions to diversify our credit risks across multiple markets.\nOur loan/lease portfolio possesses increased risk due to our relatively high concentration of real estate loans, which involve risks specific to real estate values.\nReal estate lending comprises a significant portion of our lending business. Real estate loans were $396.1 million, or approximately 79% of our total loan/lease portfolio, as of December 31, 2015. The market value of real estate securing our real estate loans can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in our Market Area which is where most of the real estate on which our real estate loans are made is located. Adverse developments affecting real estate values in our Market Area could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio. Additionally, real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of the loans generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Economic events or governmental regulations outside of our control or that of our borrowers could negatively impact the future cash flow and market values of the affected properties impairing the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans which could materially and adversely affect the Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operations depending on the severity of the economic downturn or the nature of the regulatory changes.\nDeterioration in asset quality could have an adverse impact on our business.\nA significant source of risk for us arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers, guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans. With respect to secured loans, the collateral securing the repayment of these loans includes a wide variety of diverse real and personal property that may be affected by changes in prevailing economic, environmental and other conditions, including declines in the value of real estate, changes in interest rates, changes in monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, environmental contamination (as discussed in more detail below) and other external events. In addition, decreases in real estate values due to the nature of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio (discussed above) could affect the ability of customers to repay their loans. The Bank\u2019s loan policies and procedures may not prevent unexpected losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation or liquidity.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with real estate collateral securing our loans.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. Under certain circumstances, we may take title to the real property collateral through foreclosure or other means. As the titleholder of the property, we may be responsible for environmental risks, such as hazardous materials, which attach to the property. For these reasons, prior to extending credit, we conduct an environmental review to identify any known environmental risks associated with the real property that will secure our loans. In addition, we routinely inspect properties prior to foreclosing. If environmental risks are found, environmental laws and regulations may prescribe our approach to remediation. As a result, while we have ownership of a property, we may incur substantial expense and bear potential liability for any damages caused. The environmental risks may also materially reduce the property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the property. We also cannot guarantee that our environmental review will detect all environmental issues relating to a property, which could subject us to additional liability.\nOur loan portfolio possesses increased risk due to the percentage of commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans.\nOur loan portfolio includes a significant amount of commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans. The credit risk related to these types of loans is considered to be greater than the risk related to owner-occupied residential real estate loans or consumer loans because commercial loans often have larger balances, and repayment usually depends on the borrowers\u2019 successful business operations. The underlying commercial real estate values, customer cash flow and payment expectations on such loans can be more easily influenced by adverse conditions in the related industries, the real estate market or in the economy in general. Any significant deterioration in the credit quality of the commercial loan portfolio or underlying collateral values would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry.\nWe face competition in attracting and retaining deposits, making loans, and providing other financial services throughout our market area. Our competitors include other community banks, regional and super-regional banking institutions, national banking institutions, and a wide range of other financial institutions such as credit unions, government-sponsored enterprises, mutual fund companies, insurance companies, brokerage companies, and other non-bank businesses. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources than we do and are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as we are. Many of our competitors compete across geographic boundaries and are able to provide customers with a feasible alternative to traditional banking services.\nAs we try to meet our competitors\u2019 terms and pricing, increased competition in our markets may result in:\n\u25cf\ninterest rate changes to various types of accounts;\n\u25cf\na decrease in the amounts of our loans and deposits;\n\u25cf\nreduced spreads between loan rates and deposit rates; or\n\u25cf\nloan terms that are more favorable to the borrower and less favorable to the bank.\nAny of these results could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and remain profitable. If increased competition causes us to significantly discount the interest rates we offer on loans or increase the amount we pay on deposits, our net interest income could be adversely impacted.\nOur operations are concentrated in one subsidiary bank; an event or a series of events having a material adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations of the Bank would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation and, accordingly, on your investment in us.\nAs a holding company with only one subsidiary bank, our investment risk is concentrated in just one primary operating asset in a relatively small geographic location. A substantial portion of our cash flow comes from dividends paid directly to us by the Bank. If and to the extent our Bank is not successful or an event were to occur that prevents it or hinders it from operating effectively, our financial condition and results of operation could be materially and adversely impacted. Larger bank holding companies with more subsidiary banks or bank facilities and which are more geographically dispersed are not as susceptible to the concentrated risks we are if one of their subsidiary banks or facilities was not able to operate effectively.\nCybersecurity threats and privacy breaches could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities.\nOur operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment not only against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, but also from security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our communication and information systems may present security risks due to susceptibility of digitally stored information to hacking or identity theft. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us. This could also result in damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems and products.\nOur information security risks have increased recently in part because of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunication technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists, and others. While we have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures and interruptions, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do. In addition, with the help of third-party service providers, we intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such damage. Nevertheless, we may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventative measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. In addition, our security measures may not be able to detect all cyber threats and therefore there is a risk that data breaches may go undetected for extended periods of time.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are dependent upon outside third parties for processing and handling of our records and data.\nWe rely on third party vendors for a substantial portion of our communications, record retention, operations and financial control systems technology. While we place a high priority on reliability and competency in our selection of third party vendors, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could materially and adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers or otherwise conduct our business efficiently and effectively. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nIn addition to issues with the services provided by third parties, the vendors we use are also subject to the same cybersecurity risks discussed above. Although we conduct a review of third party vendors prior to contracting with them, we cannot control the security of their systems. Therefore, in addition to cybersecurity threats against us, we are also at risk if our third parties vendors are unable to adequately protect our information. If our data was accessed through information provided to a third party vendor, we could face significant legal and financial exposure and damage to our reputation.\nWe continually encounter technological change, and we cannot predict how changes in technology will affect our business.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than we do. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nRapidly changing interest rate environments could reduce our net interest margin and otherwise negatively impact our results of operations.\nInterest and fees on loans and securities, net of interest paid on deposits and borrowings, are a large part of our net income. Interest rates are the key drivers of our net interest margin and are subject to many factors beyond the control of management. As interest rates change, our net interest income is affected. Rapid increases in interest rates in the future could result in our interest expense increasing faster than interest income because of mismatches in the maturities of our assets and liabilities. Furthermore, substantially higher rates generally reduce loan demand and may result in slower loan growth for us. Decreases or increases in interest rates could have a negative effect on the spreads between our interest rates earned on assets and our rates of interest paid on liabilities, and therefore decrease our net interest income, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nInterest rate changes may affect borrowers\u2019 repayment schedules, negatively impacting our financial condition.\nInterest rate increases often result in larger payment requirements for our borrowers, which increase the potential for default. At the same time, the marketability of underlying collateral may be adversely affected by any reduced demand resulting from higher interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, there may be an increase in prepayments on certain of our loans as borrowers refinance at lower rates. Fluctuation in interest rates may therefore change borrowers\u2019 timing of repayment of, or ability to repay loans, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.\nChanges in interest rates could negatively impact our nonperforming assets, decreasing net interest income.\nChanges in interest rates also can affect the value of loans. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans may lead to an increase in our nonperforming assets and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Further, when we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. Subsequently, we continue to have a cost to fund the loan, which is reflected as interest expense, without any interest income to offset the associated funding expense. Thus, an increase in the amount of nonperforming assets resulting from changes in interest rates would have an adverse impact on net interest income, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nThe financial condition of the Bank\u2019s customers and borrowers could adversely affect the Bank\u2019s liquidity.\nTwo of the Bank\u2019s primary sources of funds are loan repayments and customer deposits. Though scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of liquidity, they are subject to the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans. The ability of the borrowers to repay their loans can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in the economic conditions, adverse trends or events affecting the business environment, natural disasters and various other factors. Customer deposit levels may also be affected by a number of factors, including the competitive interest rate environment in both the national market and our Market Area, local and national economic conditions, natural disasters and other various events. The inability of borrowers to repay their loans or a decline in customer deposits would, depending on the extent of the loan defaults or decline in customer deposits, materially and adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nLiquidity needs could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAdequate liquidity is critical in our ability to meet the needs of our customers. An inability to access funding through customer deposits, available borrowings, sales of loans or investments could have an adverse effect on our liquidity. Furthermore, regional and community banks, including the Bank, generally have less access to the capital markets, than do the national and super-regional banks because of their smaller size and limited analyst coverage. Any significant decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability in the future to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, pay dividends to our stockholders, or fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA decrease in cash flows from our investment portfolio may adversely affect our liquidity.\nAnother primary source of liquidity for the Bank is cash flows from investment securities. Cash flows from the investment portfolio may be affected by changes in interest rates, resulting in excessive levels of cash flow during periods of declining interest rates and lower levels of cash flow during periods of rising interest rates. These changes may be beyond our control and could significantly influence our available cash.\nIf we are required to rely on secondary sources of liquidity, those sources may not be immediately available.\nWe may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations. Such sources include the Federal Home Loan Bank advances, brokered deposits and federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks. Our ability to borrow could be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as severe disruption of the financial markets or negative publicity about the financial services industry as a whole. We may also be required to pledge investments as collateral to borrow money from third parties. In certain cases, we may be required to sell investment instruments for sizable losses to meet liquidity needs, thereby reducing interest income and resultantly net income. While we believe that we are currently sufficiently liquid, there can be no assurance we will not in the future be required to turn to these secondary sources of liquidity which may not be available or only at costs that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nInability to hire or retain certain key professionals, management and staff could adversely affect our revenues, net income and growth plans.\nOur performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals and their ability to attract and retain customer relationships in a community bank environment. We rely on key personnel to manage and operate our business, including major revenue generating functions such as our loan and deposit portfolios. None of our employees, including those who comprise our key management team, are subject to employment contracts with us. Such employees are at-will and thus are not restricted from terminating their employment. The lack of employment contracts with key employees could have a material adverse impact on our ability to retain such employees. The loss of key management or our key loan officers with their contacts in the business communities within our Market Area may adversely affect our ability to maintain and manage these portfolios effectively, which could negatively affect our revenues.\nIf we do struggle with employee retention, our success may also be impacted if we are unable to recruit replacement management and key employees in a reasonable amount of time. There is intense competition in the financial services industry for qualified employees. In addition, loss of key personnel could result in increased recruiting, hiring, and training expenses, resulting in lower net income.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, customer or employee fraud.\nEmployee errors and employee and customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses, regulatory sanctions, lawsuits and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers, or improper use of confidential information. We maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks. However, if our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, such failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation that may significantly affect our operations or earnings.\nWe are subject to significant federal and state regulation and supervision, as discussed in more detail below, which is primarily for the benefit and protection of the Bank\u2019s customers and not for the benefit of investors. As a result, various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends our Bank subsidiary can pay to us without regulatory approval. Our regulatory compliance is costly. We are subject to examination, supervision, and comprehensive regulation by various agencies, including the FRB, the MDF and FDIC. These regulators have broad discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities. We are also subject to capitalization guidelines established by our regulators, as discussed below, which require that we and the Bank maintain adequate capital to support our growth and the Bank\u2019s growth. To the extent our activities and/or the Bank\u2019s activities are restricted or limited by regulation or regulators\u2019 supervisory authority, our future profitability may be adversely affected.\nChanges in federal or state regulation may increase our costs.\nThe laws, regulations, policies, and interpretations that govern our industry are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time. The Dodd-Frank Act reshaped regulation of banking institutions and the numerous requirements stemming from the Dodd-Frank Act have resulted in increased compliance costs for institutions both large and small, including us and the Bank. As these regulations continue to be implemented, interpreted, and enforced, our compliance must evolve as well. The CFPB has shown that it is a proactive agency and we anticipate that the CFPB will continue to expand its supervisory and enforcement authority into new areas and to issue new rules and guidance.\nWe cannot predict the nature or effect of current or proposed legislative or regulatory changes on us or the Bank with any certainty. Changes in laws or regulations could impact our business practices and profitability. We also cannot predict the cost of new compliance that may be required to keep pace with industry regulatory changes.\nDecreases in capital and changes to the formulas for calculating adequate capital may negatively impact us or result in increased regulatory supervision.\nFederal rules require banking institutions to maintain an adequate level of regulatory capital (net assets available to absorb losses). Due to the risks associated with the industry, banking institutions are generally required to hold more capital than other businesses. Revised minimum capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III Rule became effective for us and the Bank on January 1, 2015, with additional requirements, such as the capital conservation buffer (discussed below), to be phased in over the next few years. The new requirements change the definition of capital, increase minimum required risk-based capital ratios, and increase the risk-weights for certain assets. Cumulatively, the Basel III Rule is more stringent than prior requirements and requires financial institutions to hold more and better capital against their assets, decreasing the size of their balance sheets. Although the impact on us has been minimal to date, we cannot guarantee that will continue.\nFinancial institutions must maintain a 2.5% capital conservation buffer comprised of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital above the minimum risk-based capital requirements. The buffer must be maintained in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. If we or the Bank dip below the capital conservation buffer, we or the Bank could be subject to increasingly strict limitations on capital distributions and bonus payments.\nFederal law provides regulators with broad powers to take \"prompt corrective action\" to resolve capital deficiencies at insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. There are five capital tiers: \"well capitalized,\" \"adequately capitalized,\" \"undercapitalized,\" \"significantly undercapitalized\" and \"critically undercapitalized.\" As an institution\u2019s capital levels deteriorates and it falls below the \u201cwell capitalized\u201d threshold, such institution faces increasing penalties. Regulator\u2019s corrective powers include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\nrequiring a waiver to accept brokered deposits;\n\u25cf\nrequiring submission of a capital plan;\n\u25cf\nlimiting growth or restricting activities;\n\u25cf\nrequiring the issuance of additional capital stock;\n\u25cf\nrestricting transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf\nprohibiting executive bonuses or raises;\n\u25cf\nprohibiting the payment of subordinated debt; and\n\u25cf\nappointing a receiver.\nAccordingly, we and the Bank could be subject to regulatory penalties and restrictions if capital falls below a certain minimum thresholds.\nManagement\u2019s analysis of the necessary funding for the allowance for loan loss account may be incorrect or may suddenly change resulting in lower earnings.\nThe funding of the allowance for loan loss account is the most significant estimate made by management in its financial reporting to stockholders and regulators. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which are subject to material changes.\nAlthough management believes that the allowance for loan/lease losses as of December 31, 2015 was adequate to absorb losses on any existing loans/leases that may become uncollectible, we cannot predict loan losses with certainty, and we cannot assure you that our allowance for loan losses will prove sufficient to cover actual loan losses in the future, particularly if economic conditions are more difficult than management currently expects. If negative changes to the performance of our loan portfolio were to occur, management may find it necessary to or be required to fund the allowance for loan loss account through additional charges to our provision for loan loss expense. These changes may occur suddenly and be dramatic in nature. Additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses and loan losses in excess of said allowance may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, including economic conditions specifically in our Market Area, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe effects of the monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve upon our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future cannot be predicted, but have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks, including our Bank, in the past.\nAnti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our stockholders.\nProvisions in our governing documents, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) and federal regulations could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us, despite the possible benefit to our stockholders. These provisions include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\na prohibition on voting shares of common stock beneficially owned in excess of 10% of total shares outstanding without prior Board approval;\n\u25cf\nsupermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations with any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of our outstanding common stock;\n\u25cf\nthe election of directors to staggered terms of three years;\n\u25cf\nadvance notice requirements for director nominations and for proposing matters that stockholders may act on at stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf\na requirement that only directors may fill a vacancy in our Board of Directors; and\n\u25cf\nsupermajority voting requirements to remove any of our directors.\nIn addition, because we are a bank holding company, purchasers of 10% or more of our common stock may be required to obtain approvals under the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, or the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the \u201cBHCA\u201d), and in certain cases such approvals may be required at a lesser percentage of ownership.\nThese provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for holders of our common stock to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our Board of Directors.\nThere are restrictions on our ability to pay dividends on and repurchase our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors. Our ability to pay dividends is limited by Delaware law, as well as regulatory restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient consolidated capital. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us is limited by its obligation to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity and by other general restrictions on dividends that are applicable to the Bank. If current or any future regulatory requirements are not met, the Bank will not be able to pay dividends to us, and we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock.\nThe DGCL provides that dividends by a Delaware corporation may be paid only from: (1) \u201csurplus\u201d determined in the manner described in the DGCL, or (2) in case there is no \u201csurplus,\u201d net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Dividends paid from the second source may not be paid unless the capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets at current market value is intact.\nMoreover, as a bank holding company, our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends. The Federal Reserve guidelines generally require us to review the effects of the cash payment of dividends on common stock and other Tier 1 capital instruments (i.e., perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred debt) in light of our earnings, capital adequacy and financial condition. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve indicates that the Board of Directors of a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce the dividends if:\n\u25cf\nthe company\u2019s net income available to stockholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends;\n\u25cf\nthe prospective rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company\u2019s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or\n\u25cf\nthe company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.\nIn the future, if we default on certain of our outstanding debts, we will be prohibited from making dividend payments on our common stock until such payments have been brought current.\nFailure to pay interest on our debt may adversely impact our ability to pay common stock dividends.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $15.5 million of junior subordinated debentures held by two business trusts. Interest payments on the Company\u2019s existing debentures, which totaled $539,000 for 2015, must be paid before the Company can pay dividends on its capital stock, including its common stock. The Company has the right to defer interest payments on the debentures for up to 20 consecutive quarters. However, if it elects to defer interest payments, all deferred interest must be paid before the Company can pay dividends on its capital stock.\nAlthough the Company expects to be able to pay all required interest on the junior subordinated debentures, there is no guarantee that it will be able to do so.\nThere is a limited trading market for our common stock, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.\nAlthough our common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market, it has a low average daily trading volume relative to many other stocks whose shares are also quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the market of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. We cannot assure you that the volume of trading in our common stock will increase in the future.\nAdditionally, general market forces may have a negative effect on our stock price, independent of factors affecting our stock specifically. Factors beyond our control, including price and trading fluctuation, can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These conditions may result in (i) volatility in the level of, and fluctuations in, the market prices of stocks generally and, in turn, our common stock and (ii) sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the market, in each case that could be unrelated or disproportionate to changes in our operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market value of our common stock.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could negatively affect our business.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be negatively affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions, including the Bank, are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and losses of depositor, creditor and counterparty confidence and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. We could experience increases in deposits and assets as a result of the difficulties or failures of other banks, which would increase the capital we need to support our growth. There can be no assurance that we could raise the necessary capital to support our growth or on terms satisfactory to us.\nWe face legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against us.\nWe could in the future become subject to lawsuits or regulatory proceedings challenging the legality of our lending or business practices. Future actions against us may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to us, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm to us. As a participant in the financial services industry, we are exposed to a high level of potential litigation related to our businesses and operations. Although we maintain insurance, the scope of this coverage may not provide us with full, or even partial, coverage in any particular case.\nOur businesses and operations are also subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. These and other initiatives from federal and state officials may subject us to further judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause us to be required to restructure our operations and activities, all of which could lead to reputational issues, or higher operational costs, thereby reducing our revenue.\nOur reputation could be damaged by negative publicity.\nReputational risk, or the risk to us from negative publicity, is inherent in our business. Negative publicity can result from actual or alleged conduct in a number of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, inadequate protection of customer data, ethical behavior of our employees, and from actions taken by regulators, ratings agencies and others as a result of that conduct. Damage to our reputation could impact our ability to attract new or maintain existing loan and deposit customers, employees and business relationships.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments, which are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and which may differ from actual results.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and general reporting practices within the U.S. financial services industry, which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Some accounting policies, such as those pertaining to our allowance for loan losses, require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions. If actual results vary significantly, there may be a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in subsequent periods.", "PERMNO": 81560, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "GFED"}
