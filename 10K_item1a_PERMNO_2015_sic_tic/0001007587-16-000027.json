{"cik": "1007587", "company": "KVH INDUSTRIES INC \\DE\\", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRisk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating our business. If any of these risks, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not significant, develops into an actual event, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. If that happens, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nOur revenues and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by worldwide economic turmoil, credit tightening and associated declines in consumer spending.\nWorldwide economic conditions have experienced significant turmoil over the last several years, including slower economic activity, tightened credit markets, inflation and deflation concerns, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits, reduced or canceled capital spending, adverse business conditions, and liquidity concerns. These conditions make it difficult for businesses, governments and consumers to accurately forecast and plan future activities. Many governments are experiencing significant deficits that have caused and may continue to cause them to curtail spending significantly and/or reallocate funds away from defense programs. There can be no assurances that government responses to the disruptions in the economy will remedy these problems. As a result of these and other factors, customers could continue to slow or suspend spending on our products and services. We may also incur increased credit losses and need to further increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, which would have a negative impact on our earnings and financial condition.\nWe cannot predict the timing, duration, or ultimate impact of the turmoil in our markets. We expect our business to continue to be adversely impacted by this turmoil, particularly in Europe and South America.\nDeclining oil prices may continue to adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nOil prices have undergone a significant and sustained decline during 2015 and continuing into 2016. Customers of our mobile satellite business include offshore support vessels companies that participate in, or are dependent upon, the offshore oil industry. The declines in worldwide oil prices have had a significant impact on the financial performance of companies in this sector of the economy, and as a result demand for new products and services has declined severely during and since 2015 as they have sought to reduce expenditures. In addition, we have experienced a higher customer churn rate primarily attributed to customers that operate in this sector, where the sale or decommissioning of vessels has led to a higher rate of airtime plan terminations. These trends could continue to limit or reduce demand for our satellite antenna products and airtime services from companies in this sector, which could continue to adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nOur financial performance is impacted by U.S. government contracts, which are subject to uncertain levels of funding and termination.\nWe have historically sold a substantial portion of our TACNAV and FOG systems and we currently sell tactical navigation products and services to the U.S. government and its contractors. A reduction in sales to the U.S. government or its contractors, whether due to lack of funding, for convenience or otherwise, or the occurrence of delays, could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, the funding of U.S. government programs is subject to congressional appropriations. Congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may extend over several fiscal years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. If appropriations for any program in which we participate become unavailable, or are reduced or delayed, our contract or subcontract under such program may be terminated or adjusted by the government, which could have a negative impact on our future sales under such contract or subcontract. When a formal appropriation bill has not been signed into law before the end of the U.S. government's fiscal year, which has become more frequent in recent years, Congress may pass a continuing resolution that authorizes agencies of the U.S. government to continue to operate, generally at the same funding levels from the prior year, but that typically does not authorize new spending initiatives, during this period. Appropriations can also be impacted by other budgetary considerations, such as failure to increase the statutory debt ceiling of the U.S. government. During such periods (or until the regular appropriation bills are passed), delays can occur in procurement of products and services due to lack of funding, and these delays can affect our results of operations during the period of delay.\nAppropriations can also be affected by legislation that addresses larger budgetary issues of the U.S. government. For example, future federal sequestration measures could continue to adversely affect federal spending across the U.S. government, including the Department of Defense, and we expect that these measures will continue to limit or reduce defense spending.\nIn addition, U.S. government contracts generally also permit the government to terminate the contract, in whole or in part, without prior notice, at the government's convenience or for default based on performance. Government customers can\nalso decline to exercise previously disclosed contract options. If one of our contracts is terminated for convenience, we would generally be entitled to payments for our allowable costs and would receive some allowance for profit on the work performed. If one of our contracts is terminated for default, we would generally be entitled to payments for our work that has been accepted by the government. A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and adversely affect our ability to obtain future contracts and orders. Furthermore, on contracts for which we are a subcontractor and not the prime contractor, the U.S. government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, irrespective of our performance as a subcontractor.\nWe must generate a certain level of sales of the TracPhone V-IP series products and our mini-VSAT Broadband service in order to maintain or improve our service gross margins.\nAs a result of our mini-VSAT Broadband network infrastructure, our cost of service sales includes certain fixed costs that do not generally vary with the volume of service sales, and we have almost no ability to reduce these fixed costs in the short term. These fixed costs have increased significantly each year as we have further expanded our network to accommodate additional subscriber demand and/or coverage areas, and we expect that this trend will continue in 2016 and beyond. If sales of our TracPhone V-IP series products and the mini-VSAT Broadband service do not generate the level of revenue that we expect or decline, our service gross margins may decline. As our market share has increased, we have also experienced a general increase in customer termination rates, compounded by accelerated declines in sales for vessels servicing the oil supply market, and lower unit sales of our mobile communications hardware, both in the United States and Europe. The failure to improve our mini-VSAT Broadband service gross margins and unit sales would have a material adverse effect on our overall profitability.\nCompetition may limit our ability to sell our mobile communications products and services and guidance and stabilization products.\nThe mobile communications markets and defense navigation, and guidance and stabilization markets in which we participate are very competitive, and we expect this competition to persist and intensify in the future. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, which could impair our ability to sell our products. For example, improvements in the performance of lower cost gyros by competitors could potentially jeopardize sales of our FOGs and FOG-based systems. As our market share in the mobile satellite communications market has grown, competition has intensified significantly, most notably from companies that seek to compete primarily on price. These companies may continue to implement price reductions and discounts for both products and services, which have required us to reduce our prices or offer discounts in order to maintain or increase our market share. We anticipate that this trend of substantial competition will continue.\nIn the marine market for satellite TV equipment, we compete primarily with Intellian, Cobham SATCOM, Orbit Communication Systems, RayMarine (Intellian made), KNS, and Sea King (King Controls).\nIn the marine market for voice, fax, data, and Internet communications equipment, we compete primarily with Intellian, Cobham SATCOM, Orbit Communication Systems, Jotron AS, KNS Inc., Inmarsat, AddValue, and Iridium Satellite LLC.\nIn the marine market for voice, fax, data, and Internet services, we compete primarily with Inmarsat, Globalstar LP, and Iridium Satellite LLC. We also face competition from providers of marine satellite data services and maritime VSAT solutions, including Inmarsat (and its recently launched Global Xpress service), Marlink, MTN/SeaMobile, Speedcast, and CapRock. We believe that certain customers have deferred purchase decisions in anticipation of the Global Xpress rollout, which is reducing demand in this market.\nIn the market for land mobile satellite TV equipment, we compete primarily with King Controls and Winegard Company.\nIn the markets for media content, the KVH Media Group competes primarily with Swank Motion Pictures and NewspaperDirect, and Videotel competes with Seagull AS.\nIn the guidance and stabilization markets, we compete primarily with Honeywell International Inc., Northrop Grumman Corporation, Goodrich Aerospace, IAI, Fizoptica, SAGEM, and Systron Donner Inertial.\nAmong the factors that may affect our ability to compete in our markets are the following:\n\u2022\nmany of our primary competitors are well-established companies that generally have substantially greater financial, managerial, technical, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do, which help them to compete more effectively in the market for mobile broadband solutions for larger fleets of vessels;\n\u2022\nproduct and service improvements, new product and service developments or price reductions by competitors may weaken customer acceptance of, and reduce demand for, our products and services;\n\u2022\nnew technology or market trends may disrupt or displace a need for our products and services;\n\u2022\nour competitors may have access to a broader array of media content than we do, which may cause customers to prefer competitors\u2019 media offerings; and\n\u2022\nour competitors may have lower production costs than we do, which may enable them to compete more aggressively in offering discounts and other promotions.\nThe emergence of a competing small maritime VSAT antenna and complementary service or other similar service could reduce the competitive advantage we believe we currently enjoy with our smaller TracPhone V-IP series antennas and Ku-band mini-VSAT Broadband service, or with our C/Ku-band mini-VSAT Broadband service and our TracPhone V11-IP antenna.\nOur TracPhone V3-IP and V7-IP systems offer customers a range of benefits due to their integrated design, hardware costs that are lower than existing maritime Ku-band VSAT systems, and spread spectrum technology. We currently compete against companies that offer established maritime Ku-band VSAT service using, in some cases, antennas 1-meter in diameter or larger. While we are unaware of any company offering a 37-cm VSAT solution comparable to our TracPhone V3-IP, we are encountering regional competition from companies offering 60-cm VSAT systems and services, which are comparable in size to our TracPhone V7-IP. Likewise, our TracPhone V11-IP, at 1.1-meter in diameter, is approximately 85% smaller and lighter than competing C-band maritime VSAT systems, which uses antennas in excess of 2.4-meters in diameter to provide similar global services. We are unaware of any competitor currently offering a similar size solution for global C-band coverage, but any introduction of such a product could adversely impact our success. In addition, other companies could replicate some of the distinguishing features of our TracPhone V-IP series products, which could potentially reduce the appeal of our solution, increase price competition, and adversely affect sales. For example, Inmarsat has recently launched its Global Xpress service, a new global Ka-band mobile VSAT service that Inmarsat claims will be faster and have a lower price per megabit than existing Ku-band services. This service may adversely impact sales of our mini-VSAT Broadband service and related equipment. Moreover, consumers may choose other services such as FleetBroadband or Iridium OpenPort for their service coverage at potentially lower hardware costs despite higher service costs and slower data rates.\nIf we are unable to improve our existing mobile communications and guidance and stabilization products and services and develop new, innovative products and services, our sales and market share may decline.\nThe markets for mobile communications products and services and guidance and stabilization products and services are each characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product innovations, changes in customer requirements and expectations, and evolving industry standards. If we fail to make innovations in our existing products and services and reduce the costs of our products and services in a timely way, our market share may decline. For example, the introductions of our new TracVision TV-series antennas in 2014 occurred later than we had anticipated, which we believe led certain customers to purchase competing products. Products or services using new technologies, or emerging industry standards, could render our products and services obsolete. If our competitors successfully introduce new or enhanced products or services that eliminate technological advantages our products or services may have in a market or otherwise outperform our products or services, or are perceived by consumers as doing so, we may be unable to compete successfully in the markets affected by these changes. For competitive reasons, last year we increased warranty coverage for certain of our mobile communications products to include an additional year of labor coverage and other benefits, which could increase our costs and impair our profitability.\nThe purchasing and delivery schedules and priorities of the U.S. military and foreign governments are often unpredictable.\nWe sell our FOG systems and tactical navigation products and services to U.S. and foreign military and government customers, either directly or as a subcontractor to other contractors. These customers often use a competitive bidding process and have unique purchasing and delivery requirements, which often makes the timing of sales to these customers unpredictable. Factors that affect their purchasing and delivery decisions include:\n\u2022\nincreasing budgetary pressures, which may reduce or delay funding for military programs;\n\u2022\nchanges in modernization plans for military equipment;\n\u2022\nchanges in tactical navigation requirements;\n\u2022\nglobal conflicts impacting troop deployment, including troop withdrawals from the Middle East and Afghanistan;\n\u2022\npriorities for current battlefield operations;\n\u2022\nnew military and operational doctrines that affect military equipment needs;\n\u2022\nsales cycles that are long and difficult to predict;\n\u2022\nshifting response time and/or delays in the approval process associated with the export licenses we must obtain prior to the international shipment of certain of our military products;\n\u2022\ndelays in military procurement schedules; and\n\u2022\ndelays in the testing and acceptance of our products, including delays resulting from changes in customer specifications.\nThese factors periodically cause substantial fluctuations in sales of our TACNAV and FOG products from period to period. For example, sales of our FOG products decreased $1.6 million, or 8%, from 2014 to 2015. Similarly, TACNAV service sales decreased $0.8 million, or 21%, from 2014 to 2015, while sales of our TACNAV products decreased $3.6 million, or 20%, from 2014 to 2015. However, in October 2014, we received a $19.0 million TACNAV product and services contract with an international military customer which include program management and engineering services expected to be delivered through 2017 and hardware shipments expected to be fulfilled in 2016, as well as out-year support services to be provided as part of this order. These large orders contribute to the unpredictability of our revenues from period to period. Government customers may change defense spending priorities at any time.\nSales of our FOG systems and TACNAV products generally consist of a few large orders, and the delay or cancellation of a single order could substantially reduce our net sales.\nKVH products sold to customers in the defense industry are purchased through orders that can generally range in size from several hundred thousand dollars to more than thirty million dollars. For example, we received orders for TACNAV products and services of $1.3 million, $1.4 million, $1.5 million, $4.3 million, $19.0 million, $5.2 million, $7.2 million, $35.6 million, and $2.8 million in November 2015, September 2015, May 2015, November 2014, October 2014, May 2014, January 2013, September 2012, and September 2012, respectively. Orders of this size are often unpredictable and difficult to replicate. As a result, the delay or cancellation of a single order could materially reduce our net sales and results of operations. We periodically experience repeated and unanticipated delays in defense orders, which make our revenues and operating results less predictable. Because our guidance and stabilization products typically have relatively higher product gross margins than our mobile communications products, the loss of an order for guidance and stabilization products could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOnly a few customers account for a substantial portion of our defense navigation and guidance and stabilization revenues, and the loss of any of these customers could substantially reduce our net sales.\nWe derive a significant portion of our guidance and stabilization revenues from a small number of customers, many of whom are contractors for the U.S. government. In October 2014, we received a $19.0 million TACNAV product and services contract from an international military customer which includes program management and engineering services expected to be delivered through 2017 and hardware shipments that were partially fulfilled in 2015 with the remainder expected to be fulfilled in 2016 as well as out-year support services to be provided as part of this order. The loss of business from any of these customers could substantially reduce our net sales and results of operations and could seriously harm our business. Since we are often awarded a contract as a subcontractor to a major defense supplier that is engaged in a competitive bidding process as prime contractor for a major weapons procurement program, our revenues depend significantly on the success of the prime contractors with which we align ourselves.\nCommercial sales of our guidance and stabilization products are unpredictable.\nFluctuating commercial sales of our guidance and stabilization products are making it more difficult to predict our future revenues. We have been marketing our guidance and stabilization products, particularly our FOG products and systems, to original equipment manufacturers for incorporation into commercial products, such as navigation and positioning systems for various applications, including precision mapping, dynamic surveying, autonomous vehicles, train location control and track geometry measurement systems, industrial robotics, and optical stabilization. Because we sell these products to original equipment manufacturers rather than end-users, we have less information about market trends and other developments affecting the buying patterns of end-users and, as a result, may be unable to forecast demand for these products accurately. Sales of FOGs for commercial applications decreased from 2014 to 2015; however, sales can significantly increase or decrease quarter-to-quarter due to our customer mix. Moreover, sales of these products for commercial applications depend on the success of our customers\u2019 products, and any decline in sales of our customers\u2019 products would reduce demand for our products.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by unseasonably cold weather, prolonged winter conditions, disasters or similar events.\nOur marine leisure business is highly seasonal, and seasonality can also impact our commercial marine business. Historically, we have generated the majority of our marine leisure product revenues during the first and second quarters of each year, and these revenues typically decline in the third and fourth quarters of each year, compared to the first two quarters. Temporary suspensions of our airtime services typically increase in the third and fourth quarters of each year as boats are placed out of service during winter months. Our marine leisure business is also significantly affected by the weather. Unseasonably cool weather, prolonged winter conditions, hurricanes, unusual amounts of rain, and natural and other disasters may decrease boating, which could reduce our revenues. Specifically, we may encounter a decrease in new airtime activations as well as an increase in the number of cancellations or temporary suspensions of our airtime service.\nWe could derive an increasing portion of our revenues from commercial leases of mobile communications equipment, rather than sales, which could increase our credit and collection risk.\nWe are actively seeking to increase revenues from the commercial markets for our mini-VSAT Broadband service, particularly shipping companies and other companies that deploy a fleet of vessels. In marketing this service, we offer leasing arrangements for the TracPhone antennas to both commercial and leisure customers. If commercial leases become increasingly popular with our customers, we could face increased risks of default under those leases. Defaults could increase our costs of collection (including costs of retrieving or abandoning leased equipment) and reduce the amount we collect from customers, which could harm our results of operations. Moreover, fleet sales are likely to be less common than, and perhaps substantially larger than, our typical orders, which could lead to increased variability in our quarterly revenues and gross margin realization.\nOur ability to compete in the maritime airtime services market may be impaired if we are unable to provide sufficient service capacity to meet customer demand.\nThe TracPhone V-IP series products and our mini-VSAT Broadband service offer a range of benefits to mariners, especially in commercial markets, due to the smaller size antenna and faster, more affordable airtime. We currently offer service in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia-Pacific, and Australian and New Zealand waters. In the future, we may need to expand capacity in existing coverage areas to support an expanding subscriber base. If we are unable to reach agreement with third-party satellite providers to support the mini-VSAT Broadband service and its spread spectrum technology or transponder capacity is unavailable should we need to increase our capacity to meet growing demand in a given region, our ability to support vessels and aeronautical applications globally will be at risk and could reduce the attractiveness of our products and services to these customers.\nTight credit availability, environmental concerns and ongoing low levels of consumer confidence are adversely affecting sales of our mobile satellite TV products.\nFactors such as tight credit, environmental protection laws and ongoing low levels of consumer confidence can materially and adversely affect sales of larger vehicles and vessels for which our mobile satellite TV products are designed. Many customers finance their purchases of these vehicles and vessels, and tightened credit availability can reduce demand for both these vehicles and vessels and our mobile satellite TV products. Moreover, in the current credit markets, financing for these purchases has sometimes been unavailable or more difficult to obtain. The increased cost of operating these vehicles and vessels can adversely affect demand for our mobile satellite TV products. Recent declines in oil prices may not result in any material increase in demand.\nOur business has substantial indebtedness, which could restrict our business opportunities.\nWe currently have, and will likely continue to have, a substantial amount of indebtedness. Our indebtedness could, among other things, make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations, require us to use a large portion of our cash flow from operations to repay and service our debt or otherwise create liquidity problems, limit our flexibility to adjust to market conditions, place us at a competitive disadvantage and expose us to interest rate fluctuations. As of December 31, 2015, we had total debt outstanding of $64.7 million, which included $58.9 million in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under our term note that matures in 2019.\nWe expect to obtain the money to pay our expenses and pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness from cash flow from our operations and potentially from other debt or equity offerings. Accordingly, our ability to meet our obligations depends on our future performance and capital raising activities, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources prove inadequate to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations, restructure or refinance our debt, which we may be unable to do on\nacceptable terms, and forego attractive business opportunities. In addition, the terms of our existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness subject us to various restrictions that may limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness subject us to various restrictions on our ability to engage in certain activities, including, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nacquire other businesses or make investments;\n\u2022\nraise additional capital;\n\u2022\nincur additional debt or create liens on our assets;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions;\n\u2022\nprepay indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nmerge, dissolve, liquidate, consolidate, or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.\nThese restrictions may limit or restrict our cash flow and our ability to pursue business opportunities or strategies that we would otherwise consider to be in our best interests.\nOur secured credit facility contains certain financial and other restrictive covenants that we may not satisfy, and that, if not satisfied, could result in the acceleration of the amounts due under our secured credit facility and the limitation of our ability to borrow additional funds in the future.\nThe agreements governing our secured credit facility subject us to various financial and other restrictive covenants with which we must comply on an ongoing or periodic basis. These include covenants pertaining to a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, covenants requiring the mandatory prepayment of amounts outstanding under the term loan and the revolver under specified circumstances, including (i) 100% of the net cash proceeds from certain dispositions to the extent not reinvested in our business within a stated period, (ii) 50% of the net cash proceeds from stated equity issuances, and (iii) 100% of the net cash proceeds from certain receipts of more than $250,000 outside the ordinary course of business, and limits on capital expenditures. If we violate any of these covenants, we may suffer a material adverse effect. Most notably, our outstanding debt under our secured credit facility could become immediately due and payable, our lenders could proceed against any collateral securing such indebtedness, and our ability to borrow additional funds in the future could be limited or terminated. Alternatively, we could be forced to refinance or renegotiate the terms and conditions of our secured credit facility, including the interest rates, financial and restrictive covenants and security requirements of the secured credit facility, on terms that may be significantly less favorable to us.\nA default under agreements governing our indebtedness could result in a default and acceleration of indebtedness under other agreements.\nCertain agreements governing our indebtedness contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement could result in a default and acceleration of our repayment obligations under other agreements. If a cross-default were to occur, we may not be able to pay our debts or borrow sufficient funds to refinance them. Even if new financing were available, it may not be available on acceptable terms. If some or all of our indebtedness is in default for any reason, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur mobile satellite products currently depend on satellite services and facilities provided by third parties, and a disruption in those services could adversely affect sales.\nOur satellite antenna products include the equipment necessary to utilize satellite services; we do not own the satellites to directly provide two-way satellite communications. We currently offer satellite television products compatible with the DIRECTV and DISH Network services in the United States, the Bell TV service in Canada, the Sky Mexico service and various other regional satellite TV services in other parts of the world.\nSES, Eutelsat, Sky Perfect-JSAT, Telesat, EchoStar, Intelsat and Star One currently provide the satellite capacity to support the mini-VSAT Broadband service and our TracPhone V-IP series products. Intelsat also currently provides our C-Band satellite coverage. In addition, we have agreements with various teleports and Internet service providers around the globe to support the mini-VSAT Broadband service. We rely on Inmarsat for satellite communications services for our FleetBroadband and FleetOne compatible TracPhone products.\nIf customers become dissatisfied with the programming, pricing, service, availability or other aspects of any of these satellite services, or if any one or more of these services becomes unavailable for any reason, we could suffer a substantial decline in sales of our satellite products. There may be no alternative service provider available in a particular geographic area, and our modem or other technology may not be compatible with the technology of any alternative service provider that may be available. In addition, the unexpected failure of a satellite could disrupt the availability of programming and services, which could reduce the demand for, or customer satisfaction with, our products.\nWe rely upon spread spectrum communications technology developed by ViaSat and transmitted by third-party satellite providers to permit two-way broadband Internet via our TracPhone V-IP series antennas, and any disruption in the availability of this technology could adversely affect sales.\nOur mini-VSAT Broadband service relies on spread spectrum technology developed by ViaSat, Inc., for use with satellite capacity controlled by SES, Eutelsat, Sky Perfect-JSAT, Telesat, Echostar, Intelsat and Star One. Our TracPhone two-way broadband satellite terminals combine our stabilized antenna technology with ViaSat\u2019s ArcLight spread spectrum mobile broadband technology, along with ViaSat\u2019s ArcLight spread spectrum modem. The ArcLight technology is also integrated within the satellite hubs that support this service. Sales of the TracPhone V-IP series products and our mini-VSAT Broadband service could be disrupted if we fail to receive approval from regulatory authorities to provide our spread spectrum service in the waters of various countries where our customers operate or if there are issues with the availability of the ArcLight maritime modems. Moreover, over the course of our ten-year agreement with ViaSat, which expires in 2018, satellite communications technology may continue to evolve, which could reduce the relative attractiveness of the technology we currently offer, and our technology may cease to be compatible with changes in satellite service offerings. If we were to seek to, or required to, transition to any new technology, we may encounter technological challenges, increased expenses, customer dissatisfaction, inventory obsolescence, interruptions in supply, disruptions in current relationships or arrangements and unforeseen obstacles, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our mobile satellite business, revenues and profitability.\nWe have single dedicated manufacturing facilities for each of our mobile communications and guidance and stabilization product categories, and any significant disruption to a facility could impair our ability to deliver our products.\nExcluding the products manufactured by Videotel, which we manufacture in the United Kingdom, we currently manufacture all of our mobile communications products at our manufacturing facility in Middletown, Rhode Island, and the majority of our guidance and stabilization products at our facility in Tinley Park, Illinois. Some of our production processes are complex, and we may be unable to respond rapidly to the loss of the use of either production facility. For example, our production facilities use some specialized equipment that may take time to replace if they are damaged or become unusable for any reason. In that event, shipments would be delayed, which could result in customer or dealer dissatisfaction, loss of sales and damage to our reputation. Finally, we have only a limited capability to increase our manufacturing capacity in the short term. If short-term demand for our products exceeds our manufacturing capacity, our inability to fulfill orders in a timely manner could also lead to customer or dealer dissatisfaction, loss of sales and damage to our reputation.\nWe depend on sole or limited source suppliers, and any disruption in supply could impair our ability to deliver our products on time or at expected cost.\nWe obtain many key components for our products from third-party suppliers, and in some cases we use a single or a limited number of suppliers. Any interruption in supply could impair our ability to deliver our products until we identify and qualify a new source of supply, which could take several weeks, months or longer and could increase our costs significantly. Suppliers might change or discontinue key components, which could require us to modify our product designs. For example, in the past, we have experienced changes in the chemicals used to coat our optical fiber, which changed its characteristics and thereby necessitated design modifications. Department of Defense regulations requiring government contractors to implement processes to avoid counterfeit parts may require us to find new sources of materials or components if the current supplier cannot meet the requirements. In general, we do not have written long-term supply agreements with our suppliers but instead purchase components through purchase orders, which expose us to potential price increases and termination of supply without notice or recourse. It is generally not our practice to carry significant inventories of product components, and this could magnify the impact of the loss of a supplier. If we are required to use a new source of materials or components, it could also result in unexpected manufacturing difficulties and could affect product performance and reliability. In addition, from time to time, lead times for certain components can increase significantly due to imbalances in overall market supply and demand. This, in turn, could limit our ability to satisfy the demand for certain of our products on a timely basis and could result in some customer orders being rescheduled or canceled.\nWe may continue to increase the use of international suppliers to source components for our manufacturing operations, which could disrupt our business.\nAlthough we have historically manufactured and sourced raw materials for the majority of our products domestically, in order for us to compete with lower priced competing products while also improving our profitability, in some instances we have found it desirable to source raw materials and manufactured components and assemblies from Europe, Asia, and South America. Reliance on foreign manufacturing and/or raw material supply has lengthened our supply chain and increased the risk that a disruption in that supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.\nAdverse economic conditions could result in financial difficulties or bankruptcy for any of our suppliers, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe significant downturn in worldwide economic conditions and credit tightening could present challenges to our suppliers, which could result in disruptions to our business, increase our costs, delay shipment of our products or delivery of services, and impair our ability to generate and recognize revenue. To address their own business challenges, our suppliers may increase prices, reduce the availability of credit, require deposits or advance payments or take other actions that may impose a burden on us.\nThey may also reduce production capacity, slow or delay delivery of products, face challenges meeting our specifications or otherwise fail to meet our requirements. In some cases, our suppliers may face bankruptcy. We may be required to identify, qualify, and engage new suppliers, which would require time and the attention of management. Any of these events could impair our ability to deliver our products and services to customers in a timely and cost-effective manner, cause us to breach our contractual commitments or result in the loss of customers.\nOur media and entertainment business relies on licensing arrangements with content providers, and the loss of or changes in those arrangements could adversely affect our business.\nWe distribute premium news, sports, movies, and music content for commercial and leisure customers in the maritime, hotel, and retail markets. We do not generate this content but instead license the content from third parties on a non-exclusive basis. We do not have long-term license agreements with any content provider. Accordingly, any content provider could terminate our existing arrangements with little or no advance notice or could adversely modify the terms of the arrangement, including potential price increases. Further, the licenses we obtain are limited in scope, and any violation of the terms of a license could expose us to liability for copyright infringement. We pay license fees that are based in part on the revenue we generate from sublicenses, and our licensors generally have the right to audit our records to determine whether we have paid all necessary license fees. Failure to pay required license fees could result in termination of our license rights, penalties, or damages. The loss of content could adversely affect the attractiveness of our media and entertainment offerings, which could adversely affect our revenues. Any increase in the cost of content could reduce the profitability of these offerings.\nAny failure to maintain and expand our third-party distribution relationships may limit our ability to penetrate markets for mobile communications products and services.\nWe market and sell our mobile communications products and services through an international network of independent retailers, chain stores and distributors, as well as to manufacturers of marine vessels, recreational vehicles and buses. If we are unable to maintain or improve our distribution relationships, it could significantly limit our sales. Some of our distribution relationships are new, and our new distributors may not be successful in marketing and selling our products and services. In addition, our distribution partners may sell products of other companies, including competing products, and are generally not required to purchase minimum quantities of our products.\nOur international business operations expose us to a number of difficulties in coordinating our activities abroad and in dealing with multiple regulatory environments.\nHistorically, sales to customers outside the United States have accounted for a significant portion of our net sales, and our acquisitions of Videotel in July 2014 and Headland Media Limited (now known as the KVH Media Group) in May 2013 increased our sales in new foreign markets. We derived 48%, 41%, and 46% of our revenues in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, from sales to customers outside the United States. We have foreign sales offices in Denmark, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, Norway, and Cyprus, as well as a subsidiary in Brazil that manages local sales. However, aside from these international sales offices, substantially all of our personnel and operations, particularly for our mobile satellite communications equipment business and our guidance and stabilization business, are located in the United States. Our limited operations in foreign countries may impair our ability to compete successfully in international markets and\nto meet the service and support needs of our customers in countries where we have little to no infrastructure. We are subject to a number of risks associated with our international business activities, which may increase our costs and require significant management attention. Our acquisitions of Videotel and Headland Media Limited (now known as KVH Media Group) have augmented these risks. These risks include:\n\u2022\ntechnical challenges we may face in adapting our mobile communications products to function with different satellite services and technology in use in various regions around the world;\n\u2022\nsatisfaction of international regulatory requirements and delays and costs associated with procurement of any necessary licenses or permits;\n\u2022\nthe potential unavailability of content licenses covering international waters and foreign locations;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the sale of certain guidance and stabilization products to foreign military and government customers;\n\u2022\nincreased costs of providing customer support in multiple languages;\n\u2022\nincreased costs of managing operations that are international in scope;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\nprotectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors, which could slow our growth in international markets;\n\u2022\npotentially longer sales cycles, which could slow our revenue growth from international sales;\n\u2022\npotentially longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; and\n\u2022\neconomic and political instability in some international markets.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause of the scope of our foreign sales and foreign operations, we face significant exposure to movements in exchange rates for foreign currencies, particularly the British pound sterling and the euro. During recent months, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against relevant foreign currencies, which decreases our revenues reported in U.S. dollars and decreases the reported value of our assets in foreign countries. However, if the U.S. dollar weakens, our revenues reported in U.S. dollars, as well as the reported value of our assets in foreign countries, would be commensurately higher. Moreover, certain of our products and services are sold internationally in U.S. dollars; as the U.S. dollar strengthens, the relative cost of these products and services to customers located in foreign countries increases, which adversely affects sales. In addition, most of our financial obligations, including payments under our outstanding debt obligations, must be satisfied in U.S. dollars. Our exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates may change over time as our business practices evolve and could result in increased costs or reduced revenue and could adversely affect our cash flow. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and may have a significant impact on our operating results. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can cost-effectively mitigate this exposure.\nWe could incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties if we do not comply with certain regulations.\nAs a result of our expanding international operations, we are subject to a number of legal requirements, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the customs, export, trade sanctions and anti-boycott laws of the United States, including those administered by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Department of Commerce, the Department of State, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Treasury Department, as well as those of other nations in which we do business. Compliance with these laws and regulations is complex and involves significant costs. These risks are heightened for acquired businesses that have historically been managed outside the United States, where these laws and regulations may not have applied to the same extent. Our assessment of compliance with these laws and regulations by businesses that we have acquired may not have uncovered instances of non-compliance, and we may face liability for such non-compliance. In addition, our training and compliance programs and our other internal control policies may be insufficient to protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents or third-party contractors. Any violation of these requirements by us or our employees, agents or third-party contractors may subject us to significant criminal and civil liability.\nExports of certain guidance and stabilization products are subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and require a license from the U.S. Department of State prior to shipment.\nWe must comply with the United States Export Administration Regulations and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR. Certain of our products have military or strategic applications and are on the munitions list of the ITAR and require an individual validated license in order to be exported to certain jurisdictions. Any changes in export regulations or\nreclassifications of our products may further restrict the export of our products, and we may cease to be able to procure export licenses for our products under existing regulations. The length of time required by the licensing process can vary, potentially delaying the shipment of products and the recognition of the corresponding revenue. Any restriction on the export of a product line or any amount of our products could cause a significant reduction in net sales.\nAcquisitions may disrupt our operations or adversely affect our results.\nWe evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities to acquire other businesses as they arise, such as our acquisitions of Videotel in July 2014 and Headland Media Limited (now known as the KVH Media Group) in May 2013. The expenses we incur evaluating and pursuing these and other such acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, during 2014, we incurred significant expenses related to the acquisition of Videotel. If we acquire a business, we may be unable to manage it profitably or successfully integrate its operations with our own. Moreover, we may be unable to realize the strategic, financial, operational and other benefits we anticipate from any acquisition, and any acquisition may increase our overall operating expenses. Competition for acquisition opportunities could increase the price we pay for businesses we acquire and could reduce the number of potential acquisition targets. Further, our approach to acquisitions may involve a number of special financial and business risks, such as:\n\u2022\nentry into new and unfamiliar lines of business or markets, which may present challenges or risks that we did not anticipate;\n\u2022\nincreased expenses associated with the amortization of acquired intangible assets;\n\u2022\nincreased exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ncharges related to any potential acquisition from which we may withdraw;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s time, attention, and resources;\n\u2022\nloss of key acquired personnel;\n\u2022\nincreased costs to improve or coordinate managerial, operational, financial, and administrative systems, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u2022\ndilutive issuances of equity securities;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of legal liabilities; and\n\u2022\nlosses arising from impairment charges associated with goodwill or intangible assets.\nFor example, we are incurring additional expenses to implement internal control over financial reporting appropriate for a public company at Videotel, which previously operated as a private company not subject to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nIf we cannot effectively manage changes in our rate of growth, our business may suffer.\nWe have previously expanded our operations to pursue existing and potential market opportunities, and we are continuing to expand our international operations. For example, we expanded our service offerings through the acquisitions of Videotel and Headland Media Limited (now known as the KVH Media Group) in 2014 and 2013, respectively. This growth has placed a strain on our personnel, management, financial and other resources and has increased our operating expenses. If any portion of our business grows more rapidly than we anticipate and we fail to manage that growth properly, we may incur unnecessary expenses, and the efficiency of our operations may decline. If we are unable to adjust our operating expenses on a timely basis in response to changes in revenue cycles, our results of operations may be harmed. To manage changes in our rate of growth effectively, we must, among other things:\n\u2022\nmatch our manufacturing facilities and capacity to demand for our products and services in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nsecure appropriate satellite capacity to match changes in demand for airtime services in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully attract, train, motivate and manage appropriate numbers of employees for manufacturing, sales, marketing and customer support activities;\n\u2022\neffectively manage our inventory and working capital;\n\u2022\nmaintain the efficiencies within our operating, administrative, financial and accounting systems; and\n\u2022\nensure that our procedures and internal controls are revised and updated to remain appropriate for the size and scale of our business operations.\nWe identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, and the occurrence of these or any other material weaknesses could have a material adverse effect on our ability to report accurate financial information in a timely manner.\nAs described in \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures,\u201d of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, our management concluded that we had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 and therefore did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or effective disclosure controls and procedures, both of which are requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of that date. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses related to guidance and stabilization contracts where revenue is recognized on a bill and hold basis, the accounting for income taxes and the accounting for multiple-element lease transactions. Following the identification of the material weaknesses in March 2015, management implemented remediation plans and successfully tested the control remediation as of December 31, 2015. On that basis, management concluded that the material weaknesses had been remediated as of December 31, 2015.\nThe remedial measures we took may not be adequate to prevent future misstatements or avoid other control deficiencies or material weaknesses. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. Because of these limitations, there can be no assurance that any system of or internal control over financial reporting will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management. As a result, it is possible that our financial statements will not comply with generally accepted accounting principles, will contain a material misstatement or will not be available on a timely basis, any of which could cause investors to lose confidence in us and lead to, among other things, unanticipated legal, accounting and other expenses, delays in filing required financial disclosures, enforcement actions by government authorities, fines, penalties, the delisting of our common stock and liabilities arising from stockholder litigation.\nWe may be unable to hire and retain the skilled personnel we need to expand our operations.\nTo meet our growth objectives, we must attract and retain highly skilled technical, operational, managerial and sales and marketing personnel. If we fail to attract and retain the necessary personnel, we may be unable to achieve our business objectives and may lose our competitive position, which could lead to a significant decline in net sales. We face significant competition for these skilled professionals from other companies, research and academic institutions, government entities and other organizations.\nOur success depends on the services of our executive officers.\nOur future success depends to a significant degree on the skills and efforts of Martin Kits van Heyningen, our co-founder, President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board. If we lost the services of Mr. Kits van Heyningen, our business and operating results could be seriously harmed. We also depend on the ability of our other executive officers to work effectively as a team. The loss of one or more of our executive officers could impair our ability to manage our business effectively.\nOur business may suffer if we cannot protect our proprietary technology.\nOur ability to compete depends significantly upon our patents, copyrights, source code, and other proprietary technology. The steps we have taken to protect our technology may be inadequate to prevent others from using what we regard as our technology to compete with us. Our patents could expire or be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights we have under our patents could provide no competitive advantages. Existing trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws offer only limited protection. Customers or others with access to our proprietary or licensed media content could copy that content without permission or otherwise violate the terms of our customer agreements, which would adversely affect our revenues and could impair our relationships with content providers. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary technology to the same extent as the laws of the United States, which could increase the likelihood of misappropriation. Furthermore, other companies could independently develop similar or superior technology without violating\nour intellectual property rights. Any misappropriation of our technology or the development of competing technology could seriously harm our competitive position, which could lead to a substantial reduction in net sales.\nIf we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights, the proceedings could be burdensome, disruptive and expensive, distract the attention of management, and there can be no assurance that we would prevail.\nAlso, we have delivered certain technical data and information to the U.S. government under procurement contracts, and it may have unlimited rights to use that technical data and information. There can be no assurance that the U.S. government will not authorize others to use that data and information to compete with us.\nClaims by others that we infringe their intellectual property rights could harm our business and financial condition.\nOur industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents, patents that may be issued in the future, or other intellectual property rights of others.\nWe do not generally conduct exhaustive patent searches to determine whether the technology used in our products infringes patents held by third parties. In addition, product development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending, many of which are confidential when filed, with regard to similar technologies.\nFrom time to time we have faced claims by third parties that our products or technology infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights, and we may face similar claims in the future. As noted in \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings,\" Advanced Media Networks, L.L.C., or AMN, filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island against us for allegedly infringing two of its patents, seeking unspecified monetary damage and other relief. We settled this claim in January 2016 with a payment of cash to AMN. Any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against or settling the claim, even if the claim is invalid, and could distract the attention of our management. If any of our products are found to violate third-party proprietary rights, we may be required to pay substantial damages. In addition, we may be required to re-engineer our products or obtain licenses from third parties to continue to offer our products. Any efforts to re-engineer our products or obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms may not be successful, which would prevent us from selling our products, and, in any case, could substantially increase our costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCybersecurity breaches could disrupt our operations, expose us to liability, damage our reputation, and require us to incur significant costs or otherwise adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to securely process, transmit and store electronic information, including personal information of our customers. We also retain sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, personally identifiable information, credit card information, and usage data of our employees and customers on our computer networks. Although we take certain protective measures and endeavor to modify them as we believe circumstances warrant, invasive technologies and techniques continue to evolve rapidly, and our computer systems, software and networks are vulnerable to disruption, shutdown, unauthorized access, misuse, erasure, alteration, employee error, phishing, computer viruses or other malicious code, and other events that could have a security impact. Any security breach may compromise information stored on our networks and may result in significant data losses or theft of our, our customers', our business partners' or our employees' sensitive information. We may be required to expend substantial additional resources to augment our efforts to address potential cybersecurity risks, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf any of these events were to occur, they could disrupt our operations, distract our management, cause us to lose existing customers and fail to attract new customers, as well as subject us to regulatory actions, litigation, fines, damage to our reputation or competitive position, or orders or decrees requiring us to modify our business practices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, this could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nOur media business may expose us to claims regarding our media content.\nOur media business produces training films and eLearning computer-based training courses, including programs on safety, maintenance, security and regulatory compliance, and also provides commercially licensed maritime charting and navigation information. Our efforts to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the content we provide could be inadequate, and we could face claims of liability based on this content. Contractual and other measures we take to limit our liability may be inadequate to protect us from these claims. Although we have certain rights of indemnification from third parties for certain portions of the content we provide to customers, it may be time-consuming and expensive to enforce our rights, and the third parties may lack the resources to fulfill their obligations to us. Further, our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limitations of coverage, and there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage would be available to satisfy any claims against us. Any such claims may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFluctuations in our quarterly net sales and results of operations could depress the market price of our common stock.\nWe have at times experienced significant fluctuations in our net sales and results of operations from one quarter to the next. Our future net sales and results of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. Accordingly, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of future performance. It is possible that our net sales or results of operations in a quarter will fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If this occurs, the market price of our common stock could fall significantly. Our results of operations in any quarter can fluctuate for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in demand for our mobile communications products and services and guidance and stabilization products and services;\n\u2022\nthe timing and size of individual orders from military customers;\n\u2022\nthe mix of products and services we sell, including the mix of fixed rate and metered contracts for airtime services;\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture, test and deliver products in a timely and cost-effective manner, including the availability and timely delivery of components and subassemblies from our suppliers;\n\u2022\nour success in winning competitions for orders;\n\u2022\nthe timing of new product introductions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nexpenses incurred in pursuing acquisitions;\n\u2022\nexpenses incurred in expanding our mini-VSAT Broadband network;\n\u2022\nmarket and competitive pricing pressures;\n\u2022\nunanticipated charges or expenses, such as increases in warranty claims;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic climate; and\n\u2022\nseasonality of pleasure boat and recreational vehicle usage.\nEffective October 1, 2015, we introduced new rate plans for our airtime services, including various rate plans that offer higher data speeds with usage caps. Under our new rate plans, customers receive a base level of service for a fixed fee and pay additional fees for usage over the base level. Accordingly, the revenue we generate from a customer may vary with that customer's usage. We are unable to predict accurately the extent to which customers will transition to particular metered rate plans or the degree to which usage, and therefore our revenue, may vary from quarter to quarter.\nA large portion of our expenses, including expenses for network infrastructure, facilities, equipment, and personnel, are relatively fixed. Accordingly, if our net sales decline or do not grow as much or as quickly as we anticipate, we might be unable to maintain or improve our operating margins. Any failure to achieve anticipated net sales could therefore significantly harm our operating results for a particular fiscal period.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile.\nOur stock price has historically been volatile. During the period from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2015, the trading price of our common stock ranged from $8.83 to $15.79. Many factors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, including:\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanging needs of military customers;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimates of our performance or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nthe hiring or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nacquisitions or strategic alliances involving us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in our industries; and\n\u2022\nthe global macroeconomic and geopolitical environment.\nIn addition, the stock market can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations. Major stock market indices experienced dramatic declines in 2008, in the first quarter of 2009 and in January 2016. These fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. When the market price of a company\u2019s stock drops significantly, stockholders often institute securities litigation against that company. Any such litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses defending against the claim, divert the time and attention of our management and result in significant damages.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities, which could negatively impact our income tax expense, net income and cash flow.\nWe are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities requires judgment and estimation. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities and to the prospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our income tax benefit or expense, net loss or income, and cash flows in the period in which such determination is made. As of December 31, 2015, we had liabilities for uncertain tax positions of $1.5 million, the majority of which relates to uncertain tax positions held on Videotel\u2019s balance sheet as of the acquisition date.\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. A valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value, which assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the net carrying value. We review our deferred tax assets and valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. As part of our review, we consider positive and negative evidence, including cumulative results in recent years.\nIf, during our quarterly reviews of our deferred tax assets, we determine that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the net carrying value of our deferred tax assets, we will record a valuation allowance to reduce the tax assets to estimated realizable value. This could result in a material income tax charge.\nChanges in the competitive environment or supply chain issues may require inventory write-downs.\nFrom time to time, we have recorded significant inventory reserves and/or inventory write-offs as a result of substantial declines in customer demand. Market or competitive changes could lead to future charges for excess or obsolete inventory, especially if we are unable to appropriately adjust the supply of material from our vendors.\nIf goodwill or other intangible assets that we have recorded in connection with our acquisitions of other businesses become impaired, we could have to take significant charges against earnings.\nAs a result of our acquisitions, we have recorded, and may continue to record, a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets. Under current accounting guidelines, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired. Any reduction or impairment of the value of goodwill or other intangible assets will result in additional charges against earnings, which could materially reduce our reported results of operations in future periods.\nCompliance with conflict minerals disclosure rules may further increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to the SEC's disclosure requirements for public companies that manufacture, or contract to manufacture, products for which certain minerals and their derivatives, namely tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d are necessary to the functionality or production of those products. These regulations require us to determine which of our products contain conflict minerals and, if so, to perform an extensive inquiry into our supply chain in an effort to determine whether or not such conflict minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo, or DRC, or an adjoining country. The European Union is considering the adoption of conflict minerals disclosure requirements, which may apply to us and may be more extensive than those adopted by the SEC. We may incur increased costs to comply with these disclosure\nrequirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Because our supply chain is complex, the country of origin inquiry and due diligence procedures that we implement may not enable us to ascertain the origins of any conflict minerals that we use or determine that these minerals did not originate from the DRC or an adjoining country, which may harm our reputation with customers, investors, non-governmental organizations or others and lead to a decline in our stock price. In the conflict minerals report that we filed in 2015, we concluded that the origins of the relevant conflict minerals we used in 2014 were \u201cDRC conflict undeterminable,\u201d as a result of which we were not required to obtain an independent private sector audit of our conflict minerals report. The temporary rules permitting issuers to report that the origins of the conflict minerals they use are \u201cDRC conflict undeterminable\u201d have expired; however, as a result of pending litigation, the requirement to obtain an independent private sector audit is subject to a temporary stay unless an issuer wishes to report that its products are \"DRC conflict-free.\" It is possible that the stay could be lifted, in which case we expect that the expenses of preparing our conflict minerals report and obtaining any necessary private sector audit will increase. We may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as DRC conflict-free, which could harm our relationships with these customers and lead to a loss of revenue. These requirements could also have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source these minerals, and we may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at competitive prices, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability.\nOur charter and by-laws and Delaware law may deter takeovers.\nOur certificate of incorporation, by-laws and Delaware law contain provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect and discourage, delay or prevent a change in control or an acquisition that many stockholders may find attractive. These provisions may also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to take some corporate actions, including the election of directors. These provisions relate to:\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock, and determine its terms, without a stockholder vote;\n\u2022\nthe classification of our Board of Directors, which effectively prevents stockholders from electing a majority of the directors at any one annual meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe limitation that directors may be removed only for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote;\n\u2022\nthe prohibition against stockholder actions by written consent;\n\u2022\nthe inability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations.", "PERMNO": 83390, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "KVHI"}
