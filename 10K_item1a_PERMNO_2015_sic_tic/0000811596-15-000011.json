{"cik": "811596", "company": "KAISER ALUMINUM CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis Item may contain statements which constitute \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for cautionary information with respect to such forward-looking statements. Such cautionary information should be read as applying to all forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this Report. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary from those in forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors including those we discuss in this Item and elsewhere in this Report. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the risks described below are those that we believe are material to our company. The occurrence of any of the events discussed below could significantly and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial position, results of operations and cash flows as well as the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have experienced and continue to experience the effects of global economic uncertainty.\nThe global economy continues to experience a period of uncertainty with wide-ranging effects, including:\n\u2022\ndisruption in global financial markets that has at times reduced the liquidity available to us, our customers, our suppliers and the purchasers of products that materially affect demand for our products, including commercial airlines;\n\u2022\na weakened global banking and financial system that creates ongoing risk and exposure to the impact of non-performance by banks committed to provide financing, hedging counterparties, insurers, customers and suppliers;\n\u2022\nvolatility in commodity prices that can materially impact the results of our hedging strategies, create near-term cash margin requirements, reduce the value of our inventories and borrowing base under our revolving credit facility and potentially result in substantial non-cash charges as we adjust inventory values and mark-to-market our hedge positions;\n\u2022\nour inability to achieve the level of growth, integration or other benefits anticipated from our strategic investments;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our costs, including the cost of energy, raw materials and freight, which we may not be able to pass entirely through to our customers;\n\u2022\nsubstantial fluctuations in consumer spending that have at times reduced the demand for some applications that use our products;\n\u2022\ndestocking and restocking of inventory levels throughout the supply chain for certain of our products;\n\u2022\npressure to reduce defense spending, which reductions could affect demand for our products used in defense applications, as the U.S. and foreign governments are faced with competing national priorities;\n\u2022\nthe inability to predict with any certainty the success or failure of efforts to reduce government deficit spending or the scope, nature or effect of such efforts; and\n\u2022\nrapidly falling oil prices, which could impact the demand of our products, especially in aerospace/high strength and automotive applications.\nWe are unable to predict the impact, severity and duration of these effects, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe fabricated products segment of the aluminum industry is highly competitive. Competition in the sale of fabricated aluminum products is based upon quality, availability, price, service and delivery performance. Many of our competitors are substantially larger than we are and have greater financial resources than we do and may have other strategic advantages, including more efficient technologies or lower or more stable raw material costs. Our facilities are located in North America. To the extent that our competitors have or develop production facilities located outside North America, they may be able to produce similar products at a lower cost or sell those products at a lower price either during periods when the currency exchange rates favor foreign competition or through a process of dumping those products in violation of existing trade laws. We may not be able to adequately reduce our costs or prices to compete with these products. Increased competition could cause a reduction in our shipment volumes and product pricing or increase our expenditures, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on a core group of significant customers.\nIn 2014, our largest fabricated products customers, Reliance and Boeing, accounted for approximately 22% and 10%, respectively, of our net sales in 2014 and our five largest customers in total accounted for approximately 47% of our fabricated products net sales. If our existing relationships with significant customers materially deteriorate or are terminated and we are not successful in replacing lost business, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, a prolonged or increasing downturn in the business or financial position of any of our significant customers could cause any one or more of them to limit purchases to contractual minimum volumes, seek relief from contractual minimums or breach those obligations, all of which could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur industry is very sensitive to foreign economic, regulatory and political factors that may adversely affect our business.\nWe import primary aluminum from and manufacture fabricated products used in, foreign countries. Factors in the politically and economically diverse countries in which we operate or have customers or suppliers, including inflation, fluctuations in currency and interest rates, availability of financial capital, competitive factors, civil unrest and labor problems, could affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could also be adversely affected by:\n\u2022\nacts of war or terrorism or the threat of war or terrorism;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulation in the countries in which we operate, service customers or purchase raw materials;\n\u2022\nthe implementation of controls on imports, exports or prices;\n\u2022\nthe adoption of new forms of taxation and duties;\n\u2022\nnew forms of emission controls and tax, commonly known as \u201ccap and trade\u201d;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of currency restrictions;\n\u2022\nthe nationalization or appropriation of rights or other assets; and\n\u2022\ntrade disputes involving countries in which we operate, service customers or purchase raw materials.\nThe commercial aerospace industry is cyclical and downturns in the commercial aerospace industry, including downturns resulting from acts of terrorism, could adversely affect our business.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from products sold to the aerospace industry, which is highly cyclical. The aerospace industry is historically driven by the demand for new commercial aircraft. Demand for commercial aircraft is influenced by trends in airline passenger traffic and increasing global travel, normal replacement of older aircraft, replacement\nof fuel inefficient aircraft, airline industry profitability, the state of the U.S. and global economies, the effects of terrorism, the effects of concerns regarding pandemics of infectious disease and numerous other factors, including safety concerns with newly introduced aircraft, any of which could result in a sharp decrease globally in new commercial aircraft deliveries and order cancellations or deferrals by the major airlines. Despite existing backlogs, financial uncertainty in the industry, inadequate liquidity of certain airline companies, terrorist acts or the increased threat of terrorism may lead to reduced demand for new aircraft that utilize our products, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nReductions in defense spending for aerospace and non-aerospace military applications could substantially reduce demand for our products.\nOur products are used in a wide variety of military applications, including military jets, armored vehicles and ordnance. The funding of U.S. government programs is subject to congressional appropriations. Many of the programs in which we participate may extend several years; however, these programs are normally funded annually. Changes in military strategy and priorities may affect current and future programs. With significant pressure to reduce defense spending as the U.S. and foreign governments are faced with competing national priorities, reductions in defense spending could reduce the demand for our products and could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur customers may reduce their demand for aluminum products in favor of alternative materials.\nOur fabricated aluminum products compete with products made from other materials, such as steel, titanium and composites, for various applications. For instance, the commercial aerospace industry has used and continues to evaluate the further use of alternative materials to aluminum, such as titanium and composites, in order to reduce the weight and increase the fuel efficiency of aircraft. Additionally, the automotive industry, while motivated to reduce vehicle weight with the use of aluminum, may revert to steel for certain applications. The willingness of customers to accept other materials in lieu of aluminum could adversely affect the demand for our products, particularly our Aero/HS products and Automotive Extrusions and thus adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nDownturns in the automotive and ground transportation industries could adversely affect our business.\nThe demand for our Automotive Extrusions and many of our general engineering and other industrial products is dependent on the production of cars, light trucks, SUVs and heavy duty vehicles and trailers in North America. The automotive industry is highly cyclical, as new vehicle demand is dependent on consumer spending and is tied closely to the overall strength of the North American economy. Weak demand for, or lower production of, new cars, light trucks, SUVs and heavy duty vehicles and trailers, particularly by U.S. manufacturers, could adversely affect the demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in consumer demand for particular motor vehicles could adversely affect our business.\nSensitivity to fuel prices and consumer preferences can influence consumer demand for motor vehicles that have a higher content of the aluminum Automotive Extrusions that we supply. The loss of business with respect to, or a lack of commercial success of, one or more particular vehicle models for which we are a significant supplier could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face pressure from our customers on pricing.\nCost cutting initiatives that many of our customers have adopted generally result in downward pressure on pricing. If we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nReductions in demand for our products may be more severe than and may occur prior to reductions in demand for, our customers\u2019 products.\nCustomers purchasing our fabricated aluminum products, especially those in the cyclical aerospace industry, generally require significant lead time in the production of their own products. Therefore, demand for our products may increase prior to demand for our customers\u2019 products. Conversely, demand for our products may decrease as our customers anticipate a downturn in their respective businesses. As demand for our customers\u2019 products begins to soften, our customers typically meet the reduced demand for their products using their own inventory without replenishing that inventory, which results in a reduction in demand for our products that is greater than the reduction in demand for their products. Further, the reduction in demand for our products can be exacerbated if inventory levels at our customers exceed normal levels, due to production delays of specific commercial airframe models, prior purchases by our customers of our products under sales contracts at committed volumes that exceed the actual needs of our customers, or for other reasons. This amplified reduction in demand for our\nproducts while our customers consume their inventory to meet their business needs (destocking) may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is subject to unplanned business interruptions which may adversely affect our business.\nThe production of fabricated aluminum products and aluminum is subject to unplanned events such as explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, accidents, labor disruptions, transportation interruptions and supply interruptions. Operational interruptions at one or more of our production facilities, particularly interruptions at our Trentwood facility where our production of plate and sheet is concentrated, could cause substantial losses in our production capacity. Furthermore, because customers may be dependent on planned deliveries from us, customers that have to reschedule their own production due to our delivery delays may be able to pursue financial claims against us and we may incur costs to correct such problems in addition to any liability resulting from such claims. Interruptions may also harm our reputation among actual and potential customers, potentially resulting in a loss of business. To the extent these losses are not covered by insurance, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected by such events.\nCovenants and events of default in our debt instruments could limit our ability to undertake certain types of transactions and adversely affect our liquidity.\nOur revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our $225.0 million of 8.250% Senior Notes due 2020 (\"Senior Notes\") contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock;\n\u2022prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities;\n\u2022make loans and investments;\n\u2022sell assets;\n\u2022incur liens;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022alter the businesses we conduct;\n\u2022enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends; and\n\u2022consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition, restrictive covenants in our revolving credit facility require us in certain circumstances to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control and we may be unable to meet them.\nA breach of the covenants or restrictions under the indenture governing the Senior Notes or under our revolving credit facility could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt. A payment default or an acceleration following an event of default under our revolving credit facility, our indenture for our Senior Notes, or our indenture for our 4.5% Cash Convertible Senior Notes due April 1, 2015 (\"Convertible Notes\") could trigger an event of default under the other two indebtedness obligations as well as any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, which could result in the principal of and the accrued and unpaid interest on all such debt becoming due and payable. In addition, an event of default under our revolving credit facility could permit the lenders under our revolving credit facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay any amounts due and payable under our revolving credit facility, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022limited in how we conduct our business and grow in accordance with our strategy;\n\u2022unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u2022unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nIn addition, our financial results, our level of indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of any additional or replacement financing.\nYou should read our more detailed descriptions of our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our Senior Notes in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the documents themselves, for further information about these covenants.\nRestrictive covenants in our debt instruments contain significant qualifications and exceptions.\nWhile our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the Senior Notes place limitations on our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions, repurchase or redeem capital stock and make loans and investments, investors should be aware that these limitations are subject to significant qualifications and exceptions. The aggregate amount of payments made in compliance with these limitations could be substantial.\nAs suggested above, you should read our more detailed descriptions of our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our Senior Notes in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the documents themselves, for further information about these covenants.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our debt obligations, including the Senior Notes and our Convertible Notes, depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any and interest on our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes and Convertible Notes.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes and Convertible Notes. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the Senior Notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or certain forms of equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate asset dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of the Senior Notes and Convertible Notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under our revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to loan money, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nThe holders of the Convertible Notes and our counterparties under the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions that we entered into in connection with the issuance of our Convertible Notes may affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn connection with the issuance of our Convertible Notes, we entered into privately negotiated transactions whereby we purchased cash-settled call options (\"Option Assets\") relating to shares of our common stock and sold to the same option counterparties net-share-settled warrants relating to our common stock. The final settlement period for the Convertible Notes and the Option Assets began on January 15, 2015 and continues for 50 consecutive trading days, ending on March 27, 2015. The 120 consecutive trading day settlement period for the net-share-settled warrants commences on July 1, 2015.\nWe understand that the option counterparties and/or their affiliates and holders of some of our Convertible Notes have entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock in order to hedge their exposure to fluctuations and volatility in the price of our common stock and that they may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of our Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so during the settlement averaging period related to a conversion of our Convertible Notes). These transactions and activities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the Option Assets purchased to hedge our Convertible Notes.\nThe Option Assets purchased in connection with the issuance of our Convertible Notes are intended to hedge amounts payable upon the conversion of the Convertible Notes, less the principal amount thereon. The counterparties for the Option Assets are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions and we are subject to the risk that these counterparties may default or otherwise fail to perform, or may exercise certain rights to terminate their obligations, under the Option Assets transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of these counterparties is not secured by any collateral. If one or more of these counterparties becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. The size of our exposure is determined by the difference between the market price of our common stock and the exercise price of the Option Assets during the final settlement period, which began on January 15, 2015 and continues for 50 consecutive trading days, ending on March 27, 2015. While the Option Assets will settle within approximately six weeks from the date of this Report and the counterparties currently appear to be solvent, we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the counterparties. A default or other failure to perform, or a termination of obligations, by one of the counterparties could materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for cash to meet our obligations and pay any dividends.\nWe are a holding company and conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries, certain of which are not guarantors of our Senior Notes or our other indebtedness. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes, is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of the Senior Notes or other indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on the Senior Notes or other indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. While our revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the Senior Notes limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our productivity enhancement and cost reduction initiatives.\nAs the economy and markets for our products move through economic downturns or supply otherwise begins to exceed demand through increases in capacity or reduced demand, it is increasingly important for us to be a low cost producer. Although we have undertaken and expect to continue to undertake productivity enhancement and cost reduction initiatives to improve performance, including deployment of company-wide business improvement methodologies, such as our Kaiser Production System, which involves the integrated application of continuous improvement tools such as Lean Manufacturing, Six Sigma and Total Productive Manufacturing, we cannot assure you that all of these initiatives will be completed or beneficial to us or that any estimated cost saving from such activities will be fully realized. Even when we are able to generate new efficiencies successfully in the short- to medium-term, we may not be able to continue to reduce cost and increase productivity over the long term.\nOur business could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of aluminum.\nThe price of primary aluminum has historically been subject to significant cyclical price fluctuations and the timing of changes in the market price of aluminum is largely unpredictable. Although our pricing of fabricated aluminum products is generally intended to pass the risk of price fluctuations on to our customers, we may not be able to pass on the entire cost of increases to our customers and there can be a potential time lag between increases in costs for aluminum and the point when we can implement a corresponding increase in price to our customers. As a result, we may be exposed to fluctuations in the costs for aluminum since, during the time lag, we may have to bear the additional cost increase. If these events were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, increases in aluminum costs may cause some of our customers to substitute other materials for our products over time, adversely affecting our financial position, results of operations and cash flows due to a decrease in the sales of fabricated aluminum products.\nLegislation on derivative transactions could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business and on the cost of our hedging activities.\nWe use over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives products to hedge our risks relating to primary aluminum prices, energy prices and foreign currency. Recent legislation has been adopted to increase the regulatory oversight of the OTC derivatives markets and impose restrictions on certain derivative transactions, which could affect the use of derivatives in hedging transactions. If regulations subject us to additional capital or margin requirements or other restrictions on our trading and commodity positions, they could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business or on the cost of our hedging activities.\nOur hedging programs may limit the income and cash flows we would otherwise expect to receive if our hedging program were not in place and may otherwise affect our business.\nFrom time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into hedging transactions to limit our exposure to price risks relating to primary aluminum prices, energy prices and foreign currency. To the extent that market prices or exchange rates at the expiration of these hedging transactions would have been more favorable to us than the fixed prices or rates established by these hedging transactions, our income and cash flows will be lower than they otherwise would have been. Additionally, to the extent that primary aluminum prices, energy prices or foreign currency exchange rates deviate materially and adversely from fixed, floor or ceiling prices or rates established by outstanding hedging transactions, we fail to satisfy certain covenants, or an event of default occurs under the terms of the underlying documents, we could incur margin calls that could adversely impact our liquidity and result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Conversely, we are exposed to risks associated with the credit worthiness of our hedging counterparties. The credit worthiness of hedging counterparties is inherently difficult to assess and can change quickly and dramatically. Non-performance by a counterparty could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations could adversely affect our business.\nA significant number of our employees are represented by labor unions under labor contracts with varying durations and expiration dates, including labor contracts with the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, AFL-CIO, CLC (\u201cUSW\u201d), covering seven of our manufacturing locations. Employees represented by labor unions under labor contracts represented approximately 63% of our employees at December 31, 2014. In January 2015, we were successful in renegotiating the terms of a labor contract with the USW covering employees at our manufacturing locations in Newark, Ohio and Trentwood and extending the term of such contract through September 2020. Contracts at seven other manufacturing locations expire in 2015 through 2017. We may not be able to renegotiate or negotiate these or our other labor contracts on satisfactory terms. As part of any negotiation, we may reach agreements with respect to future wages and benefits that could materially and adversely affect our future financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, negotiations could divert management attention or result in union-initiated work actions, including strikes or work stoppages, that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, the existence of labor agreements may not prevent such union-initiated work actions.\nOur participation in multi-employer union pension plans may have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nWe are required to make contributions to multi-employer pension plans in amounts established under collective bargaining agreements. Pension expense for these plans is recognized as contributions are funded. Benefits generally are based on a fixed amount for each year of service. Based on the most recent information available to us, we believe a number of these multiemployer plans are underfunded. As a result, we expect that contributions to these plans may increase. Additionally, the benefit levels and related items will be issues in the negotiation of our collective bargaining agreements. Under current law, an employer that withdraws or partially withdraws from a multi-employer pension plan may incur withdrawal liability to the plan, which represents the portion of the plan\u2019s underfunding that is allocable to the withdrawing employer under very complex actuarial and allocation rules. The failure of a withdrawing employer to fund these obligations can impact remaining employers. The amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multi-employer pension plans will depend upon the outcome of collective bargaining, actions taken by trustees who manage the plans and other employers who participate in the plans, government regulations and the actual return on assets held in the plans, among other factors.\nEnvironmental compliance, clean up and damage claims may decrease our cash flow and adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations with respect to, among other things: air and water emissions and discharges; the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste; and the release of hazardous or toxic substances, pollutants and contaminants into the environment. Compliance with these environmental laws is and will continue to be costly.\nOur continuing operations and certain of our former operations have subjected and may in the future subject us to fines, penalties and expenses for alleged breaches of environmental laws and to obligations to perform investigations or clean up of the environment. We may also be subject to claims from governmental authorities or third parties related to alleged injuries to\nthe environment, human health or natural resources, including claims with respect to waste disposal sites, the clean up of sites currently or formerly used by us or exposure of individuals to hazardous materials. Any investigation, clean-up or other remediation costs, fines or penalties, or costs to resolve third-party claims, may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have accrued and will accrue for costs relating to the above matters that are reasonably expected to be incurred based on available information. However, it is possible that actual costs may differ, perhaps significantly, from the amounts expected or accrued. Similarly, the timing of those expenditures may occur faster than anticipated. In addition, new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations may be enacted, including government mandated green initiatives and limitations on carbon emissions, that increase the cost or complexity of compliance. Difference in actual costs, the timing of payments for previously accrued costs and the impact of new or amended laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nGovernmental regulation relating to greenhouse gas emissions may subject us to significant new costs and restrictions on our operations.\nLaws enacted by Congress, state governments or policies of the Environmental Protection Agency could regulate greenhouse gas emissions through a cap-and-trade system under which emitters would be required to buy allowances to offset emissions of greenhouse gas. In addition, several states, including states where we have manufacturing plants, are considering various greenhouse gas registration and reduction programs. Certain of our manufacturing plants use significant amounts of energy, including electricity and natural gas and certain of our plants emit amounts of greenhouse gas above certain minimum thresholds that are likely to be imposed by existing proposals. Greenhouse gas regulation could increase the price of the electricity we purchase, increase costs for our use of natural gas, potentially restrict access to or the use of natural gas, require us to purchase allowances to offset our own emissions or result in an overall increase in our costs of raw materials, any one of which could significantly increase our costs, reduce our competitiveness in a global economy or otherwise negatively affect our business, operations or financial results. It is too early to predict how existing or future regulation will affect our business, operations or financial results.\nOur investment and other expansion projects may not be completed or start up as scheduled.\nOur ability to complete our investment and expansion projects and the timing and costs of doing so, are subject to various risks associated with all major construction projects, many of which are beyond our control, including technical or mechanical problems, economic conditions and permitting. Additionally, the start up of operations after such projects have been completed can be complicated and costly. If we are unable to fully complete these projects, if the actual costs for these projects exceed our expectations, or if the start up phase after completion is more complicated than anticipated, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to risks relating to our information technology systems.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information and manage and operate our business. A breach in cyber security could expose us and our customers and suppliers to risks of misuse of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, production downtimes and operations disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, business or results of operations. The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means.\nIn addition, from time to time we may replace and/or upgrade our current information technology systems. These activities subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with replacing and updating these systems, including potential disruption of our internal control structure, substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and other risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems or of integrating new systems into our current systems. Our systems implementations and upgrades may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated, or at all. In addition, the implementation of new technology systems may cause disruptions in our business operations. Such disruption and any other information technology system disruptions and our ability to mitigate those disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may not be able to utilize all of our net operating loss carryforwards.\nWe have net operating loss carryforwards and other significant U.S. tax attributes that we believe could offset otherwise taxable income in the United States. The net operating loss carryforwards available in any year to offset our net taxable income will be reduced following a more than 50% change in ownership during any period of 36 consecutive months (an \u201cownership change\u201d) as determined under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the \u201cCode\u201d). To mitigate the risk of an ownership change occurring, through July 2016, our certificate of incorporation prohibits and voids certain transfers of our common stock in order\nto reduce the risk that an ownership change will jeopardize our net operating loss carryforwards. Because U.S. tax law limits the time during which carryforwards may be applied against future taxes, we may not be able to take full advantage of the carryforwards for federal income tax purposes. In addition, federal and state tax laws pertaining to net operating loss carryforwards may be changed from time to time such that the net operating loss carryforwards may be reduced or eliminated. If the net operating loss carryforwards become unavailable to us or are fully utilized, our future income will not be shielded from federal and state income taxation and the funds otherwise available for general corporate purposes would be reduced.\nWe could engage in or approve transactions involving our common shares that inadvertently impair the use of our federal income tax attributes.\nSection 382 of the Code affects our ability to use our federal income tax attributes, including our net operating loss carryforwards, following a more than 50% change in ownership during any period of 36 consecutive months, an ownership change, as determined under the Code. Certain transactions may be included in the calculation of an ownership change, including transactions involving our repurchase or issuance of our common shares. When we engage in or approve any transaction involving our common shares that may be included in the calculation of an ownership change, our practice is to first perform the calculations necessary to confirm that our ability to use our federal income tax attributes will not be affected. These calculations are complex and reflect certain necessary assumptions. Accordingly, it is possible that we could approve or engage in a transaction involving our common shares that causes an ownership change and inadvertently impairs the use of our federal income tax attributes.\nTransfer restrictions and other factors could hinder the market for our common stock.\nIn order to reduce the risk that an ownership change would jeopardize the preservation of our U.S. federal income tax attributes, including net operating loss carryforwards, for purposes of Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, our certificate of incorporation includes restrictions through July 2016 on transfers involving 5% ownership. These transfer restrictions may make our stock less attractive to large institutional holders, discourage potential acquirers from attempting to take over our company, limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and otherwise hinder the market for our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation includes transfer restrictions that may void transactions in our common stock effected by 5% stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation restricts the transfer of our equity securities if either (1) the transferor holds 5% or more of the fair market value of all of our issued and outstanding equity securities or (2) as a result of the transfer, either any person would become such a 5% stockholder or the percentage stock ownership of any such 5% stockholder would be increased. These restrictions are subject to exceptions set forth in our certificate of incorporation and terminate in July 2016. Any transfer that violates these restrictions is void and will be unwound as provided in our certificate of incorporation.\nWe could engage in or approve transactions involving our common shares that adversely affect significant stockholders.\nUnder the transfer restrictions in our certificate of incorporation that extend through July 2016, our 5% stockholders are, in effect, required to seek the approval of, or a determination by, our Board of Directors before they engage in transactions involving our common stock. We could engage in or approve transactions involving our common stock that limit our ability to approve future transactions involving our common stock by our 5% stockholders in accordance with the transfer restrictions in our certificate of incorporation without impairing the use of our federal income tax attributes. In addition, we could engage in or approve transactions involving our common stock that cause stockholders owning less than 5% to become 5% stockholders, resulting in those stockholders\u2019 having to seek the approval of, or a determination by, our Board of Directors under our certificate of incorporation before they could engage in future transactions involving our common stock. For example, share repurchases reduce the number of our common shares outstanding and could cause a stockholder holding less than 5% to become a 5% stockholder even though it has not acquired any additional shares.\nThe ownership of our stock is concentrated, with a few owners who may, individually or collectively, exert significant influence over us.\nCertain investment funds, advisers and organizations own greater than 5% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2014. As a result, any of them could have significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the composition of our Board of Directors. Further, to the extent that the substantial stockholders were to act in concert, they could potentially control any action taken by our stockholders. This concentration of ownership could also facilitate or hinder proxy contests, tender offers, open market purchase programs, mergers or other purchases of our common stock that might otherwise give stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of our common stock or cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We cannot assure you that the interests of our major stockholders will not conflict with our interests or the interests of our other investors.\nPayment of dividends may not continue in the future and our payment of dividends and stock repurchases are subject to restriction.\nOur Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend for each quarter since the summer of 2007. In addition, our Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program. The future declaration and payment of dividends and the ongoing purchase of our shares, if any, will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on a number of factors, including our financial and operating results, financial position and anticipated cash requirements. We can give no assurance that dividends will be declared and paid or that dividends will not be reduced in the future. Additionally, our revolving credit facility and the indenture for our Senior Notes impose limitations on our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common shares.\nOur annual variable payment obligations to two voluntary employees beneficiary associations (\"VEBAs\") are linked with our profitability, which means that not all of our earnings will be available to our stockholders.\nWe are obligated to make annual payments to two VEBAs calculated in part on our profitability. Our obligation to the VEBA that provides benefits for eligible retirees represented by certain unions and their surviving spouse and eligible dependents terminates on September 30, 2017 and is capped at $17.1 million per year. Our obligation to the VEBA that provides benefits for certain other eligible retirees, their surviving spouse and eligible dependents has no express termination date and is capped at $2.9 million per year. As a result of these variable payment obligations, our cash flows may be reduced and not all of our earnings will be available to our stockholders.\nThe USW has director nomination rights through which it may influence us and USW interests may not align with our interests or the interests of our stockholders, debt holders and other stakeholders.\nPursuant to agreements between us and the USW, the USW has the right to nominate candidates which, if elected, would constitute 40% of our Board of Directors through December 31, 2020, at which time the USW is required to cause any director nominated by the USW to submit his or her resignation to our Board of Directors, which submission our Board of Directors may accept or reject in its discretion. As a result, the directors nominated by the USW have a significant voice in the decisions of our Board of Directors. It is possible that the USW may seek to extend the term of the agreement and its right to nominate board members beyond 2020.\nDelaware law and our governing documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nProvisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage a change of control of our company or deter tender offers for our common stock. We are currently subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law. These anti-takeover provisions impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. Additionally, provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements, which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions. For example, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to determine the rights, preferences and privileges and restrictions of unissued shares of preferred stock without any vote or action by our stockholders. As a result, our Board of Directors can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of common stock. Our certificate of incorporation also divides our Board of Directors into three classes of directors who serve for staggered terms. A significant effect of a classified Board of Directors may be to deter hostile takeover attempts because an acquirer could experience delays in replacing a majority of directors. Moreover, stockholders are not permitted to call a special meeting. Through July 2016, our certificate of incorporation restricts certain transactions in our common stock involving 5% stockholders or parties who would become 5% stockholders as a result of the transaction. The general effect of these transfer restrictions, which were put in place to reduce the risk that an ownership change would jeopardize the preservation of our U.S. federal income tax attributes, including net operating loss carryforwards, is to ensure that a change in ownership of more than\n45% of our outstanding common stock cannot occur in any three-year period without the consent of our Board of Directors. These rights and provisions may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company and may limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nIn addition to the risks discussed above, as a publicly traded U.S. manufacturing company with customers and suppliers outside the United States, we are subject to a variety of other risks.\nIn addition to the risks discussed above, as a publicly traded U.S. manufacturing company with customers and suppliers outside the United States we are subject to a variety of other risks, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, or the price of our comment stock. These risks include, among others, those associated with:\n\u2022\nThe volatility of costs of fuel, principally natural gas and utility services, principally electricity, used by production facilities;\n\u2022\nChanges in economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, in the countries in which operations exists, customers are serviced or raw materials are purchased;\n\u2022\nThe ability to attract and retain key management and other personnel and develop effective succession plans;\n\u2022\nCompliance with a wide variety of health and safety laws and regulations and changes to such laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nDisputes, legal proceedings, or investigations, whether meritorious or not, with respect to a variety of matters, including matters related to personal injury, employees, taxes, contracts and product liability;\n\u2022\nPursuing growth through acquisitions, including the ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates, finance and consummate acquisitions on favorable terms and successfully integrate acquired assets or businesses;\n\u2022\nProtection of intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, trade secrets and copyrights, from infringement by others and the potential defense of claims, whether meritorious or not, alleging the unauthorized use of the intellectual property of others;\n\u2022\nTaxation by multiple jurisdictions and the impact of such taxation on effective tax rate and the amount of taxes paid;\n\u2022\nCompliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including the potential impact of compliance failures; and\n\u2022\nThe failure to meet the expectations of investors, including as a result of factors beyond the control of an individual company.", "PERMNO": 91403, "SIC": 3350, "TIC": "KALU"}
