{"cik": "896622", "company": "APTARGROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report and in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business operations. You should carefully consider the following factors in addition to other information contained in this report on Form 10-K before purchasing any shares of our common stock.\nFACTORS AFFECTING OPERATIONS OR OPERATING RESULTS\nWe have foreign currency translation and transaction risks that may materially adversely affect our operating results. A significant number of our operations are located outside of the United States. Because of this, movements in exchange rates may have a significant impact on the translation of the financial statements of our foreign entities. Our primary foreign exchange exposure is to the Euro, but we have foreign exchange exposure to the Brazilian Real, British Pound, Swiss Franc, and other South American and Asian currencies, among others. A strengthening U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies has a dilutive translation effect on our financial statements. Conversely, a weakening U.S. dollar has an additive translation effect. In some cases, we sell products denominated in a currency different from the currency in which the related costs are incurred. We manage our exposures to foreign exchange principally with forward exchange contracts to economically hedge certain transactions and firm purchase and sales commitments denominated in foreign currencies. The volatility of currency exchange rates may materially affect our operating results.\nIf there is deterioration in economic conditions in a particular region or market, our business and operating results could be materially adversely impacted. Due to our strong balance sheet, diverse product offerings, various end-markets served, and our broad geographic presence, we believe we are well positioned to withstand slowness in any one particular region or market. However, economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. A tightening of credit in financial markets or other factors may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers, customers or distributors could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults, inventory or supply challenges and pricing pressures. An interruption in supply may also impact our ability to meet customer demands. Consumer demand for our customers' products and shifting consumer preferences are unpredictable and could have a negative impact on our customers and our customers' demand for our products. A disruption in the credit markets could also restrict our access to capital.\nGeopolitical conditions, such as recent events in Eastern Europe, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Our operations could be disrupted by geopolitical conditions such as international boycotts, acts of war, terrorist activity or other similar events. Such events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our business globally or in certain regions. While we maintain similar manufacturing capacities at different locations and coordinate multi-source supplier programs on many of our materials which would better enable us to respond to these types of events, we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions. In addition, our customers may export their finished products using our dispensing devices that were sold in other regions and an adverse geopolitical event such as recent conflicts in Eastern Europe, may impact the sales of our customers' products and thus indirectly negatively impact the demand for our dispensing solutions.\nIf our expansion initiatives are unsuccessful, our operating results and reputation may suffer. We are expanding our operations in a number of new and existing markets and jurisdictions, including facilities expansions in France and Latin America. Expansion of our operations will continue to require a significant amount of time and attention from our senior management and capital investment. Our expansion activities present considerable challenges and risks, including the general economic and political conditions existing in new markets and jurisdictions that we enter, attracting, training and retaining qualified and talented employees, infrastructure and labor disruptions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the imposition of restrictions by governmental authorities, compliance with current, new and changing governmental laws and regulations and the cost of such compliance activities. We may have limited or no prior experience in certain of these new markets and there is no assurance any of our expansion efforts will be successful. If any of our expansion efforts are unsuccessful, our operating results and reputation may suffer.\nHigher raw material costs and other inputs and an inability to increase our selling prices may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. The cost of raw materials and other inputs (particularly resin, rubber, metal, anodization costs and transportation and energy costs) are volatile and susceptible to rapid and substantial changes due to factors beyond our control, such as changing economic conditions, currency fluctuations, weather conditions, political unrest and instability in energy-producing nations, and supply and demand pressures. Raw material costs may increase in the coming years and, although we have generally been able to increase selling prices to cover increased costs,\n7 /ATR\nForm 10-K\nfuture market conditions may prevent us from passing these increased costs on to our customers through timely price increases. In addition, we may not be able to improve productivity or realize savings from our cost reduction programs sufficiently enough to offset the impact of increased raw material costs. As a result, higher raw material costs could result in declining margins and operating results.\nIn difficult market conditions, our fixed costs structure combined with potentially lower revenues may negatively impact our results. Our business is characterized by high fixed costs and, notwithstanding our utilization of third-party manufacturing capacity, most of our production requirements are met by our own manufacturing facilities. In difficult environments, we are generally faced with a decline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in product demand. During such periods, our plants do not operate at full capacity and the costs associated with this excess capacity are charged directly to cost of sales. Difficult market conditions in the future may adversely affect our utilization rates and consequently our future gross margins, and this, in turn, could have a material negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face strong global competition and our market share could decline. All of the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we continue to experience price competition in all product lines and segments. Competitors include privately and publicly held entities. Our competitors mainly range from regional to international companies, and we also experience some local competition mainly in Asia and Latin America. Some fragrance marketers are sourcing their manufacturing requirements including filling of their product in Asia and importing the finished product back into the United States or Europe. If we are unable to compete successfully, our market share may decline, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The majority of our European and Latin American employees are covered by collective bargaining arrangements made either at the local or national level in their respective countries and approximately 200 of our North American employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory, no assurance can be given that this will continue. If disputes with our unions arise, or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage, we could incur higher labor costs or experience a significant disruption of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial position.\nIf we were to incur a significant product liability claim above our current insurance coverage, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Approximately 29% of our net sales are made to customers in the pharmaceutical industry. If our devices fail to operate as intended, medication prescribed for patients may be under administered, or may be over administered. The failure of our devices to operate as intended may result in a product liability claim against us. We believe we maintain adequate levels of product liability insurance coverage. A product liability claim or claims in our Pharma segment or our other segments in excess of our insurance coverage or not covered by existing insurance may materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe success or failure of our customers' products, particularly in the pharmaceutical market, may materially affect our operating results and financial condition. In the pharmaceutical market, the proprietary nature of our customers' products and the success or failure of their products in the market using our dispensing systems may have a material impact on our operating results and financial condition. We may potentially work for years on modifying our dispensing device to work in conjunction with a customer's drug formulation. If the customer's pharmaceutical product is not approved by regulatory bodies or it is not successful on the market, the associated costs may not be recovered.\nSingle sourced materials and manufacturing sites could adversely impact our ability to deliver product. The Company sources certain materials, especially some resins and rubber components for our pharmaceutical segment, from a single source. Any disruption in the supply of these materials could adversely impact our ability to deliver product to our customers. Similarly, we have certain components and / or products that are manufactured at a single location or from a single machine or mold. Any disruption to the manufacturing process could also adversely impact our ability to deliver product to our customers.\nWe have approximately $330 million in recorded goodwill and changes in future business conditions could cause this asset to become impaired, requiring write-downs that would reduce our operating income. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill amounts annually, or more frequently when evidence of potential impairment exists. The impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. A decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill and, as a result, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. See \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in Part II, Item 7 for additional information.\nGovernment regulation on environmental matters regarding recycling or environmental sustainability policies could impact our business. Future government regulations mandating the use or limitations of certain materials could impact our\n8 /ATR\nForm 10-K\nmanufacturing processes or the technologies we use forcing us to reinvest in alternative materials or assets used in the production of our products.\nIncreased cybersecurity threats could pose a risk to our operations. Increased global information security threats and more sophisticated, targeted computer crime pose a risk to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data, operations and infrastructure. While we do not believe we have experienced a specific cyber incident such as unauthorized access to our systems or disruption of functionality, we attempt to mitigate these types of risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems. We also periodically test our systems for vulnerabilities and have recently on occasion used a third party to conduct such tests. Even with these mitigations, our information systems remain potentially vulnerable to sophisticated cybersecurity threats. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations.\nConsolidation of customer base could impact of business. We believe mergers and acquisitions within our customer base create opportunities for increasing sales due to the breadth of our product line, our international presence and our long-term relationships with certain customers. However, consolidation of our customers could lead to pricing pressures, concentration of credit risk and fewer opportunities to introduce new products to the market.\nFACTOR AFFECTING APTARGROUP STOCK\nOwnership by Certain Significant Shareholders. Currently, Aptar has six shareholders who each own between 5% and 11% of our outstanding common stock. If one of these significant shareholders decides to sell significant volumes of our stock, this could put downward pressure on the price of the stock.", "PERMNO": 79133, "SIC": 3089, "TIC": "ATR"}
