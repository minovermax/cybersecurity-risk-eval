{"cik": "935419", "company": "RCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-12-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below before deciding to purchase shares of our common stock. If any of the events, contingencies, circumstances or conditions described in the risks below actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed. The trading price of our common stock could, in turn, decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nOur Business Operations are Subject to Regulatory Uncertainties Which May Affect Our Ability to Continue Operations of Existing Nightclubs, Acquire Additional Nightclubs or Be Profitable\nAdult entertainment nightclubs are subject to local, state and federal regulations. Our business is regulated by local zoning, local and state liquor licensing, local ordinances and state and federal time place and manner restrictions. The adult entertainment provided by our nightclubs has elements of speech and expression and, therefore, enjoys some protection under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. However, the protection is limited to the expression, and not the conduct of an entertainer. While our nightclubs are generally well established in their respective markets, there can be no assurance that local, state and/or federal licensing and other regulations will permit our nightclubs to remain in operation or profitable in the future.\nOur Business has been, and may Continue to be, Adversely Affected by Conditions in the U.S. Financial Markets and Economic Conditions Generally\nOur nightclubs are often acquired with a purchase price based on historical EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization). This results in certain nightclubs carrying a substantial amount of intangible value, mostly allocated to licenses and goodwill. Generally accepted accounting principles require an annual impairment review of these indefinite lived assets. If difficult market and economic conditions continue over the next year and/or we experience a decrease in revenue at one or more nightclubs, we could incur a decline in fair value of one or more of our nightclubs. This could result in future impairment charges of up to the total value of the indefinite lived intangible assets.\nWe May Need Additional Financing or Our Business Expansion Plans May Be Significantly Limited\nIf cash generated from our operations is insufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, we will need to raise additional funds through the public or private sale of our equity or debt securities. The timing and amount of our capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including cash flow and cash requirements for nightclub acquisitions. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our then-existing shareholders will be reduced. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. Any future equity financing, if available, may result in dilution to existing shareholders, and debt financing, if available, may include restrictive covenants. Any failure by us to procure timely additional financing will have material adverse consequences on our business operations.\nThere is Substantial Competition in the Nightclub Entertainment Industry, Which May Affect Our Ability to Operate Profitably or Acquire Additional Clubs\nOur nightclubs face competition. Some of these competitors may have greater financial and management resources than we do. Additionally, the industry is subject to unpredictable competitive trends and competition for general entertainment dollars. There can be no assurance that we will be able to remain profitable in this competitive industry.\nRisk of Adult Nightclubs Operations\nHistorically, the adult entertainment, restaurant and bar industry has been an extremely volatile industry. The industry tends to be extremely sensitive to the general local economy, in that when economic conditions are prosperous, entertainment industry revenues increase, and when economic conditions are unfavorable, entertainment industry revenues decline. Coupled with this economic sensitivity are the trendy personal preferences of the customers who frequent adult cabarets. We continuously monitor trends in our customers' tastes and entertainment preferences so that, if necessary, we can make appropriate changes which will allow us to remain one of the premiere adult cabarets. However, any significant decline in general corporate conditions or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we have historically catered to a clientele base from the upper end of the market. Accordingly, further reductions in the amounts of entertainment expenses allowed as deductions from income under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, could adversely affect sales to customers dependent upon corporate expense accounts.\nPermits Relating to the Sale of Alcohol\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of alcoholic beverages. States in which we operate may have laws which may limit the availability of a permit to sell alcoholic beverages or which may provide for suspension or revocation of a permit to sell alcoholic beverages in certain circumstances. The temporary or permanent suspension or revocations of any such permits would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition and results of operations. In all states where we operate, management believes we are in compliance with applicable city, county, state or other local laws governing the sale of alcohol.\nActivities or Conduct at Our Nightclubs May Cause Us to Lose Necessary Business Licenses, Expose Us to Liability, or Result in Adverse Publicity, Which May Increase Our Costs and Divert Management\u2019s Attention from Our Business\nWe are subject to risks associated with activities or conduct at our nightclubs that are illegal or violate the terms of necessary business licenses. Some of our nightclubs operate under licenses for sexually oriented businesses and are afforded some protection under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. While we believe that the activities at our nightclubs comply with the terms of such licenses, and that the element of our business that constitutes an expression of free speech under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is protected, activities and conduct at our nightclubs may be found to violate the terms of such licenses or be unprotected under the U.S. Constitution. This protection is limited to the expression and not the conduct of an entertainer. An issuing authority may suspend or terminate a license for a nightclub found to have violated the license terms. Illegal activities or conduct at any of our nightclubs may result in negative publicity or litigation. Such consequences may increase our cost of doing business, divert management\u2019s attention from our business and make an investment in our securities unattractive to current and potential investors, thereby lowering our profitability and our stock price.\nWe have developed comprehensive policies aimed at ensuring that the operation of each nightclub is conducted in conformance with local, state and federal laws. We have a \u201cno tolerance\u201d policy on illegal drug use in or around the facilities. We continually monitor the actions of entertainers, waitresses and customers to ensure that proper behavior standards are met. However, such policies, no matter how well designed and enforced, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the policies\u2019 objectives are being achieved. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems and policies, there can be no assurance that our policies will prevent deliberate acts by persons attempting to violate or circumvent them. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations, management believes that our policies are reasonably effective in achieving their purposes.\nOur Acquisitions May Result in Disruptions in Our Business and Diversion of Management\u2019s Attention\nWe have made and may continue to make acquisitions of complementary nightclubs, restaurants or related operations. Any acquisitions will require the integration of the operations, products and personnel of the acquired businesses and the training and motivation of these individuals. Such acquisitions may disrupt our operations and divert management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations, which could impair our relationships with current employees, customers and partners. We may also incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions. These issuances could be substantially dilutive to our stockholders. In addition, our profitability may suffer because of acquisition-related costs or amortization, or impairment costs for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets. If management is unable to fully integrate acquired business, products or persons with existing operations, we may not receive the benefits of the acquisitions, and our revenues and stock trading price may decrease.\nWe Must Continue to Meet NASDAQ Global Market Continued Listing Requirements or We Risk Delisting\nOur securities are currently listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market. We must continue to satisfy NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements or risk delisting which would have an adverse effect on our business. If our securities are ever de-listed from NASDAQ, they may trade on the over-the-counter market, which may be a less liquid market. In such case, our shareholders\u2019 ability to trade or obtain quotations of the market value of shares of our common stock would be severely limited because of lower trading volumes and transaction delays. These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our securities. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with the NASDAQ continued listing requirements.\nWe Incur Significant Costs as a Result of Operating as a Public Company, and Our Management Devotes Substantial Time to New Compliance Initiatives\nWe will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that our competition does not incur. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, have imposed various requirements on public companies, including requiring certain corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nIn addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we have been required to perform system and process evaluation and testing on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Then, beginning in fiscal 2010, our independent registered public accounting firm has reported on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In the future, our testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. Our compliance with Section 404 requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nUninsured Risks\nWe maintain insurance in amounts we consider adequate for personal injury and property damage to which the business of the Company may be subject. However, there can be no assurance that uninsured liabilities in excess of the coverage provided by insurance, which liabilities may be imposed pursuant to the Texas \"Dram Shop\" statute or similar \"Dram Shop\" statutes or common law theories of liability in other states where we operate or expand. For example, the Texas \"Dram Shop\" statute provides a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to such person if it was apparent to the server that the individual being sold, served or provided with an alcoholic beverage was obviously intoxicated to the extent that he presented a clear danger to himself and others. An employer is not liable for the actions of its employee who over-serves if (i) the employer requires its employees to attend a seller training program approved by the TABC; (ii) the employee has actually attended such a training program; and (iii) the employer has not directly or indirectly encouraged the employee to violate the law. It is our policy to require that all servers of alcohol working at our clubs in Texas be certified as servers under a training program approved by the TABC, which certification gives statutory immunity to the sellers of alcohol from damage caused to third parties by those who have consumed alcoholic beverages at such establishment pursuant to the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Code. There can be no assurance, however, that uninsured liabilities may not arise in the markets in which we operate which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nOur Previous Liability Insurer May Be Unable to Provide Coverage to Us and Our Subsidiaries\nAs previously reported, the Company and its subsidiaries were insured under a liability policy issued by Indemnity Insurance Corporation, RRG (\u201cIIC\u201d) through October 25, 2013. The Company and its subsidiaries changed insurance companies on that date.\nOn November 7, 2013, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware entered a Rehabilitation and Injunction Order (\u201cRehabilitation Order\u201d), which declared IIC impaired, insolvent and in an unsafe condition and placed IIC under the supervision of the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Delaware (\u201cCommissioner\u201d) in her capacity as receiver (\u201cReceiver\u201d). The Rehabilitation Order empowered the Commissioner to rehabilitate IIC through a variety of means, including gathering assets and marshaling those assets as necessary. Further, the order stayed or abated pending lawsuits involving IIC as the insurer until May 6, 2014. Since the expiration of the order the lawsuits have resumed. We are funding 100% of the costs of litigation and will seek reimbursement from the bankruptcy receiver.\nOn April 10, 2014, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware entered a Liquidation and Injunction Order With Bar Date (\u201cLiquidation Order\u201d), which ordered the liquidation of IIC and terminated all insurance policies or contracts of insurance issued by IIC. The Liquidation Order further ordered that all claims against IIC must be filed with the Receiver before the close of business on January 16, 2015 and that all pending lawsuits involving IIC as the insurer are further stayed or abated until October 7, 2014. As a result, the Company and its subsidiaries no longer have insurance coverage under the liability policy with IIC. Currently, there are multiple civil lawsuits pending or threatened against the Company and its subsidiaries; and other potential lawsuits for incidents that occurred before October 25, 2013 could still be filed. The Company has retained counsel to defend against and evaluate these claims and lawsuits. The Company filed the appropriate claims against IIC with the Receiver before the January 16, 2015 deadline; however, there are no assurances of any recovery from these claims. It is unknown at this time what effect this uncertainty will have on the Company. As previously stated, the Company has obtained general liability coverage from another insurer, effective October 25, 2013, which will cover any claims arising from actions after that date.\nLimitations on Protection of Service Marks\nOur rights to the tradenames \u201cRCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc.\u201d, \"Rick's\", \"Rick's Cabaret\", \u201cTootsie\u2019s Cabaret\u201d, \u201cClub Onyx,\u201d \u201cXTC Cabaret,\u201d \u201cTemptations,\u201d \u201cJaguars,\u201d \u201cDowntown Cabaret,\u201d \u201cCabaret East,\u201d Cabaret North,\u201d Bombshells,\u201d \u201cVee Lounge\u201d and \u201cThe Black Orchid\u201d are established under common law, based upon our substantial and continuous use of these tradenames in interstate commerce, some of which have been in use at least as early as 1987. \"RICK'S AND STARS DESIGN\" logo, \u201cRCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.\u201d, \u201cRICKS,\u201d \"RICK'S CABARET\", \u201cCLUB ONYX\u201d, \u201cXTC CABARET,\u201d \u201cSILVER CITY CABARET\u201d, \u201cTHE BLACK ORCHID\u201d, \u201cBOMBSHELLS\u201d and \u201cEXOTIC DANCER\u201d are registered through service mark registrations issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. As of this date we have pending registration applications for the names \u201cTHE SEVILLE\u201d and \u201cDOWN IN TEXAS SALOON\u201d. We also own the rights to numerous tradenames associated with our media division. There can be no assurance that these steps we have taken to protect our Service Marks will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our protected intellectual property rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to protect our rights from infringement, which may be costly and time consuming. The loss of the intellectual property rights owned or claimed by us could have a material adverse affect on our business.\nAnti-takeover Effects of Issuance of Preferred Stock\nThe Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series, to fix the number of shares constituting any such series, and to fix the rights and preferences of the shares constituting any series, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The issuance of Preferred Stock by the Board of Directors could adversely affect the rights of the holders of common stock. For example, such issuance could result in a class of securities outstanding that would have preferences with respect to voting rights and dividends and in liquidation over the common stock, and could (upon conversion or otherwise) enjoy all of the rights appurtenant to common stock. The Board's authority to issue Preferred Stock could discourage potential takeover attempts and could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company through merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise by making such attempts more difficult to achieve or more costly. There are no issued and outstanding shares of Preferred Stock; there are no agreements or understandings for the issuance of Preferred Stock, and the Board of Directors has no present intention to issue Preferred Stock.\nWe Have Not Paid Dividends on Common Shares in the Past\nSince our inception we have not paid any dividends on our common stock.\nFuture Sales of Our Common Stock May Depress Our Stock Price\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or as a result of the perception that these sales could occur. In addition, these factors could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock.\nOur Stock Price Has Been Volatile and May Fluctuate in the Future\nThe trading price of our securities may fluctuate significantly. This price may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022 our performance and prospects;\n\u2022 the depth and liquidity of the market for our securities;\n\u2022 sales by selling shareholders of shares issued or issuable in connection with certain convertible notes;\n\u2022 investor perception of us and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022 changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts;\n\u2022 general financial and other market conditions; and\n\u2022 domestic economic conditions.\nPublic stock markets have experienced, and may experience, extreme price and trading volume volatility. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our securities.\nWe are Dependent on Key Personnel\nOur future success is dependent, in a large part, on retaining the services of Mr. Eric Langan, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Langan possesses a unique and comprehensive knowledge of our industry. While Mr. Langan has no present plans to leave or retire in the near future, his loss could have a negative effect on our operating, marketing and financial performance if we are unable to find an adequate replacement with similar knowledge and experience within our industry. We maintain key-man life insurance with respect to Mr. Langan. Although Mr. Langan is under an employment agreement (as described herein), there can be no assurance that Mr. Langan will continue to be employed by us. The loss of Mr. Langan could have a negative effect on our operating, marketing, and financing performance.\nCumulative Voting is Not Available to Stockholders\nCumulative voting in the election of Directors is expressly denied in our Articles of Incorporation. Accordingly, the holder or holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock may elect all of our Directors.\nOur Directors and Officers Have Limited Liability and Have Rights to Indemnification\nOur Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws provide, as permitted by governing Texas law, that our Directors and officers shall not be personally liable to us or any of our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a Director or officer, with certain exceptions. The Articles further provide that we will indemnify our Directors and officers against expenses and liabilities they incur to defend, settle, or satisfy any civil litigation or criminal action brought against them on account of their being or having been its Directors or officers unless, in such action, they are adjudged to have acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct.\nThe inclusion of these provisions in the Articles may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against Directors and officers, and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against Directors and officers for breach of their duty of care, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited us and our stockholders.\nThe Articles provide for the indemnification of our officers and Directors, and the advancement to them of expenses in connection with any proceedings and claims, to the fullest extent permitted by Texas law. The Articles include related provisions meant to facilitate the indemnitee's receipt of such benefits. These provisions cover, among other things: (i) specification of the method of determining entitlement to indemnification and the selection of independent counsel that will in some cases make such determination, (ii) specification of certain time periods by which certain payments or determinations must be made and actions must be taken, and (iii) the establishment of certain presumptions in favor of an indemnitee.\nInsofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.\nA failure to maintain food safety throughout the supply chain and food-borne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business.\nFood safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that our guests enjoy safe, quality food products. However, food safety issues could be caused at the point of source or by food suppliers or distributors and, as a result, be out of our control. In addition, regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illnesses such as E. coli, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella, and other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination, at one of our restaurants could adversely affect the reputation of our brands and have a negative impact on our sales. Even instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our sales. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs and lower margins.\nWe may experience higher-than-anticipated costs associated with the opening of new establishments which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new nightclub and bar/restaurant establishments. We incur substantial pre-opening expenses each time we open a new establishment. The expenses of opening new locations may be higher than anticipated. An increase in such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOther Risk Factors May Adversely Affect Our Financial Performance\nOther risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements by affecting, among many things, pricing, consumer spending and consumer confidence, include, without limitation, changes in economic conditions and financial and credit markets, credit availability, increased fuel costs and availability for our employees, customers and suppliers, health epidemics or pandemics or the prospects of these events (such as reports on avian flu), consumer perceptions of food safety, changes in consumer tastes and behaviors, governmental monetary policies, changes in demographic trends, terrorist acts, energy shortages and rolling blackouts, and weather (including, major hurricanes and regional snow storms) and other acts of God.", "PERMNO": 82518, "SIC": 5810, "TIC": "RICK"}
