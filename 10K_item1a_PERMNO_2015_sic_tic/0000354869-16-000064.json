Various risks that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation or cash flows, and our liquidity are described below. These risks and uncertainties are not the only risks we face, however.\nOur ERM program incorporates risk management throughout our organization to identify, understand, and manage risks presented by our business activities. Our ERM program identifies the Corporation\u2019s major risk categories as:\n\u2022\ncredit risks, which are the risks of loss due to loan customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms;\n\u2022\nmarket and price risk, which is the risk of loss due to changes in market value of assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nliquidity risk, which is a risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments based on external market issues, investor and customer perception of financial strength, and events unrelated to us such as war, terrorism, or issues affecting the financial services industry, generally, including market disruptions, perceptions, and risk of loss based on our ability to satisfy current or future commitments due to the mix and maturity of our balance sheet, amount of cash on-hand and unencumbered securities and the availability of contingent sources of funding;\n\u2022\noperational risk, which is the risk of loss due to human error, inadequate or failed internal systems and controls, violations of, or noncompliance with laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards, and external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, and security risks;\n\u2022\nlegal and compliance risks, which expose us to money penalties, enforcement actions or other sanctions and damages as a result of nonconformance with laws and regulations that apply to the financial services industry;\n\u2022\nreputation risk, which is the risk from negative public opinion from our constituents and the public;\n\u2022\ninterest rate risk, which is the risk to earnings, asset and liability values, costs and liquidity, asset/liability mixes, customer behaviors and/or capital arising from movements in interest rates;\n\u2022\nfinancial risk, which is the risk associated with financial operations that can occur from incorrect financial reporting, inaccurate reconciliation, lack of segregation of duties, and inadequate controls or management oversight;\n\u2022\ntechnology risk, which is associated with the continuous widespread developments of new technologies, products and services;\n\u2022\npeople risk, which is associated with staff availability, competency, experience, technical expertise, fraud, compensation, and benefits; and\n\u2022\nstrategic risk, which is the risk of loss from adverse business decisions or inadequate implementation of those decisions.\nCREDIT RISKS\nWe may have more credit risk and higher credit losses, and may be required to maintain higher capital levels, to the extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or collateral.\nOur credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or similar activities or to borrowers that as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions. Our regulators may require higher capital levels if we were deemed to have significant loan concentrations, and all federal bank regulators are currently especially sensitive regarding CRE concentrations in the banking industry. Our business strategy includes the origination of commercial and industrial loans and, to a lesser extent, CRE loans, which are generally larger, and have higher risk-adjusted returns and shorter maturities than one-to-four-family mortgage loans. At December 31, 2015, our portfolio of originated commercial and industrial loans totaled $5.8 billion, or 41.03% of total originated loans, and originated commercial real estate loans totaled $2.1 billion or 14.71% of total originated loans. Pools of individual transactions that may perform similarly because of common characteristics or common sensitivity to economic, financial, or business developments have been the primary cause of credit related distress in the financial services industry. If these common characteristics become a common source of weakness, loans in the pool pose risks to earnings and capital, even within a pool that is soundly underwritten at origination.\nWhile we seek to reduce credit risks through our underwriting policies, which generally require that loans be qualified on the basis of the cash flows, collateral, appraised value, and debt service coverage ratio, among other factors, there can be no assurance that our underwriting policies will protect us from credit-related losses or delinquencies.\nThe ability of our borrowers to repay their loans could be adversely affected by weakness in economic conditions.\nOur business depends significantly on general economic conditions in our markets in Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Chicago, Illinois, and Western Pennsylvania. Accordingly, the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, and the value of the collateral securing such loans, may be significantly affected by general economic conditions in these regions or by changes in the local real estate markets. A significant decline in general economic conditions caused by changes in inflation or deflation, recession, unemployment, changes in government fiscal and monetary policies, acts of terrorism, or other factors beyond our control could cause our borrowers to default on their loan payments, and the collateral values securing such loans to decline and be insufficient to repay any outstanding indebtedness. In such events, we could experience significant loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Fiscal and Monetary Policies.\u201d\nVarious factors may cause our allowance for loan losses to increase.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses (a reserve established through provisions for loan losses charged as expenses on our income statements) that represents our estimate of losses based on our evaluation of risk within our existing portfolio of loans. The level of the allowance reflects our ongoing evaluation of industry concentrations, specific credit risks, historical levels of loan losses, projected default rates and loss severities, present economic, political and regulatory conditions, incurred losses inherent in the current loan portfolios, and whether or not the loans are covered by loss sharing agreements with the FDIC with respect to our FDIC assisted acquisitions. Approximately $88.4 million of residential mortgage loans remained covered by FDIC loss sharing at December 31, 2015. If our estimated assumptions and judgments regarding such matters prove to be incorrect, our allowance for loan losses might not be sufficient to cover losses in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, including adverse changes in unemployment and real estate values, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance through additional provisions for loan losses. Furthermore, our bank regulators periodically review our allowance and the regulators\u2019 judgments can differ from those of Management, which may require increases to the provision for loan losses or further loan charge-offs. Material additions to the allowance through provisions for loan losses or loan charge-offs could materially decrease our net income and capital. Additional information regarding our allowance for loan losses is included in Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in the sections captioned \u201cAllowance for Loan Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments\u201d and \u201cAsset Quality.\u201d We have made and may make additional FDIC assisted acquisitions of failed banks, which could present additional risks to our business. See \u201cWe have made and may make additional FDIC assisted acquisitions of failed banks, which could present additional risks to our business.\u201d\nMARKET AND PRICE RISK\nMarket conditions and economic trends may adversely affect our industry and our business.\nOur success depends, to a certain extent, upon economic and political conditions, local and national, as well as governmental fiscal and monetary policies. Conditions such as inflation or deflation, recession, wages and business income, unemployment, taxes, changes in interest rates, money supply and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our asset quality, loan and deposit levels and margins and, therefore, our earnings and our capital. Because we have a significant amount of real estate loans, decreases in the value of real estate collateral securing the payment of such loans or low values and/or low sales could result in increased delinquencies, foreclosures and customer bankruptcies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our credit losses and on our operating results. Adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on our borrowers\u2019 ability to make timely payments of their loans, which could have adverse effects on our earnings and cash flows.\nOverall, while economic and market conditions have improved in the United States since the credit crisis and in our primary geographic markets, there can be no assurance that these improvements will continue or that the economic and market conditions will not deteriorate in the future.\nOur profitability depends on economic conditions in our primary market areas.\nA majority of our lending and deposit gathering activities are to individuals and small- to medium-sized businesses in Ohio, Chicago, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and Western Pennsylvania, and our profitability\ndepends in part on the general economic conditions of these areas. Real estate values in Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and Western Pennsylvania continue to be negatively affected by the slow economic recovery. Worsening conditions in the national economy and/or changes in interest rates also could reduce our growth rate, impair our ability to collect payments on loans, increase delinquencies, increase problem assets and foreclosures and related expenses, increase claims and lawsuits, decrease the demand for, and/or change the mix of our products and services and decrease the value and liquidity of collateral for loans, especially real estate values, which could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nThe actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions could affect our ability to engage in routine funding transactions and the risks of our counterparties. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties, and execute transactions with various counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may increase when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of our collateralized exposure. Such losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nCompetitive product and pricing pressures among financial institutions within our markets may change.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment, which is characterized by competition from a number of other financial institutions nationally, and in each market in which we operate. We compete in terms of products, pricing and service with commercial banks, savings banks, credit unions, and investment banks for deposits and competitive products, and with the same financial institutions and others (including mortgage brokers, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage houses) for loans. We also compete with companies that solicit loans and deposits over the Internet. This significant competition in attracting and retaining deposits and making loans as well as in providing other financial services may adversely affect our growth and future earnings.\nOur success depends, in part, on the ability to develop and offer competitive products and services. There is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices and at a faster pace. This can reduce net interest income and non-interest income from fee-based products and services. In addition, new technology-driven products and services are often introduced and adopted, which could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to modify or adapt existing products and services, develop new products and services, and develop new means of delivering our products and services. We may not be successful in introducing new products and services, or in achieving market acceptance. We could lose business, be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients, or be subject to cost increases. New delivery systems and customer preferences may adversely affect our existing systems, including our branch network and we may have to incur the costs and risks of changing legacy delivery systems and locations. As a result, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nLIQUIDITY RISK\nLiquidity risks associated with loan and deposit demand and the wholesale funding markets could adversely affect our financial results and condition.\nWe require sufficient liquidity to meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals, payments on our debt obligations as they come due and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and other unpredictable circumstances causing industry or general financial market stress. An inability to raise funds through deposits or borrowings, including repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased, FHLB advances and other means, secured and unsecured, at a reasonable cost could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity and earnings. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy generally. Factors that could adversely affect our access to liquidity sources include increased funding costs associated with higher interest rates, difficult credit market conditions, the liquidity needs of our depositors, and the availability of market liquidity, generally.\nOur primary source of liquidity is our core deposit base, which is raised through our retail branch system. Additional available wholesale sources of liquidity include advances from the FHLB, issuances through dealers in the capital markets and access to certificates of deposit issued through brokers. Additionally, a portfolio of high-quality unencumbered, or unpledged, investment securities is available for pledging to meet liquidity needs through federal funds and repurchase agreement borrowings. Alternative sources of liquidity may be available to us in the markets from the sale of debt or equity, depending upon market conditions at the time. Our ability to use brokered deposits is affected by regulatory views that limit the aggregate amount of brokered deposits considered appropriate, as well as the adverse effects these could have on our FDIC deposit insurance assessments.\nIn September 2014, U.S. regulatory agencies finalized rules intended to implement Basel III liquidity requirements. The regulations apply a modified liquidity coverage ratio to bank holding companies with more than $50 billion in total assets. These liquidity rules began phasing in on January 1, 2015, but do not apply to organizations our size. These rules may affect industry demand for deposit funding and may lead to increased competition and costs for certain deposits and other sources of liquidity.\nCapital and liquidity requirements imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act will require banks and BHCs to maintain more and higher quality capital than has historically been the case.\nThe Corporation and the Bank are each subject to capital adequacy rules and liquidity guidelines and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital and liquidity that must be maintained. From time to time, the regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines. If we fail to meet these minimum guidelines and requirements, we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in the types and volumes of activities we may conduct and may be prohibited from taking certain capital actions, such as paying dividends and volumes, repurchasing or redeeming capital securities and paying discretionary bonuses, all of which may otherwise be in the best interests of our business and our shareholders.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act and bank rules, we are required to perform annual stress testing, which may result in increased capital needs depending on the risk indicated from the stress testing.\nWe may elect to raise additional capital to support our business growth or to finance acquisitions, or as a result of losses. Our ability to raise additional capital will depend on our financial performance, conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we can raise additional capital if needed or on terms and costs acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, growth and prospects.\nMaintaining higher levels of capital and liquidity may reduce our profitability and otherwise adversely affect our business, and financial condition.\nWe are a holding company and depend on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds.\nThe Corporation is an entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The Bank conducts most of our operations and the Corporation depends upon dividends from the Bank to service the Corporation's debt and to pay dividends to Corporation's shareholders. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition including liquidity and capital adequacy of the Bank and other factors, that the OCC could limit the payment of dividends or other payments by the Bank. In addition, the payment of dividends by our other subsidiaries is also subject to the laws of the subsidiary\u2019s state of incorporation, and regulatory capital and liquidity requirements applicable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2015, the Bank could pay dividends of $438.2 million without prior OCC approval. In the event that the Bank was unable to pay dividends to us, we in turn would likely have to reduce or stop paying dividends on our Preferred and Common Stock. Our failure to pay dividends on our Preferred stock and Common Stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock. Additional information regarding dividend restrictions is provided in Item 1. \u201cBusiness\u201d in the section captioned \u201cRegulation and Supervision - Dividends and Transactions with Affiliates.\u201d\nA reduction in our credit rating could adversely affect our ability to raise funds including capital, and/or the holders of our securities.\nThe credit rating agencies rating our indebtedness regularly evaluate the Corporation and the Bank, and credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and ability to generate earnings, as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry, the economy, and changes in rating methodologies. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our current credit ratings. A downgrade of the credit ratings of the Corporation or the Bank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and capital, and could significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us or purchase our securities. This could affect our growth, profitability and financial condition, including liquidity.\nOPERATIONAL RISK\nOperational difficulties, failure of our systems or information security incidents, including as a result of cyber attacks or data privacy breaches, could adversely affect our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses.\nThe Corporation is exposed to many types of operational risk, failure of the Corporation\u2019s controls and procedures and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or\nrecordkeeping errors or those resulting from computer or telecommunications systems malfunctions, and fraud or theft. Given the high volume of transactions that occur in a financial services business, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are identified and resolved. In particular, the Corporation\u2019s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on its technology systems and networks. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the Corporation\u2019s customer relationships, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems, and breaches of our customers\u2019 data privacy.\nThe Corporation also faces the risk of operational disruption, failure or capacity constraints due to its dependency on third-party vendors for components of its business infrastructure. While the Corporation has selected and monitors these third-party vendors through our vendor management processes, it does not control their operations. As such, any failure on the part of these business partners to perform their various responsibilities could also adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s business and operations.\nThe Corporation may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control, which may include, for example, computer viruses, cyber attacks, spikes in transaction volume and/or customer activity, electrical or telecommunications outages, or natural disasters. Although the Corporation has programs in place related to business continuity, disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of its systems, business applications and customer information, such disruptions may give rise to interruptions in service to customers, loss of data privacy and loss or liability to the Corporation.\nAny failure or interruption in the Corporation\u2019s operations or information systems, or any security or data breach, could cause reputational damage, jeopardize the confidentiality of customer information, result in a loss of customer business, subject the Corporation to regulatory intervention or expose it to civil litigation and financial loss or liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nFurther, the Corporation may be affected by data breaches at retailers and other third parties who participate in data interchanges with us and our customers that involve the theft of customer credit and debit card data, which may include the theft of the Corporation\u2019s debit card PIN numbers and commercial card information used to make purchases at such retailers and other third parties. Such data breaches could result in us incurring significant expenses to reissue debit cards and cover losses, which could result in a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nTo date, we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches, but there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks or attempted breaches, or incur such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature and growth of these threats, our plans to continue to implement and increase Internet and mobile banking to meet customer demand, and the current economic and political environment. As cyber and other data security threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have significant effects on our ability to conduct business. In addition, such events could materially and adversely affect business and economic conditions in our markets and nationally, the stability of our deposit base, the ability of our borrowers to repay outstanding loans, the value of collateral securing loans, which could reduce our revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. Although Management has established business continuity and disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to risk of environmental liability we own or operate.\nDuring the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and real estate collateral. As a result, we could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these and other properties that we may own and/or operate. We may be held liable by governmental entity or third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or operator of a contaminated site, we may become subject to claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to a variety of risks in connection with any sale of loans we may conduct and any servicing of such loans.\nWe sell loans and participation or syndicated interest in loans. Among other loans sales, we have sold residential mortgage loans to GSEs, while retaining servicing as part of its mortgage banking activities. The Corporation provides customary representations and warranties to the GSEs in conjunction with these sales. If any of these representations and warranties is incorrect, we may be required to indemnify the purchaser for any related losses, or we may be required to repurchase part or all of the effected loans. We may also be required to repurchase loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default by the borrower on a loan we have sold. If we are required to make any indemnity payments or repurchases and do not have a remedy available to us against a solvent counterparty, we may not be able to recover our losses resulting from these indemnity payments and repurchases. Mortgage service obligations are increasing and are subject to CFPB and other regulatory scrutiny and new requirements, which may increase our costs of loan servicing and expose us to additional liabilities. Consequently, our results of operations and financial conditions may be adversely affected.\nWe depend upon the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit, accept customer relationships, or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we rely on information provided to us by customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of customers, counterparties, or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. The majority of our customers are consumers and small- and medium-sized businesses that may not have the same sophisticated internal controls and financial reporting systems as larger businesses. We also consider such customer and counterparty information as part of our anti-money laundering processes. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted to the extent we receive and rely on financial statements, credit reports, or other financial or customer or counterparty information that turn out to be inaccurate or misleading.\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision.\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, which has increased in recent years due to the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and other financial and regulatory initiatives. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors, the FDIC's DIF and the banking system as a whole, not our debtholders or shareholders. These regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, ability to repurchase or redeem our capital securities, and growth, the types, products and services we offer, and the types of customers we acquire or retain, among other things. Further, we must obtain approval from our regulators before engaging in certain expansion and other activities, and our regulators have the ability to compel us to, or restrict us from, taking certain actions entirely. There can be no assurance that any regulatory approvals we may require will be obtained, either in a timely manner or at all. Any regulatory approvals may include conditions or commitments that limit the activities proposed.\nCongress, state legislatures, and federal and state regulatory agencies continually review and change banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies or their interpretation or implementation could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. These changes could subject us to additional compliance costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and the manner and costs of these offerings, and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. In general, the CFPB and other bank regulators have increased their focus on consumer compliance, and we expect this focus to continue. Additional compliance requirements can be costly to implement, may require additional compliance personnel and may limit our ability to offer competitive products to our customers, especially in light of increasing competition for loans by generally unregulated or lightly regulated lenders.\nRecent areas of legislative focus include housing finance reform and cyber security. Regulations and laws may be modified at any time, and new legislation may be enacted that will affect us and our subsidiaries. Any changes in any federal and state law, as well as regulations and governmental policies, income tax laws and accounting principles, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in civil or criminal sanctions by state and federal agencies, civil money penalties and restitution and/or reputation damage, which could have material adverse effects on our business, our ability to expand by acquisition or otherwise, financial condition\nand results of operations. Failure to comply with anti-money laundering laws could be a basis for the revocation of the Bank charter. See \u201cRegulation and Supervision\u201d in Item 1. \u201dBusiness\u201d for more information about the regulations to which we are subject. Additionally, our regulatory position is discussed in greater detail in Note 22 (Regulatory Matters) in the consolidated financial statements.\nThe regulatory environment for the financial services industry is being significantly affected by financial regulatory reform initiatives, including the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted in July 2010, was a comprehensive overhaul of financial services industry regulation. There are a number of reform provisions that are likely to significantly impact the ways in which banks and bank holding companies, including us and the Bank, do business.\nMany provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have yet to be implemented and will require rulemaking and interpretation by federal regulators. We are closely monitoring all relevant sections of the Dodd-Frank Act to ensure continued compliance with laws and regulations. While the ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on us cannot currently be determined, the law and its implementing rules and regulations are likely to continue to increase our compliance costs and the costs of noncompliance, including possible restrictions on our operations, all of which may have a material adverse affect on our operating results and financial condition. See \u201cRegulation and Supervision\u201d in Item 1. \u201cBusiness.\u201d\nWe have been and will continue to be the subject of litigation which could result in legal liability and damage to our business and reputation.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to claims or legal action from customers, employees and/or others. Financial institutions are facing significant class actions, which have included claims challenging the assessment of fees, such as overdraft fees. Past, present and future litigation have included or could include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages, disgorgement of previously earned, current or future profits, or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. We are also involved from time to time in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our business. The CFPB is also considering limiting the use of dispute arbitration provisions, which could result in more litigation at higher cost than arbitration. These matters also could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. Like other large financial institutions, we are also subject to risk from potential employee misconduct, including non-compliance with policies and improper use or disclosure of confidential information. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory actions against us could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and/or cause significant reputational harm to our business. Additional information regarding litigation is included in Note 19 (Commitments and Guarantees) in the consolidated financial statements and in Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d\nOur FDIC deposit insurance assessments may increase.\nOur FDIC deposit insurance assessments may increase due to growth in our deposit assessment base (average consolidated assets less average tangible capital), as well as changes in our risk ratings, and also due to further changes in the FDIC assessments. The FDIC\u2019s October 2015 NPR proposes to surcharge insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more and grant credits to banks with fewer assets for the portion of their regular assessments to fund an increase in the DIF\u2019s reserve\nratio from 1.15 % to 1.35 % by the end of September 2020. This proposal, if adopted, likely would increase our FDIC insurance assessments.\nREPUTATION RISKS\nNegative publicity could damage our reputation and could significantly harm our business.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors, and highly-skilled management and employees is affected by our reputation. Public perception of the financial services industry in general was damaged as a result of the credit crisis that started in 2008. We face increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the credit crisis and economic downturn. Significant harm to our reputation can also arise from other sources, including employee misconduct, actual or perceived unethical behavior, conflicts of interest, litigation, GSE or regulatory actions, failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality, failing to address customer and agency complaints, compliance failures, unauthorized release of confidential information due to cyber attacks or otherwise, and the activities of our clients, customers and counterparties, including vendors. Actions by the financial service industry generally or by institutions or individuals in the industry can adversely affect our reputation, indirectly by association. All of these could adversely affect our growth, results of operation and financial condition.\nINTEREST RATE RISKS\nChanges in interest rates and financial market values could change our mix of assets and liabilities, adversely affect our net interest income and earnings, and negatively impact the value of our loans, securities, and other assets.\nOur primary source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income generated by our interest-earning assets (consisting primarily of loans and, to a lesser extent, securities) and the interest expense generated by our interest-bearing liabilities (consisting primarily of deposits and wholesale borrowings). Prevailing economic conditions, fiscal and monetary policies and the policies of various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit, which, in turn, significantly affect financial institutions\u2019 net interest income. During the last seven years, the Federal Reserve has maintained low interest rates, which have reduced our funding costs, but which have adversely affected the banking industry\u2019s net interest income, and the returns realizable on our loans and investments. If the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than increases in the interest we receive on loans and investments, net interest income, and, therefore, our earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings. Volatility in interest rates can also result in disintermediation, which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments, such as federal government and corporate securities and other investment vehicles, which, may pay higher rates of interests than deposits.\nChanges in interest rates could influence the amount of interest we receive on loans and securities, the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, and the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities and our liquidity. Increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand, reduce loan growth, including residential mortgage origination, and decrease the values of our securities and collateral for loans we have made and could result in higher credit losses as borrowers may have more difficulty making higher interest payments.\nCertain securities in our investment portfolio, most notably MBS, are very sensitive to rising and falling rates. Generally when rates rise, prepayments of principal and interest will decrease and the duration of MBS will increase. Conversely, when rates fall, prepayments of principal and interest will increase and the duration of MBS will decrease. In either case, interest rates will have a significant impact on the value of MBS investments.\nAll of these could adversely affect our growth, results of operation and financial condition including liquidity.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nChanges in accounting policies or accounting standards, and changes in how accounting standards are interpreted or applied, could materially impact our financial statements.\nFrom time to time, accounting standards setters change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. Additionally, those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC and banking regulators) may change or even reverse prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes may be beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in material changes to previously reported financial results, or a material cumulative charge to retained earnings.\nOur accounting policies are fundamental to determining and understanding our financial results and condition. Some of these policies require Management to use estimates and judgment about matters that are uncertain. In some cases, Management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in us reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative. Any changes in accounting policies could materially affect our financial statements. Among other proposals, the FASB is working on a new \u201cCurrent Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) model to determine losses in the loan and held to maturity securities portfolios. Compared to the current standards which are based on historic experience, CECL is forward looking. Depending on whether CECL is adopted and its final terms, this proposed accounting standard could materially affect our allowance for loan loss methodology in future periods and our financial condition and results of operations, including our costs to implement such a standard.\nWe have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. See \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d in Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in the consolidated financial statements.\nOur financial statements depend on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires our Management to evaluate the Corporation\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting and requires our auditors to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting. Our banking regulations also evaluate our internal controls. We are required to disclose, in our annual reports on Form 10-K, the existence of any \u201cmaterial weaknesses\u201d in our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot assure that we will not identify one or more material or other weaknesses as of the end of any given quarter or year, nor can we predict the effect on our stock price of disclosure of a material weakness.\nThe value of our deferred tax assets could adversely affect our operating results and regulatory capital ratios.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Corporation had approximately $252.4 million in net deferred tax assets. The value of our deferred tax assets also could be adversely affected by a change in statutory tax rates. As of January 1, 2015, the Basel III capital rules began phasing in and will be fully phased in by 2019. Our deferred tax assets are subject to an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized for financial statement purposes. In making this determination, we consider all positive and negative evidence available including the impact of recent operating results as well as potential carryback of tax to prior years\u2019 taxable income, reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and projected earnings within the statutory tax loss carryover period. We have determined that the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized at December 31, 2015. If we were to conclude that a significant portion of our deferred tax assets were not more likely than not to be realized, the required valuation allowance could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and regulatory capital ratios.\nThe portion of our deferred tax assets includable in our regulatory capital will decrease under the U.S. Basel III capital rules. See \u201cRegulation and Supervision - Capital.\u201d\nOur goodwill could become impaired in the future. If goodwill were to become impaired, it could limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to our holding company, adversely impacting the holding company's liquidity and ability to pay dividends or repay debt.\nThe most significant assumptions affecting our goodwill impairment evaluation are variables including the market price of our Common Stock, projections of earnings, and the control premium above our current stock price that an acquirer would pay to obtain control of us. We are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually or when impairment indicators are present. If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and book value of goodwill will be reduced by the amount of the impairment. If an impairment loss is recorded, it will have little or no impact on the tangible book value of our Common Stock, or our regulatory capital levels, but such an impairment loss could significantly reduce the Bank\u2019s earnings and thereby restrict the Bank's ability to make dividend payments to us without prior regulatory approval. At December 31, 2015, the book value of our goodwill was $741.7 million, all of which was recorded at the Bank. Any such write down of goodwill or other acquisition related intangibles will reduce the Corporation\u2019s earnings, as well. Federal Reserve policy states the bank holding company dividends should be paid from current earnings.\nTECHNOLOGY RISKS\nWe may not be able to utilize technology to efficiently and effectively develop, market, and deliver new products and services to our customers.\nThe continuous, widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services, smart phones and other mobile devices, requires us to evaluate and change our product and service offerings to remain competitive. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to adapt our products and services, as well as our distribution of them, to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences. New technologies have altered consumer behavior by allowing consumers to complete transactions such as paying bills and transferring funds, and obtaining loans, directly outside historical banking transactions. New products allow consumers to maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits. The process of eliminating or reducing the role of banks as intermediaries, known as disintermediation, could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits, loans and related income generated from those deposits.\nThe increasing pressure from our competitors, both bank and non-bank, to keep pace and adopt new technologies and products and services may require us to incur substantial expense. We may be unsuccessful in developing or introducing new products or services, modifying our existing products and services, adapting to changing customer preferences and spending, saving and borrowing habits, achieving market acceptance or regulatory approval, sufficiently developing or maintaining a loyal customer base or offering products and services at prices and service levels competitive with those offered by our non-bank and bank competitors. These risks may affect our ability to grow and could reduce both our revenue streams from certain products and services and our net interest margin. Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur business is highly reliant on technology and our ability to manage the operational risks associated with technology.\nOur business involves storing and processing sensitive customer data. A cyber security breach may result in the theft of such data or disruption of our transaction processing systems. We depend on internal systems and outsourced technology to support these data storage and processing operations. If we or our customers are unable to use or access these information systems consistently or at critical points in time, this could unfavorably impact the timeliness and efficiency of our business operations, as well as our reputation and customary relationships. A material breach of customer data security may negatively impact our business reputation and cause a loss of customers, result in increased expense to restore our systems and remediate the breach, and/or require that we provide credit monitoring services for affected customers. Regulatory and enforcement actions and/or litigation also could result. Cyber security is increasingly important in light of growing cyber risks and the increased use of internet and mobile and electronic banking services. Cyber\nrisk management programs are expensive to maintain and will not protect the Corporation from a wide range of changing risks and threats associated with maintaining the security of customer data and the Corporation\u2019s proprietary data from external and internal intrusions, disaster recovery and failures in the controls used by our vendors. In addition, Congress and the legislatures of states in which we operate regularly consider legislation that would impose more stringent data privacy requirements.\nPEOPLE RISKS\nWe may be unable to attract or retain key officers and employees.\nThe Corporation\u2019s future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of its executive officers and key personnel. The Corporation\u2019s future operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management, financial, technical, marketing, sales, compliance, and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and the Corporation cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and it may be increasingly difficult and costly for the Corporation to hire personnel over time. Regulatory rules regarding financial institutions limit incentive compensation where it may be deemed to promote undue risk taking, and the regulatory focus on compliance may affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified people who expect incentive compensation, and have increased the compensation paid to and costs of compliance personnel, respectively.\nLoss of key employees may disrupt relationships with certain customers.\nOur business is primarily relationship-driven, and many of our key employees have extensive customer relationships. Loss of a key employee with such customer relationships may lead to the loss of business if the customers were to follow that employee or teams of key people to a competitor. Loss of such key personnel, should they enter into an employment relationship with one of our competitors, could result in the loss of customers and potential adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition.\nSTRATEGIC RISKS\nOur business strategy includes planned growth. Our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.\nWe continue to pursue a growth strategy both within our existing markets and in new markets. Our ability to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors, including the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, the quality of people and services, the competitive responses from other financial institutions in our market areas and our ability to integrate acquisitions and manage our growth. Our April 2013 acquisition of Citizens reflects this strategy. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies seeking significant growth. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to expand our market presence in our existing markets or successfully enter new markets or that any such expansion will not adversely affect our results of operations, even if only on a short-term basis. Failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, future prospects, financial condition or results of operations and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Also, if we grow more slowly than anticipated or fail to successfully integrate newly acquired operations, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. Our Merger Agreement with Huntington requires us to operate in the ordinary course of business prior to completion of the Merger and limits expansion without Huntington\u2019s prior consent. See \u201cWe will be subject to contractual restrictions and business uncertainties while the Merger with Huntington is pending\u201d.\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating acquired assets and expanding our operations into new geographic areas and markets.\nThe market areas in Michigan and Wisconsin served by the assets and branches we acquired as part of our acquisition of Citizens in April 2013 are areas where we previously did not conduct significant banking activities. Our ability to compete effectively in these new markets will depend on our ability to understand the local market and competitive dynamics and identify and retain and attract key employees knowledgeable in these markets. We may also encounter obstacles when incorporating the acquired operations with our operations and management.\nOur loans, deposits, fee businesses and employees have increased as a result of our organic growth and acquisitions. Our failure to successfully manage and support this growth with sufficient human resources, training and operational, financial and technology resources in challenging markets and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. We may not be able to sustain our historical growth rates.\nWe face risks with respect to expansion activities.\nWe may acquire other financial institutions or parts of those institutions in the future, and we may engage in de novo branch expansion. We may also consider and enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services. Acquisitions and mergers involve a number of expenses and risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger targets and seeking regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nthe estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution may not be accurate and we may face risks of unknown contingent liabilities;\n\u2022\nthe exposures to potential asset quality issues with respect to acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nthe time and costs of evaluating new markets, retaining or hiring experienced local management and opening new offices, and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion and unanticipated delays;\n\u2022\nour ability to finance an acquisition and possible increased costs and dilution to our existing shareholders;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention to the negotiation of a transaction, and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses;\n\u2022\nentry into new markets or products where we have limited experience;\n\u2022\nrisks that growth will strain our infrastructure, staff, internal controls, management and operations, which may require additional personnel, time and expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new products and services into our business;\n\u2022\nthe creation and possible impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with an acquisition and potential short-term decreases in profitability;\n\u2022\nthe customer disruption, time, costs, and technology and other risks of integrating our operations systems and product with an acquired business; and\n\u2022\nthe risk of loss of key employees, customers, assets and deposits.\nWe may incur substantial costs to expand, and there is no assurance such expansion including costs for transactions or new products will be completed or launched. There can be no assurance that integration efforts for any future mergers or acquisitions will be successful. Also, we may issue equity and/or debt securities in connection with future acquisitions, which could increase any costs, and dilute our current shareholders. There is no assurance that, following any future mergers or acquisitions, our integration efforts will be successful or that, after giving effect to the acquisition, we will achieve profits comparable to or better than our historical experience, or that we will realize the benefits, including cost savings, which we originally estimated, in connection with any such transaction.\nWe have made and may make additional FDIC assisted acquisitions of failed banks, which could present additional risks to our business.\nWe made two FDIC assisted acquisitions in 2010, both with loss sharing agreements with the FDIC. As of December 31, 2015, total assets under loss sharing agreements, or \u201ccovered assets,\u201d with the FDIC were $88.4 million of residential mortgage loans. Loss sharing agreements on all other types of loans expired in February and May 2015 . Loss sharing on residential mortgage loans are scheduled to expire in February and May 2020. We may consider additional opportunities to acquire the assets and liabilities of failed banks in FDIC assisted transactions, which present the risks of acquisitions, generally, as well as some risk specific to these transactions. Although these FDIC assisted transactions typically provide for FDIC assistance to an acquiror to mitigate certain risks, which may or may not include loss sharing agreements, where the FDIC absorbs certain losses on covered assets and provides some indemnity, we would be subject to many of the same risks we would face in acquiring another bank in a negotiated transaction, without FDIC assistance, including risks associated with pricing such transactions, the risks of loss of deposits and maintaining customer relationships and failure to realize the anticipated acquisition benefits in the amounts and within the time frames we expect. In addition, because these acquisitions provide for limited diligence and negotiation of termsand involve risks due to the target\u2019s failure, FDIC assisted transactions may require additional resources and time, costs related to integration of personnel and operating systems, the establishment of processes and time required to service acquired assets including acquired problem loans and may require us to raise additional capital, which may be dilutive to our existing shareholders. Loss sharing agreements with the FDIC also involves additional reporting to and examination by the FDIC of our performance under the loss sharing agreements. Loss sharing assets create volatility in earnings based on performance of assets covered by loss sharing agreements. In general, the receivable from the FDIC is reduced with an adverse effect on earnings as performance of covered assets improves versus expectations, which adversely affect our net income for the related periods. We and the FDIC also may disagree as to the value or treatment of certain assets and liabilities under failed bank acquisition agreements with the FDIC.\nIf we are unable to manage these risks, FDIC assisted acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur organizational documents, state laws and regulated industry may discourage a third-party from acquiring us by means of a tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated code of regulations, certain laws of the State of Ohio, and certain aspects of the BHCA and other governing statutes and regulations, may have the effect of discouraging a tender offer or other takeover attempt not previously approved by our Board of Directors.\nCertain provisions in our charter documents and Ohio law may prevent a change in management or a takeover attempt that you may consider to be in your best interest.\nWe are subject to Chapter 1704 of the Ohio Revised Code, which prohibits certain business combinations and transactions between an \u201cissuing public corporation\u201d and an \u201cOhio law interested shareholder\u201d for at least three years after the Ohio law interested shareholder attains 10% ownership, unless the Board of Directors of the issuing public corporation approves the transaction before the Ohio law interest shareholder attains 10% ownership. We are also subject to Section 1701.831 of the Ohio Revised Code, which provides that certain notice and informational filings and special shareholder meeting and voting procedures must be followed prior to consummation of a proposed \u201ccontrol share acquisition.\u201d Assuming compliance with the notice and information filings prescribed by the statute, a proposed control share acquisition may be made only if the acquisition is approved by a majority of the voting power of the issuer represented at the meeting and at least a majority of the voting power remaining after excluding the combined voting power of the \u201cinterested shares.\u201d\nCertain provisions contained in our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated code of regulations and Ohio law could delay or prevent the removal of directors and other management and could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us that you may consider to be in your best interest more difficult. For example, these provisions:\n\u2022\nallow our Board of Directors to issue preferred shares without shareholder approval;\n\u2022\nlimit who can call a special meeting of shareholders; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the Board of Directors.\nThese provisions, as well certain aspects of the BHCA and other governing statutes and regulations, may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our Common Stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of our Common Stock.\nThese provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our Board of Directors.\nWe will be subject to contractual restrictions and business uncertainties while the Merger with Huntington is pending.\nAlthough there is no assurance as to the exact timing, the Merger currently is expected to close in the third quarter of 2016. The Merger Agreement requires us to operate in the ordinary course of business pending the Merger\u2019s completion, including restricting us from certain activities, including making acquisitions or opening of new branches, divestitures, issuance of securities and other customary restrictions without Huntington\u2019s consent. These restrictions may limit or prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger, and which we might pursue absent the Merger Agreement.\nUncertainty about the effects of the Merger and the Bank Merger, including branch consolidation and any divestitures that may be required, on our employees and customers may have an adverse effect on us. Certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles. These uncertainties may make it more difficult for us to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed, and could cause our customers and others that deal with us to consider changing existing business relationships with us. It is not unusual for competitors to use mergers as an opportunity to seek the merging parties\u2019 customers and to hire\ncertain of their staffs. If key employees depart the Corporation or the Bank in light of uncertainty over the Merger or our integration efforts with Huntington, our business could be adversely affected.\nTermination of the Merger Agreement could negatively affect us.\nIf, for any reason, the Merger Agreement is terminated, our business may be adversely affected as a result of not pursuing other beneficial opportunities prior to such termination and our management focus on completing the Merger. If the Merger Agreement is terminated and our board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, we may not be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration Huntington has agreed to provide in the Merger, especially if the termination fee of $100.6 million becomes payable as a result. See \u201cOur business strategy includes planned growth. Our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.\u201d\nAs of December 31, 2015, our goodwill was $741.7 million. In the event the Merger Agreement is terminated, the market price of Corporation common stock might decline to the extent that the current market price reflects assumptions that the Merger will be completed. In the event the Merger is terminated and the market price of Corporation common stock declines, we will evaluate whether a goodwill impairment would be recognized. See \u201cOur goodwill could become impaired in the future. If goodwill were to become impaired, it could limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to our holding company, adversely impacting the holding company\u2019s liquidity and ability to pay dividends or repay debt.\u201d", "PERMNO": 35167, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FMER"}
