You should consider the following factors carefully, in addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase or otherwise trade the Company\u2019s securities.\nThis Form 10-K and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the Company contain statements that, to the extent they are not recitations of historical fact, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities law. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and are based on assumptions that the Company believes in good faith are reasonable, but which may be materially different from actual results. Investors can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate only to historic or current facts. The words \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201coutlook,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cscheduled,\u201d and similar expressions in connection with future events or future operating or financial performance are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Any or all of the Company\u2019s forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K and in other publications may turn out to be wrong.\nStatements and assumptions on future revenues, income and cash flows, performance, economic trends, the outcome of litigation, regulatory compliance, and environmental remediation cost estimates are examples of forward-looking statements. Numerous factors, including potentially the risk factors described in this section, could affect our forward-looking statements and actual performance.\nInvestors are also cautioned that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties. Other factors besides those listed may also adversely affect the Company and may be material to the Company. The Company has listed the known material risks it considers relevant in evaluating the Company and its operations. The forward-looking statements in this document are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof based on management\u2019s current expectations, and the Company does not undertake an obligation to update such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, other than as required by law.\nFor a discussion identifying some important factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, see the factors listed below, along with the discussion of \u201cCompetition\u201d under Item 1 of this Form 10-K, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under Item 7 of this Form 10-K, and \u201cNote A: Accounting Policies\u201d and \u201cNote O: Commitments and Contingencies\u201d of the \u201cNotes to Financial Statements\u201d of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplemental Data,\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nForm 10-K \u2666 Page 12\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\nPart I \u2666 Item 1A - Risk Factors\nIndustry and COVID-19 Risk Factors\nOur business is cyclical and depends on activity within the construction industry\nEconomic and political uncertainty can impede growth in the markets in which we operate. Demand for our products, particularly in the private nonresidential and residential construction markets, could decline if companies and consumers are unable to obtain credit for construction projects or if an economic slowdown causes delays or cancellations of capital projects. State and federal budget issues may also hurt the funding available for infrastructure spending. The lack of available credit may limit the ability of states to issue bonds to finance construction projects. As a result of these issues, several of our top revenue-generating states, from time to time, stop bidding or slow bid projects in their transportation departments.\nWe sell most of our aggregates (our primary business) and our cement products to the construction industry and, therefore, our results depend on that industry\u2019s strength. Since our businesses depend on construction spending, which can be cyclical, our profits are sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions and the intensity of the underlying spending on aggregates and cement products. Construction spending is affected by economic conditions, changes in interest rates, demographic and population shifts, and changes in construction spending by federal, state and local governments. If economic conditions change, a recession in the construction industry may occur and affect the demand for our products. The recession of the late 2000s and early 2010s (the Great Recession) was an example, and our shipment volumes were significantly reduced. Construction spending can also be disrupted by terrorist activity and armed conflicts.\nWhile our business operations cover a wide geographic area, our earnings depend on the strength of the local economies in which we operate because of the high cost to transport our products relative to their selling price. If economic conditions and construction spending decline significantly in one or more areas, particularly in the Building Materials business\u2019 top five revenue-generating states of Texas, Colorado, North Carolina, Georgia and Minnesota, our profitability will decrease. We experienced this situation during the Great Recession.\nThe Great Recession resulted in large declines in shipments of aggregates products in our industry. Subsequent to the Great Recession and until the impact from COVID-19 beginning in the first quarter of 2020, we experienced slow-but-steady construction growth that coincided with the longest economic recovery in United States history.\nWhile historical spending on public infrastructure projects has been, comparatively, more stable as governmental appropriations and expenditures are typically less interest rate-sensitive than private sector spending, we experienced a slight retraction in aggregates shipments to the infrastructure market after uncertainty regarding the passage of the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014. Contractors were not able to get any certainty on the availability of federal infrastructure funding until late 2015 with the enactment of the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act. We expect that the passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (the IIJ Act) should provide funding visibility for the foreseeable future.\nOur Building Materials business is seasonal and subject to the weather, which can significantly impact operations\nSince the heavy-side construction business is conducted outdoors, erratic weather patterns, seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions affect our business. Adverse weather conditions, including hurricanes and tropical storms, cold weather, snow, heavy or sustained rainfall, wildfires and earthquakes, reduce construction activity, restrict the demand for our products and impede our ability to efficiently transport material. Adverse weather conditions also increase our costs and reduce our production output as a result of power loss, needed plant and equipment repairs, time required to remove water from flooded operations and similar events. Severe drought conditions can restrict available water supplies and restrict production. Production and shipment levels of the Building Materials business\u2019 products follow activity in the construction industry, which typically are strongest in the spring, summer and fall. Because of the weather\u2019s effect on the construction industry\u2019s activity, the production and shipment levels for the Company\u2019s Building Materials business, including all of its aggregates-related downstream operations, vary by quarter. The second and third quarters are generally subject to heavy precipitation, and thus are more profitable if precipitation is lighter, while the first and fourth quarters are subject to the impacts of winter weather, and thus are generally the least profitable and are more profitable if the impact of winter weather is less. The Company\u2019s operations in the southeastern and Gulf Coast regions of the United States and The Bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity, most notably in August, September and October. The Company\u2019s California operations are at risk for wildfire activity and water use restrictions given ongoing severe drought conditions.\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\nForm 10-K \u2666 Page 13\nPart I \u2666 Item 1A - Risk Factors\nOur businesses could be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or any other outbreak of disease, epidemic or pandemic, or similar public health threat, or fear of such an event and its related economic and societal response\nOur businesses could be negatively impacted by the widespread outbreak of an illness or other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis that results in economic and trade disruptions. In or around December 2019, COVID-19 was initially reported. Four months later, in March 2020, the World Health Organization declared it a global pandemic. The proliferation of COVID-19 cases in the United States, and the extent that geography of outbreaks primarily matches the regions in which the Company\u2019s Building Materials business principally operates, can negatively impact economic activity, consumer confidence and discretionary spending, and overall market conditions. Further, COVID-19 could continue to negatively affect the health of our employees, employee productivity, customer purchasing patterns and fulfillment of purchase orders, availability of supplies, pricing for raw materials, and the ability to transport materials via the Company\u2019s distribution network. While our operations have been designated as \u201cessential\u201d under applicable government orders otherwise restricting business activities to prevent further outbreak of COVID-19, and accordingly have been permitted to continue to operate, the Company continues to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter its business operations including any that may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that the Company determines are in the best interests of its employees, customers, suppliers, vendors, communities and other stakeholders. Demand for aggregates products, particularly in the infrastructure construction market, is affected by federal, state and local budget and deficit issues. Remote working trends are reducing miles driven, which can have a negative impact on various revenue streams that fund roadway projects. Further, delays or cancellations of projects in the nonresidential and residential construction markets, which combined accounted for 61% of aggregates shipments for the year ended December 31, 2021, could occur if companies and consumers are unable to obtain financing for construction projects or if consumer confidence continues to be eroded by economic uncertainty.\nCompetition and Growth Risk Factors\nOur Building Materials business depends on the availability of quality aggregates reserves or deposits and our ability to mine them economically\nOur challenge is to find quality aggregates deposits that we can mine economically, with appropriate permits, near either growing markets or long-haul transportation corridors that economically serve applicable markets. As communities have grown, they have settled in and around attractive quarrying locations and have imposed restrictions on mining. We try to meet this challenge by identifying and permitting sites prior to economic expansion, buying more land around our existing quarries to increase our mineral reserves, developing underground mines and developing a distribution network that transports aggregates products by various methods, including rail and water. While our distribution network allows us to transport our products longer distances than would normally be considered economical, we can give no assurances that we will be successful at this strategy.\nOur businesses face many competitors\nOur businesses have many competitors, some of whom are bigger and have more resources than we do. Some of our competitors operate on a worldwide basis. Our results are affected by the number of competitors in a market, the production capacity that a particular market can accommodate, the pricing practices of other competitors and the entry of new competitors in a market. We also face competition for some of our products from alternative products. For example, our Magnesia Specialties business may compete with other chemical products that could be used instead of our magnesia-based products. As other examples, our aggregates, ready mixed concrete, and asphalt and paving businesses may compete with recycled asphalt and concrete products that could be used in certain applications instead of new products and our cement operations may compete with international competitors who are importing products into the United States from jurisdictions with lower production and regulatory costs.\nOur future growth may depend in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry, and we may acquire businesses by paying all or in part with shares of our common stock\nWe expect to continue to grow, in part, by acquiring other businesses. In the past, we have made acquisitions to strengthen our existing locations, expand our operations and enter new geographic markets. We will continue to pursue selective acquisitions, joint ventures or other business arrangements we believe will help our Company grow. However, the continued\nForm 10-K \u2666 Page 14\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\nPart I \u2666 Item 1A - Risk Factors\nsuccess of our acquisition program will depend on our ability to find and buy other attractive businesses at an appropriate price and our ability to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations. We cannot assume there will continue to be attractive acquisition opportunities for sale at reasonable prices that we can successfully integrate into our operations.\nWe may decide to pay all or part of the purchase price of any future acquisition with shares of our common stock. We may also use our stock to make strategic investments in other companies to complement and expand our operations. If we use our common stock in this way, the ownership interests of our existing shareholders at that time will be diluted and the price of our stock could decline. We operate our businesses with the objective of maximizing long-term shareholder return.\nOur integration of the acquisition or business combination with other businesses may not be as successful as projected\nWe have a successful history of business combinations and integration of these businesses into our heritage operations. However, in connection with the integration of any other business that we acquire, there is a risk that we will not be able to achieve such integration in a successful manner or on the time schedule we have projected or in a way that will achieve the level of synergies, cost savings or operating efficiencies we forecast from the acquisition.\nAny other significant business acquisition or combination we might choose to undertake may require that we devote significant management attention and resources to preparing for and then integrating our business practices and operations. Based on our history, we believe we would be successful in this integration process. Nevertheless, we may fail to realize some of the anticipated benefits of any potential acquisition or other business combination that we pursue in the future if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected. Potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include:\n\u2022\nthe inability to successfully combine operations in a manner that permits us to achieve the cost savings and revenue synergies anticipated to result from the proposed acquisition or business combination, which would result in the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or business combination not being realized partly or wholly in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;\n\u2022\nlost sales and customers as a result of certain customers of either the Company or former customers of the acquired or combined company deciding not to do business with the Company;\n\u2022\ncomplexities associated with managing the combined operations;\n\u2022\nintegrating personnel;\n\u2022\ncreation of uniform standards, internal controls, procedures, policies and information systems;\n\u2022\ndiscovery of previously unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory issues associated with integrating the remaining operations; and\n\u2022\nperformance shortfalls at business units as a result of the diversion of management attention caused by completing the remaining integration of the operations.\nOur acquisitions could harm our results of operations\nIn pursuing our business strategy, we conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities and enter into acquisition agreements. Acquisitions involve significant challenges and risks, including risks that:\n\u2022\nwe may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to retain key personnel of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nwe may experience difficulty in integrating new employees, business systems and technology;\n\u2022\nour due diligence process may not identify compliance issues or other liabilities that are in existence at the time of our acquisition;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to bring the acquired business up to our expected levels of safety standards as soon as anticipated;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty entering into new geographic markets in which we are not experienced; or\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to retain the customers and partners of acquired businesses following the acquisition.\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\nForm 10-K \u2666 Page 15\nPart I \u2666 Item 1A - Risk Factors\nOur cement and Magnesia Specialties businesses may become capacity-constrained\nIf our cement or Magnesia Specialties businesses becomes capacity-constrained, we may be unable to timely satisfy the demand for some of our products, and any resulting changes in customers would introduce volatility to the earnings of these segments. We can address capacity needs by enhancing our manufacturing productivity, increasing the operational availability of equipment, reducing machinery down time and extending machinery useful life. Future demand for our products may require us to expand our manufacturing capacity further, particularly through the purchase of additional manufacturing equipment. However, we may not be able to increase our capacity in time to satisfy increases in demand that may occur from time to time. Capacity constraints may prevent us from satisfying customer orders and result in a loss of sales to competitors that are not capacity-constrained. In addition, we may suffer excess capacity if we increase our capacity to meet actual or anticipated demand and that demand decreases or does not materialize. While we are permitted to expand production by up to 0.8 million additional tons at our Midlothian cement plant, it could take us a significant period of time before such production expansion could come to fruition.\nOur cement business could suffer if cement imports from other countries significantly increase or are sold in the United States in violation of U.S. fair trade laws\nIn the past, the cement industry has obtained antidumping orders imposing duties on imports of cement and clinker from other countries that violated U.S. fair trade laws. Currently, an antidumping order against cement and clinker from Japan is set to expire but is under review for extension by the Federal Trade Commission. As has always been the case, cement operators with import facilities can purchase cement from other countries, such as those in Latin America and Asia, which could compete with domestic producers. In addition, if environmental regulations increase the costs of domestic producers compared to foreign producers that are not subject to similar regulations, imported cement could achieve a significant cost advantage over domestically produced cement. An influx of cement or clinker products from countries not subject to antidumping orders, or sales of imported cement or clinker in violation of U.S. fair trade laws, could adversely affect our cement product line.\nEconomic, Political and Legal Risk Factors\nChanges in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning, land use, the environment, health and safety and other areas of the law, as well as litigation relating to these matters, affect our businesses. Our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities\nMany federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning, land use, air emissions (including carbon dioxide and other GHGs), water use, allocation and discharges, waste management, noise and dust control, mining, land reclamation and other environmental, health and safety matters govern our operations. Some of our operations require permits, which may impose additional operating standards, and are subject to modification, renewal and revocation. Certain of our operations may from time to time involve the use of substances that are classified as toxic or hazardous within the meaning of these laws and regulations. Despite our extensive efforts to remain in strict compliance at all times with all applicable laws and regulations, the risk of liabilities, particularly environmental liabilities, is inherent in the operation of our businesses. These potential liabilities could result in material costs, including fines or personal injury or damages claims, which could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability.\nFuture events, including changes in existing laws or regulations or enforcement policies, or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of some of our products or business activities may result in additional or unanticipated compliance and other costs. We could be required to invest in preventive or remedial action, like pollution control facilities, which could be substantial or which could result in restrictions on our operations or delays in obtaining required permits or other approvals.\nOur operations are subject to manufacturing, operating and handling risks associated with the products we produce and the products we use in our operations, including the related storage and transportation of raw materials, explosives, products, hazardous substances and wastes. We are exposed to hazards including storage tank leaks, explosions, discharges or releases of hazardous substances, exposure to dust, and the operation of mobile equipment and manufacturing machinery.\nThese risks can subject us to potentially significant liabilities relating to personal injury or death, or property damage, and may result in civil or criminal penalties, which could hurt our productivity or profitability. For example, from time to time we investigate and remediate environmental contamination relating to our prior or current operations, as well as operations we\nForm 10-K \u2666 Page 16\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\nPart I \u2666 Item 1A - Risk Factors\nhave acquired from others, and in some cases we have been or could be named as a defendant in litigation brought by governmental agencies or private parties to investigate or clean-up such contamination.\nWe are involved from time to time in litigation and claims arising from our operations. While we do not believe the outcome of pending or threatened litigation will have a material adverse effect on our operations or our financial condition, an unexpected and material adverse outcome in a pending or future legal action could potentially have a negative effect on our Company.\nClimate change and related legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business, including potential physical and financial impacts\nA number of governmental bodies, including the U.S. Congress and various U.S. states, have proposed, enacted or are contemplating legislative and regulatory changes to mitigate or address the potential impacts of climate change, including provisions for GHG emissions reductions or the use of alternative fuels, carbon credits (such as a \"cap and trade\" system) and a carbon tax. For example, in the United States, the USEPA promulgated a mandatory reporting rule covering GHG emissions from sources considered to be large emitters. The USEPA has also promulgated a GHG emissions permitting rule, referred to as the Tailoring Rule, which may require some industrial facilities to obtain operating permits for GHG emissions under the U.S. Clean Air Act. Although the U.S. Supreme Court subsequently ruled in June 2014 that the USEPA exceeded its statutory authority in issuing the Tailoring Rule but upheld the BACT requirements for GHGs emitted by sources that already require Title V operating permits or are subject to PSD requirements for other pollutants. With the change of the U.S. presidential administration in 2021, it is currently unclear whether the USEPA will proceed with revisions of the Tailoring Rule or proceed in a different direction, nor is it known how the USEPA may revise the BACT requirements. If future modifications to our Magnesia Specialties or cement facilities require PSD review for other pollutants, GHG permitting requirements may also be triggered, which could require us to incur significant additional costs. It is not possible, however, to estimate the cost of any future requirements at this time.\nU.S. President Biden also has taken a number of steps to make climate change a central focus of his administration, including issuing a pair of executive orders and a presidential memorandum making climate change central to U.S. Policy and setting out several administrative priorities and undertakings. President Biden reentered the Paris Agreement in January 2021 and later announced the United States\u2019 reduction commitments under the Paris Agreement, including a 50% to 52% economy-wide reduction in net GHG emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. More recently, President Biden set out a pact with 103 countries and jurisdictions, known as the Global Methane Pledge, to reduce global methane emissions by 30% from 2020 levels by the end of the decade. In November 2021, President signed into law the IIJ Act, which provides billions of dollars in new funding for public transit and clean energy projects intended, in part, to address climate change, including road, bridge and other major infrastructure projects. In addition, the currently-proposed Build Back Better bill calls for significant U.S. government investments in the commercialization and scale-up of energy and climate technologies, as well as tax credits for businesses that invest in clean energy. Although it is still too early to determine the actions the federal government will ultimately take to implement these orders, commitments and laws, or the full scope, timing or ramifications of such measures, it is clear that the administration intends and has begun to make a significant and sweeping push on the climate front and, like other signatories to the Paris Agreement, intends to pursue a goal of a Net Zero GHG by 2050. These measures, combined with Democratic control of both chambers of the U.S. Congress, also suggest that additional executive and/or legislative action is likely, although the timing and scope of such action is unclear. Additionally, it seems probable that the USEPA and other agencies will use their rule-making authority and procurement decisions to further address climate change. Various states where we have operations have enacted or are considering climate change initiatives as well, and we may be subject to state regulations in addition to any federal laws and rules that are passed. For example, California has had a cap-and-trade program for emissions rights since 2012. In light of the various regulatory uncertainties, we cannot at this time reasonably predict what the costs of any future compliance requirements may be, but we do not believe it will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of the operations of either the Magnesia Specialties business or Building Materials business. We continue to monitor GHG regulations and legislation and its potential impact on our cement business, financial condition and product demand.\nAlthough our aggregates, ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations are not so-called \u201cmajor\u201d sources of GHG emissions subject to the USEPA reporting rule, any additional regulatory restrictions on emissions of GHGs imposed by the USEPA will likely impact our magnesia-based chemicals operations in Woodville, Ohio, and Manistee, Michigan, as well as our two cement plants in Texas and our two cement plants in California, each of which currently file annual reports of GHG emissions as required by the USEPA reporting rule. However, it is currently impossible to estimate the cost of any such future requirements at this time. In addition, we may not be able to recover any increased operating costs, taxes or capital investments (other than with respect to any carbon reduction or capture technologies) relating to GHG emission limitations at those plants from our customers in order to remain competitive in pricing in the relevant markets.\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\nForm 10-K \u2666 Page 17\nPart I \u2666 Item 1A - Risk Factors\nIn addition to impacts from increased GHG and other climate-related regulation, climate change may result in physical and financial impacts that could have adverse effects on our operations or financial condition. Given the nature of our operations, physical impacts may include disruptions in production and/or regional supply or product distribution networks due to major storm events, shifts in regional rainfall and temperature patterns and intensities, as well as flooding from sea level changes. In addition, production and shipment levels for the Building Materials business correlate with general construction activity, most of which occurs outdoors and, as a result, is affected by erratic weather patterns, seasonal changes and other unusual or unexpected weather-related conditions, which can significantly affect that business. Excessive rainfall and other severe weather events also jeopardize production, shipments and profitability in all markets served by our operations. In particular, our operations in the southeastern and Gulf Coast regions of the United States and The Bahamas are at risk for hurricane activity, most notably in August, September and October. In addition, our California operations are at risk for wildfires, which is exacerbated by prolonged drought, which may also result in water restrictions. Increased intensity and frequency of extreme weather events have been linked to climate change, and further global warming may increase the risk of adverse weather conditions. Climate and inclement weather can also reduce the useful life of an asset.\nOur businesses also are dependent on reliable sources of electricity and fuels. We could incur increased costs or disruptions in our operations if climate change legislation and regulation or severe weather impacts the price or availability of purchased electricity or fuels or other materials used in our operations. These and other climate-related risks, such as a downturn in the construction sector due to harsh weather, high precipitation or other changes in weather, could impact our customers, which could lead to reduced demand for our products. We may not be able to pass on to our customers all the costs related to mitigating these risks.\nThe overall impacts of climate change on our operations and the Company are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate. However, climate change legislation and regulation concerning GHGs could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur business is dependent on funding from a combination of federal, state and local sources\nOur products are used in public infrastructure projects, which include the construction, maintenance and improvement of highways, streets, roads, bridges, schools and similar projects. Accordingly, our business is dependent on the level of federal, state, and local spending on these projects. The visibility into future federal infrastructure funding was clarified and stabilized to some extent in 2015 with the passage of the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation, or FAST Act, which reauthorized federal highway and transportation funding programs. Further clarification was provided with the passage of the $1 trillion IIJ Act in November 2021, which contains a five-year surface transportation reauthorization plus $110 billion in new funding for roads, bridges and other hard infrastructure projects. At the federal level, we expect to see stable infrastructure spending in 2022, with more meaningful impact from the IIJ Act beginning in 2023. Further, we continue to expect to see increased infrastructure spending at the state and local levels in 2022, aided by $10 billion for state departments of transportation provided by the December 2020 federal stimulus package as well as $14 billion of approved ballot initiatives. We cannot be assured, however, of the amount and timing of appropriations for spending on infrastructure projects.\nOur businesses could be impacted by rising interest rates\nOur operations are highly dependent upon the interest rate-sensitive construction and steelmaking industries. Therefore, our business in these industries may decline if interest rates rise and costs increase.\nNotably, demand in the residential construction market in which we sell our aggregates products is affected by interest rates which are currently at historically low levels. There can be no assurance, however, that interest rates will not increase in the future, affecting our business in an adverse manner. The residential construction market accounted for 25% of our organic aggregates shipments in 2021.\nAside from these inherent risks from within our operations, our earnings are also affected by changes in short-term interest rates. However, rising interest rates are not necessarily predictive of weaker operating results.\nRising interest rates could also result in disruptions in the credit markets, which could affect our business, as described in greater detail under \u201cDisruptions in the credit markets could affect our business\u201d below.\nForm 10-K \u2666 Page 18\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\nPart I \u2666 Item 1A - Risk Factors\nIncreases in our effective income tax rate may harm our results of operations\nA number of factors may increase our future effective income tax rate, including:\n\u2022\ngovernmental authorities increasing taxes or eliminating deductions, particularly the depletion deduction;\n\u2022\nthe mix of earnings from depletable versus non-depletable businesses;\n\u2022\nthe jurisdictions in which earnings are taxed;\n\u2022\nthe resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nadjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;\n\u2022\nchanges in available tax credits;\n\u2022\nchanges in stock-based compensation;\n\u2022\nother changes in tax laws; and\n\u2022\nthe interpretation of tax laws and/or administrative practices.\nAny significant increase in our future effective income tax rate could reduce net earnings and free cash flow for future periods.\nPersonnel Risks\nLabor disputes could disrupt operations of our businesses\nLabor unions represent approximately 14% of the hourly employees of our Building Materials business and all of the hourly employees of our Magnesia Specialties business. Our collective bargaining agreements for employees of our Magnesia Specialties business at the Woodville, Ohio, lime plant and the Manistee, Michigan magnesia chemicals plant expire in and June 2022 and August 2027, respectively.\nDisputes with our trade unions, or the inability to renew our labor agreements, could lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our businesses, raise costs and reduce revenues and earnings from the affected locations.\nWe depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel, and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued services of, and on our ability to attract and retain, our key personnel and executive officers, including qualified management, technical, marketing and sales, and support personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining such qualified personnel, which could negatively affect our business. In addition, because of our reliance on our senior management team, the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and develop or recruit talent to succeed our senior management and other key positions throughout the organization. If we fail to identify and develop or recruit successors, we are at risk of being harmed by the departures of these key employees. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.\nInvestment returns on our pension assets may be lower than expected, or interest rates may decline, requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our benefit plans.\nA portion of our current and former employees have accrued benefits under our defined benefit pension plans. Requirements for funding our pension plan liabilities are based on a number of actuarial assumptions, including the expected rate of return on our plan assets and the discount rate applied to our pension plan obligations. Fluctuations in equity market returns and changes in long-term interest rates could increase our costs under our defined benefit pension plans and may significantly affect future contribution requirements. It is unknown what the actual investment return on our pension assets will be in future years and what interest rates may be at any given point in time. We cannot therefore provide any assurance of what our actual pension plan costs will be in the future, or whether we will be required under applicable law to make future material plan contributions.\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\nForm 10-K \u2666 Page 19\nPart I \u2666 Item 1A - Risk Factors\nFinancial, Accounting and Cost Management Risk Factors\nOur business is a capital-intensive business\nThe property and machinery needed to produce our products are very expensive. Therefore, we require large amounts of cash to operate our businesses. We believe that our cash on hand, along with our projected operating cash flows and our available financing resources, is adequate to support our anticipated operating and capital needs. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow depends on future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash to operate our business, we may be required, among other things, to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures.\nOur earnings are affected by the application of accounting standards and our critical accounting policies, which involve subjective judgments and estimates by our management. Our estimates and assumptions could be wrong\nThe accounting standards we use in preparing our financial statements are often complex and require that we make significant estimates and assumptions in interpreting and applying those standards. These estimates and assumptions involve matters that are inherently uncertain and require our subjective and complex judgments. If we used different estimates and assumptions or used different ways to determine these estimates, our financial results could differ.\nWhile we believe our estimates and assumptions are appropriate, we could be wrong. Accordingly, our financial results could be different, either higher or lower. We urge you to read the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section included under Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d of the Form 10-K.\nThe adoption of new accounting standards may affect our financial results\nThe accounting standards we apply in preparing our financial statements are reviewed by regulatory bodies and are periodically changed. New or revised accounting standards could, either positively or negatively, affect results reported for periods after adoption of the standards as compared to the prior periods, or require retrospective application changing results reported for prior periods. We urge you to read about our accounting policies in Note A: Accounting Policies of our Consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nReports from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\u2019s (PCAOB) inspections of public accounting firms continue to outline findings and recommendations which could require these firms to perform additional work as part of their financial statement audits. Our costs to respond to these additional requirements may increase.\nImpairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results\nGoodwill and other acquired intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows are not amortized, but must be evaluated for impairment by management at least annually. If the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, the goodwill is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a non-cash charge to earnings. If the carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its fair value, the intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value via a non-cash charge to earnings. Future events may occur that would adversely affect the fair value of our goodwill or other acquired intangible assets and require impairment charges. Such events may include, but are not limited to, lower than forecasted revenues, actual new construction and repair and remodel growth rates that fall below our assumptions, actions of key customers, increases in discount rates, continued economic uncertainty, higher levels of unemployment, weak consumer confidence, lower levels of discretionary consumer spending, a decrease in royalty rates and a decline in the trading price of our common stock. We continue to evaluate the impact of economic and other developments to assess whether impairment indicators are present. Accordingly, we may be required to perform impairment tests based on changes in the economic environment and other factors, and these tests could result in impairment charges in the future.\nDisruptions in the credit markets could affect our business\nWe have considered the current economic environment and its potential impact to our business. Demand for aggregates products, particularly in the infrastructure construction market, have historically been negatively affected by federal and state budget challenges and the uncertainty over future highway funding levels. Further, delays or cancellations to capital\nForm 10-K \u2666 Page 20\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\nPart I \u2666 Item 1A - Risk Factors\nprojects in the nonresidential and residential construction markets could occur if companies and consumers are unable to obtain financing for construction projects or if consumer confidence is eroded by economic uncertainty.\nA recessionary construction economy can also increase the likelihood we will not be able to collect on all of our accounts receivable with our customers. We are protected in part, however, by payment bonds posted by many of our customers or end-users as well as state lien rights. Nevertheless, we may experience a delay in payment from some of our customers during a construction downturn, which would negatively affect operating cash flows. Historically, our bad debt write-offs have not been significant to our operating results, and we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate.\nThe credit environment could impact our ability to borrow money in the future. Additional financing or refinancing might not be available and, if available, may not be at economically favorable terms. Further, an increase in leverage could lead to deterioration in our credit ratings. A reduction in our credit ratings, regardless of the cause, could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing and/or increase our cost of obtaining financing. There is no guarantee we will be able to access the capital markets at financially economical interest rates, which could negatively affect our business.\nWe may be required to obtain financing in order to fund certain strategic acquisitions, if they arise, or to refinance our outstanding debt. It is possible a large strategic acquisition would require that we issue new equity and debt securities in order to maintain our investment-grade credit rating and could result in a ratings downgrade notwithstanding our issuance of equity securities to fund the transaction. We are also exposed to risks from tightening credit markets, through the interest payable on any variable-rate debt, including the interest cost on future borrowings under our credit facilities. While management believes our credit ratings will remain at a composite investment-grade level, we cannot be assured these ratings will remain at those levels. Also, while we believe the Company will continue to have adequate credit available to meet its needs, there can be no assurance of that.\nOur Magnesia Specialties business faces currency risks from its overseas activities\nOur Magnesia Specialties business sells some of its products outside the United States. Therefore, the operations of the Magnesia Specialties business are affected from time to time by the fluctuating values of the currency exchange rates of the countries in which it does business in relation to the value of the U.S. Dollar. The business tries to mitigate the short-term effects of currency exchange rates by primarily denominating sales in the U.S. Dollar. This still leaves the business subject to certain risks, depending on the strength of the U.S. Dollar.\nUnexpected equipment failures, catastrophic events and scheduled maintenance may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns\nOur manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of equipment, such as our kilns and finishing mills. This equipment, on occasion, may be out of service as a result of planned maintenance, failures or damage during accidents. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or violent weather conditions. We have one- to two-week scheduled outages at least once a year to refurbish our cement and dolomitic lime production facilities. In 2021, the cement and Magnesia Specialties operations incurred shutdown costs of $23.6 million and $5.5 million, respectively. Any significant interruption in production capability may require us to make significant capital expenditures to remedy problems or damage as well as cause us to lose revenue due to lost production time.\nOur paving operations present additional risks to our business\nOur paving operations face challenges when our contracts have penalties for late completion. In some instances, including many of our fixed-price contracts, we guarantee project completion by a certain date. If we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled, we may be held responsible for costs resulting from the delay, generally in the form of contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages. Under these circumstances, the total project cost could exceed our original estimate, and we could experience a loss of profit or a loss on the project. In our paving operations, we also have fixed-price and fixed-unit-price contracts where our profits can be adversely affected by a number of factors beyond our control, which can cause our actual costs to materially exceed the costs estimated at the time of our original bid. These same issues and risks can also impact some of our contracts in our asphalt and ready mixed concrete operations. These risks are somewhat mitigated by the fact that a majority of our road paving contracts are projects that are short in duration.\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\nForm 10-K \u2666 Page 21\nPart I \u2666 Item 1A - Risk Factors\nOur ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving product lines have lower profit margins and operating results can be more volatile\nOur ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations typically generate lower profit margins than our aggregates and cement operations due to potentially volatile input costs, highly competitive market dynamics, and lower barriers to entry. Therefore, if we expand these operations, our consolidated gross margin would likely be adversely affected. Our overall ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations\u2019 gross margin was 10.5% for 2021 and 10.9% for 2020.\nSuppliers, Raw Materials, and Energy Costs Risk Factors\nShort supplies and high costs of fuel, energy and raw materials affect our businesses\nOur businesses require a continued supply of diesel fuel, natural gas, coal, petroleum coke and other energy. The financial results of these businesses have historically been affected by the short supply or high costs of these fuels and energy. Changes in energy costs also affect the prices that we pay for related supplies, including explosives, conveyor belting and tires. While we can contract for some fuels and sources of energy, such as fixed-price supply contracts for coal and petroleum coke, significant increases in costs or reduced availability of these items have and may in the future reduce our financial results. Moreover, fluctuations in the supply and costs of these fuels and energy can make planning for our businesses more difficult. Because of the fluctuating trends in diesel fuel prices, we may enter into fixed-price fuel agreements from time to time for a portion of our diesel fuel to reduce our diesel fuel price risk.\nOur Magnesia Specialties business has fixed-price agreements for approximately 64% of its 2022 coal, natural gas, and petroleum coke needs. The cement operations have fixed-price agreements for a portion of their 2022 coal and natural gas needs.\nCement production requires large amounts of energy, including electricity and fossil fuels. Energy costs represented approximately 23% of the 2021 direct production costs of our cement operations. Therefore, the cost of energy is one of our largest expenses. Prices for energy are subject to market forces largely beyond our control and can be quite volatile. Price increases that we are unable to pass through in the form of price increases for our products, or disruption of the uninterrupted supply of fuel and electricity, could adversely affect us. Accordingly, volatility in energy costs can adversely affect the financial results of our cement operations.\nSimilarly, our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations also require a continued supply of liquid asphalt and cement, which serve as key raw materials in the production of hot mix asphalt and ready mixed concrete, respectively. Some of these raw materials we produce internally, but most are purchased from third parties. These purchased raw materials are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuations, which are beyond our control. The financial results of our ready mixed concrete and asphalt and paving operations have been affected by the short supply or high costs of these raw materials. We generally see frequent volatility in the costs for these raw materials.\nCement is sensitive to supply and price volatility\nCement competition is often based primarily on price, which is highly sensitive to changes in supply and demand. Prices may fluctuate significantly in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand, general economic conditions and other market conditions, which we cannot control. When cement producers increase production capacity or more cement is imported into the market, an oversupply of cement in the market may occur if supply exceeds demand. In that case, cement prices generally decline. We cannot be assured that prices for our cement products sold will not decline in the future or that such decline will not have a material adverse effect on our cement product line.\nOur Magnesia Specialties business depends in part on the steel industry and the supply of reasonably priced fuels\nOur Magnesia Specialties business sells some of its products to companies in the steel industry. While we have reduced this risk over the last few years, this business is still dependent, in part, on the strength of the cyclical steel industry. The Magnesia Specialties business also requires significant amounts of natural gas, coal and petroleum coke, and financial results are negatively affected by increases in fuel prices or shortages.\nForm 10-K \u2666 Page 22\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\nPart I \u2666 Item 1A - Risk Factors\nCyber and Information Security Risk Factors\nWe are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks\nThe Company\u2019s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive, proprietary and other types of information relating to its business operations, as well as confidential and sensitive information about its customers and employees maintained in the Company\u2019s computer systems and networks, certain products and services and in the computer systems and networks of its third-party vendors. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving as data thieves and hackers have become increasingly sophisticated and carry out direct large-scale, complex automated attacks against a company or through vendor software supply chain compromises. In particular, the Company is increasingly relying on its IT infrastructure to support its operations as it manages the impact of COVID-19, including supporting remote-work protocols in regions impacted by the spread of COVID-19, which can increase cyber risks. The Company is not able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any resulting material security breach or data loss. In addition, it is not always possible to deter misconduct by employees or third-party vendors.\nBreaches of the Company\u2019s technology systems, or those of the Company\u2019s vendors and customers, whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, \u201cphishing\u201d attacks, computer viruses, ransomware or malware, employee or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, vendor software supply chain compromises, physical breaches or other actions, have and may result in manipulation or corruption of sensitive data, material interruptions or malfunctions in the Company\u2019s or such vendors\u2019 and customers\u2019 websites, applications, data processing and certain products and services, or disruption of other business operations. Furthermore, any such breaches could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information held by the Company (including information about the Company\u2019s business, employees or customers), as well as sensitive personally identifiable information, the disclosure of which could lead to identity theft. Breaches of the Company\u2019s products that rely on technology and internet connectivity can expose the Company to product and other liability risk and reputational harm. Measures that the Company takes to avoid, detect, mitigate or recover from material incidents, may be insufficient, circumvented, or may become ineffective.\nThe Company has invested and continues to invest in risk management and information security and data privacy measures in order to protect its systems and data, including employee training, organizational investments, incident response plans, table top exercises and technical defenses. The cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense, complex and sophisticated global cyber threats. Despite the Company\u2019s best efforts, it is not fully insulated from data breaches and system disruptions. Recent well-publicized security breaches at other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyber-attacks, and may in the future result in heightened cybersecurity requirements, including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of vendors and service providers. Any material breaches of cybersecurity, including the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data, or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to the Company\u2019s systems, products and services or those of the Company\u2019s third parties could cause the Company to experience reputational harm, loss of customers and revenue, fines, regulatory actions and scrutiny, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation, liability for failure to safeguard the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 information or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the Company. The report, rumor or assumption regarding a potential breach may have similar results, even if no breach has been attempted or occurred. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company is exposed to risks related to compliance with data privacy laws\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which came into effect in January 2020, provides, among other things, a new private right of action for data breaches, requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, and provides consumers with additional rights. The California Privacy Rights and Enforcement Act, which will become effective on January 1, 2023, amends and expands the CCPA, creating new industry requirements, consumer privacy rights and enforcement mechanisms. Similarly, to conduct certain of its operations, the Company moves data across national borders, and consequently is subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the United States and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security. The scope of the laws that may be applicable to the Company is often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\nForm 10-K \u2666 Page 23\nPart I \u2666 Item 1A - Risk Factors\n(GDPR), which became effective in May 2018, greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of European Union law and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches. The Company's reputation and brand and its ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if the Company fails, or is perceived to have failed, to properly respond to security breaches of its or third party\u2019s information technology systems. Such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability.\nAll of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time. Privacy laws that may be implemented in the future will continue to require changes to certain business practices, thereby increasing costs, or may result in negative publicity, require significant management time and attention, and may subject the Company to remedies that may harm its business, including fines or demands or orders that the Company modify or cease existing business practices.\nOther Risk Factors\nDelays or interruptions in shipping products of our businesses could affect our operations\nTransportation logistics play an important role in allowing us to supply products to our customers, whether by truck, rail or water. We also rely heavily on third-party truck and rail transportation to ship coal, natural gas and other fuels to our plants. Any significant delays, disruptions or the non-availability of our transportation support system could negatively affect our operations. Transportation operations are subject to capacity constraints, high fuel costs and various hazards, including extreme weather conditions and slowdowns due to labor strikes and other work stoppages. In Texas, we compete for third-party trucking services with operations in the oil and gas fields, which can significantly constrain the availability of those services to us. If there are material changes in the availability or cost of transportation services, we may not be able to arrange alternative and timely means to transport our products or fuels at a reasonable cost, which could lead to interruptions or slowdowns in our businesses or increases in our costs.\nThe availability of railcars can also affect our ability to transport our products. Railcars can be used to transport many different types of products across all of our segments. If owners sell or lease railcars for use in other industries, we may not have enough railcars to transport our products.\nWe have long-term agreements with shipping companies to provide ships to transport our aggregates products from our Bahamas and Nova Scotia operations to various coastal ports. These contracts have varying expiration dates ranging from 2023 to 2027 and generally contain renewal options. Our inability to renew these agreements or enter into new ones with other shipping companies could affect our ability to transport our products.\nSome of our products are distributed by barges along rivers in Ohio and West Virginia. We may experience, to a lesser degree, risks associated with distributing our products by barges, including significant delays, disruptions or the non-availability of our barge transportation system that could negatively affect our operations, water levels that could affect our ability to transport our products by barge, and barges that may not be available in quantities that we might need from time to time to support our operations.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws and North Carolina law may inhibit a change in control that you may favor\nOur restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws and North Carolina law contain provisions that may delay, deter or inhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our Board of Directors. This could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if many or even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest. These provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our Board of Directors in connection with the transaction. Provisions that could delay, deter, or inhibit a future acquisition include the following:\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Board of Directors to establish the terms of, and issue, preferred stock without shareholder approval;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that our shareholders may only remove directors for cause;\n\u2022\nthe inability of shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders; and\n\u2022\nsuper-majority shareholder approval requirements for business combination transactions with certain five percent shareholders.\nForm 10-K \u2666 Page 24\nSOAR to a Sustainable Future\nPart I \u2666 Item 1A - Risk Factors\nAdditionally, the occurrence of certain change-of-control events could result in an event of default under certain of our existing or future debt instruments.", "PERMNO": 80204, "SIC": 1400, "TIC": "MLM"}
