{"cik": "821127", "company": "BOSTON PRIVATE FINANCIAL HOLDINGS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nBefore deciding to invest in us or deciding to maintain or increase your investment, you should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below and in our other filings are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. In that event, the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose your investment.\nRisks Related to our Banking Business\nOur banking business is highly regulated, which could limit or restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business.\nWe are subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve, and the Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the Commissioner and the FDIC. Federal and state laws and regulations govern numerous matters affecting us, including changes in the ownership or control of banks and bank holding companies, maintenance of adequate capital and the financial condition of a financial institution, permissible types, amounts and terms of extensions of credit and investments, permissible non-banking activities, the level of reserves against deposits and restrictions on dividend payments. The FDIC and the Commissioner have the power to issue cease and desist orders to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks subject to their regulation, and the Federal Reserve possesses similar powers with respect to bank holding companies. These and other restrictions limit the manner in which we and the Bank may conduct business and obtain financing.\nOur banking business is also affected by the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary or legislative policies may affect the interest rates the Bank must offer to attract deposits and the interest rates it must charge on loans, as well as the manner in which it offers deposits and makes loans. These monetary policies have had, and are expected to continue to have, significant effects on the operating results of depository institutions generally, including the Bank.\nBecause our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules, regulations, and supervisory guidance and policies applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change. It is impossible to predict the competitive impact that any such changes would have on the banking and financial services industry in general or on our business in particular. Such changes may, among other things, increase the cost of doing business, limit permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of government intervention in the financial services sector following the 2008 financial crisis. Other changes to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer, and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies, or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by federal or state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, and/or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. See Part I. Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Supervision and Regulation.\u201d\nWe have become subject to more stringent capital requirements.\nThe federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule, or the \u201cFinal Capital Rule,\u201d that implemented the Basel III capital standards and established the minimum capital levels required under the Dodd-Frank Act. As of January 1, 2015, we are required to comply with the Final Capital Rule. The Final Capital Rule requires banks and bank holding companies to maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets, a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% of risk-weighted assets, a total capital ratio of 8% of risk-weighted assets, and a leverage ratio of 4%. In addition, in connection with implementing the Final Capital Rule, the FDIC revised its prompt corrective action regulations for state nonmember banks to require a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% of risk-weighted assets for a \u201cwell capitalized\u201d institution and increased the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for a \u201cwell capitalized\u201d institution from 6% to 8%. Additionally, subject to a transition period, the Final Capital Rule requires banks and bank holding companies to maintain a 2.5% common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer above the minimum risk-based capital requirements for adequately capitalized institutions to avoid restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, discretionary bonuses, and to engage in share repurchases. The Company and the Bank met these requirements as of December 31, 2015. The Final Capital Rule permanently grandfathered trust preferred securities issued before May 19, 2010 for institutions with less than $15 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2009, subject to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital. The Final Capital Rule increased the required capital for certain categories of assets, including high volatility construction real estate loans and certain exposures related to securitizations; however, the Final Capital Rule retained the previous capital treatment of residential mortgages. Under the Final Capital Rule, we were permitted to make a one-time, permanent election to continue to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from capital. The Company has made this election.\nImplementation of these standards, or any other new regulations, may adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, or require us to reduce business levels or raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to many different counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, other commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other financial institutions. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by us or by other institutions and organizations. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nDeterioration in local economies or real estate markets could negatively impact our banking business.\nThe Private Banking Segment primarily serves individuals and smaller businesses located in three geographic regions: New England, San Francisco Bay, and Southern California. The ability of the Bank\u2019s clients to repay their loans is impacted by the economic conditions in these areas.\nThe Bank\u2019s commercial loans are generally concentrated in the following client groups:\n\u2022\nreal estate developers and investors;\n\u2022\nfinancial service providers;\n\u2022\ntechnology companies;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing and communications companies;\n\u2022\nprofessional service providers;\n\u2022\ngeneral commercial and industrial companies; and\n\u2022\nindividuals.\nThe Bank\u2019s commercial loans, with limited exceptions, are secured by real estate (usually income producing residential and commercial properties), marketable securities, or corporate assets (usually accounts receivable, equipment or inventory). Substantially all of the Bank\u2019s residential mortgage and home equity loans are secured by residential property. Consequently, the Bank\u2019s ability to continue to originate real estate loans may be impaired by adverse changes in local and regional economic conditions in the real estate markets, or by acts of nature, including earthquakes, hurricanes, and flooding. Due to the concentration of real estate collateral in the geographic regions in which we operate, these events could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the ability of the Bank\u2019s borrowers to repay their loans and affect the value of the collateral securing these loans.\nCompetition in the banking industry may impair our ability to attract and retain banking clients at current levels.\nCompetition in the markets in which the Bank operates may limit the ability of the Bank to attract and retain banking clients. The Bank\u2019s competitors include several major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Additionally, banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have larger lending limits and are able to serve the credit and investment needs of larger clients. The Bank also faces competition from out-of-state financial intermediaries that have opened low-end production offices or that solicit deposits in its respective market areas. There is also increased competition by out-of-market competitors through the Internet. Because the Bank maintains a smaller staff and has fewer financial and other resources than larger institutions with which it competes, it may be limited in its ability to attract clients. In addition, the Bank\u2019s current commercial banking clients may seek alternative banking sources as they develop needs for credit facilities larger than the Bank can accommodate. If the Bank is unable to attract and retain banking clients, it may be unable to continue its loan growth and its results of operations and financial condition may otherwise be negatively impacted.\nMarket changes may adversely affect demand for the Bank\u2019s services and impact results of operations.\nChannels for servicing the Bank\u2019s customers are evolving rapidly, with less reliance on traditional branch facilities, more use of online and mobile banking, and increased demand for universal bankers and other relationship managers who can service multiples product lines. The Bank competes with larger providers that are rapidly evolving their service channels and escalating the costs of evolving the service process. The Bank has a process for evaluating the profitability of its branch system and other office and operational facilities. The identification of unprofitable operations and facilities can lead to restructuring charges and introduce the risk of disruptions to revenues and customer relationships.\nOur cost of funds for banking operations may increase as a result of general economic conditions, interest rates and competitive pressures.\nThe Bank has traditionally obtained funds principally through deposits and borrowings. As a general matter, deposits are a cheaper source of funds than borrowings, because interest rates paid for deposits are typically less than interest rates charged for borrowings. If, as a result of general economic conditions, market interest rates, competitive pressures, or otherwise, the amount of deposits at the Bank decreases relative to its overall banking operations, the Bank may have to rely more heavily on borrowings as a source of funds in the future.\nDefaults in the repayment of loans may require additional loan loss reserves and negatively impact our banking business.\nA borrower\u2019s default on its obligations under one or more Bank loans may result in lost principal and interest income and increased operating expenses as a result of the allocation of management time and resources to the collection and work-out of the loan. In certain situations, where collection efforts are unsuccessful or acceptable work-out arrangements cannot be reached, the Bank may have to charge-off the loan in whole or in part. In such situations, the Bank may acquire real estate or other assets, if any, which secure the loan through foreclosure or other similar available remedies. In such cases, the amount owed under the defaulted loan often exceeds the value of the assets acquired.\nThe Bank\u2019s management periodically makes a determination of an allowance for loan losses based on available information, including the quality of its loan portfolio, certain economic conditions, the value of the underlying collateral, and the level of its nonaccruing and criticized loans. We rely on our loan quality reviews, our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors, in determining the level required for the allowance for loan losses. If, as a result of general economic conditions, changes in estimates, or an increase in defaulted loans, management determines that further increases in the allowance for loan losses are necessary, we will incur additional expenses.\nIf it is determined that the Bank should sell certain loans or a portfolio of loans, we are required to classify those loans as \u201cheld for sale\u201d which requires us to carry such loans at the lower of amortized cost or market. If we decide to sell loans at a time when the fair value of those loans is less than their carrying value, the adjustment will result in a charge to the allowance for loan losses if the decline in value is due to credit issues. We may from time to time decide to sell particular loans or groups of loans, and the required adjustment could negatively affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses and the values it attributes to real estate acquired through foreclosure or other similar remedies. Such regulatory agencies may require the Bank\nto adjust its determination of the value for these items. These adjustments could negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition.\nFluctuations in interest rates may negatively impact our banking business.\nFluctuations in interest rates may negatively impact the business of the Bank. The Bank\u2019s main source of income from operations is net interest income, which represents the difference between the interest income earned on interest-bearing assets (usually loans and investment securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (usually deposits and borrowings). These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, both domestic and foreign, and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. The Bank\u2019s net interest income can be affected significantly by changes in market interest rates. Changes in relative interest rates may reduce the Bank\u2019s net interest income as the difference between interest income and interest expense decreases. As a result, the Bank has adopted asset and liability management policies to mitigate the potential adverse effects of changes in interest rates on net interest income, primarily by altering the mix and maturity of loans, investments funding sources, and derivatives. However, even with these policies in place, a change in interest rates can impact our results of operations or financial condition.\nAn increase in interest rates could also have a negative impact on the Bank\u2019s results of operations by reducing the ability of borrowers to repay their current loan obligations, which could not only result in increased loan defaults, foreclosures, and charge-offs, but also necessitate increases to our allowances for loan losses. Fluctuations in interest rates, in certain circumstances, may also lead to high levels of loan prepayments, which may also have an adverse impact on our net interest income.\nPrepayments of loans may negatively impact our banking business.\nGenerally, the Bank\u2019s clients may prepay the principal amount of their outstanding loans at any time. The speed at which such prepayments occur, as well as the size of such prepayments, are within our clients\u2019 discretion. If clients prepay the principal amount of their loans, and we are unable to lend those funds to other borrowers or invest the funds at the same or higher interest rates, our interest income will be reduced. A significant reduction in interest income could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur loan portfolio includes commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, and construction and land loans, which are generally riskier than other types of loans.\nAt December 31, 2015, our commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, and construction and land loans portfolios comprised 56% of total loans. Commercial loans generally carry larger loan balances and involve a higher risk of nonpayment or late payment than residential mortgage loans. These loans may lack standardized terms and may include a balloon payment feature. The ability of a borrower to make or refinance a balloon payment may be affected by a number of factors, including the financial condition of the borrower, prevailing economic conditions, interest rates, and collateral values. Repayment of these loans is generally more dependent on the economy and the successful operation of a business. Because of the risks associated with commercial loans, we may experience higher rates of default than if the portfolio were more heavily weighted toward residential mortgage loans. Higher rates of default could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental liability associated with commercial lending could result in losses.\nIn the course of business, the Bank may acquire, through foreclosure, properties securing loans it has originated or purchased which are in default. Particularly in commercial real estate lending, there is a risk that material environmental violations could be discovered at these properties. In this event, we or the Bank might be required to remedy these violations at the affected properties at our sole cost and expense. The cost of this remedial action could substantially exceed the value of affected properties. We may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties. These events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Investment Management, Wealth Advisory, and Wealth Management and Trust Businesses\nOur investment management, wealth advisory, and wealth management and trust businesses are highly regulated, and the regulators have the ability to limit or restrict our activities and impose fines or suspensions on the conduct of our business.\nOur investment management, wealth advisory, and wealth management and trust businesses are highly regulated, primarily at the federal level. The failure of any of our subsidiaries that provide investment management, wealth advisory, and wealth management and trust services to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, suspensions of individual employees or other sanctions including revocation of such affiliate\u2019s registration as an investment adviser.\nAll of our investment management, wealth advisory, and wealth management and trust affiliates are RIAs under the Advisers Act. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on RIAs, including fiduciary, record keeping, operational and disclosure obligations. These subsidiaries, as investment advisers, are also subject to regulation under the federal and state securities laws and the fiduciary laws of certain states. In addition, the affiliates acting as sub-advisers to mutual funds are subject to certain provisions and regulations of the 1940 Act.\nWe are also subject to the provisions and regulations of ERISA to the extent that we act as a \u201cfiduciary\u201d under ERISA with respect to certain of our clients. ERISA and the applicable provisions of the federal tax laws, impose a number of duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of each ERISA plan which is a client, as well as certain transactions by the fiduciaries (and certain other related parties) to such plans.\nIn addition, applicable law provides that all investment contracts with mutual fund clients may be terminated by the clients, without penalty, upon no more than 60 days\u2019 notice. Investment contracts with institutional and other clients are typically terminable by the client, also without penalty, upon 30 days\u2019 notice.\nChanges in these laws or regulations could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and mode of operations.\nOur investment management businesses may be negatively impacted by changes in economic and market conditions.\nOur investment management business may be negatively impacted by changes in general economic and market conditions because the performance of such business is directly affected by conditions in the financial and securities markets. The financial markets and businesses operating in the securities industry are highly volatile (meaning that performance results can vary greatly within short periods of time) and are directly affected by, among other factors, domestic and foreign economic conditions and general trends in business and finance, all of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that broad market performance will be favorable in the future. Declines in the financial markets or a lack of sustained growth may result in a corresponding decline in our performance and may adversely affect the assets that we manage.\nIn addition, our management contracts generally provide for fees payable for investment management services based on the market value of assets under management, although there are a portion of our contracts that provide for the payment of fees based on investment performance in addition to a base fee. Because most contracts provide for a fee based on market values of securities, fluctuations in securities prices may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain investment management, wealth advisory, and wealth management and trust clients due to competition.\nDue to intense competition, our investment management, wealth advisory, and wealth management and trust subsidiaries may not be able to attract and retain clients. Competition is especially strong in our geographic market areas because there are numerous well-established, well-resourced, well-capitalized, and successful investment management, wealth advisory, and wealth management and trust firms in these areas.\nOur ability to successfully attract and retain investment management, wealth advisory, and wealth management and trust clients is dependent upon our ability to compete with competitors\u2019 investment products, level of investment performance, client services and marketing and distribution capabilities. If we are not successful, our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted.\nInvestment management contracts are typically terminable upon less than 30 days\u2019 notice. Most of our investment management clients may withdraw funds from accounts under management generally in their sole discretion. Wealth advisory client contracts must typically be renewed on an annual basis and are terminable upon relatively short notice. The combined\nfinancial performance of our investment management, wealth advisory, and wealth management and trust affiliates is a significant factor in our overall results of operations and financial condition.\nOur investment management business is highly dependent on investment managers to produce investment returns and to solicit and retain clients, and the loss of a key investment manager could adversely affect our investment management, wealth advisory, and wealth management and trust business.\nWe rely on our investment managers to produce investment returns. We believe that investment performance is one of the most important factors for the growth of our assets under management. Poor investment performance could impair our revenues and growth because existing clients might withdraw funds in favor of better performing products, which would result in lower investment management fees or our ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish.\nThe market for investment managers is extremely competitive and is increasingly characterized by frequent movement of investment managers among different firms. In addition, our individual investment managers often have regular direct contact with particular clients, which can lead to a strong client relationship based on the client\u2019s trust in that individual manager. The loss of a key investment manager could jeopardize our relationships with our clients and lead to the loss of client accounts. Losses of such accounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Overall Business and Operations\nOur business and earnings have been adversely affected, and may continue to be adversely affected, by the U.S. and international financial markets and economic conditions.\nThe performance of our business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by general business and economic conditions in the U.S., including the level and volatility of short- and long-term interest rates, inflation, home prices, unemployment and under-employment levels, bankruptcies, household income, consumer spending, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, liquidity of the global financial markets, the availability and cost of credit, and investor confidence. While in recent years there has been gradual improvement in the U.S. economy, deterioration of any of these conditions can adversely affect our residential portfolio, consumer and commercial businesses, and securities portfolios, as well as our earnings.\nWe may incur significant losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies.\nWe seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a risk and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance, and legal reporting systems; internal controls; management review processes; and other mechanisms. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application may not be effective and may not anticipate every economic and financial outcome in all market environments or the specifics and timing of such outcomes. Market conditions over the last several years have involved unprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain key employees.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key employees. Competition for the best people can be intense and we may not be able to hire or retain the key employees that we depend upon for success. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key employees could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of the markets in which we operate, years of industry experience, and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement employees.\nOur ability to attract and retain clients and employees, and to maintain relationships with vendors, third-party service providers and others, could be adversely affected to the extent our reputation is harmed.\nWe are dependent on our reputation within our market area, as a trusted and responsible financial company, for all aspects of our relationships with clients, employees, vendors, third-party service providers, and others with whom we conduct business or potential future business. Our ability to attract and retain clients and employees at our banking, wealth management and trust, investment management, and wealth advisory subsidiaries could be adversely affected to the extent our reputation is damaged. Our actual or perceived failure to address various issues could give rise to reputational risk that could cause harm to us and our business prospects. These issues also include, but are not limited to, legal and regulatory requirements; privacy; properly maintaining client and employee personal information; record keeping; money-laundering; sales and trading practices; ethical issues; appropriately addressing potential conflicts of interest; and the proper identification of the legal, reputational, credit, liquidity, and market risks inherent in our products. Failure to appropriately address any of these issues could also give rise to additional regulatory restrictions, reputational harm, and legal risks, which could, among other consequences, increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to enforcement actions, fines, and penalties and cause us to incur related costs and expenses. In addition, our investment management business is dependent on the integrity of our asset managers and our employees. If an asset manager or employee were to misappropriate any client funds, the reputation of our asset management business could be negatively affected, which may result in the loss of accounts and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and core application processing. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, using established criteria and complying with applicable regulatory guidance to evaluate each vendor\u2019s overall capabilities, financial stability, and internal control environment, we do not control their daily business environment and actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers, impair our ability to conduct our business efficiently and effectively, and/or result in regulatory action, financial loss, litigation, and loss of reputation. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nWe may suffer losses as a result of operational risk or technical system failures.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, data processing system failures and errors, inadequate or failed internal processes, customer or employee fraud and catastrophic failures resulting from terrorist acts or natural disasters. We depend upon data processing, software, communication, and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks and over the Internet, and we rely on the services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs. Despite instituted safeguards, we cannot be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack or other technological difficulties or failures. Information security risks have increased significantly due to the use of online, telephone and mobile banking channels by clients and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties. Our technologies, systems, networks and our clients\u2019 devices have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, malicious code, phishing attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our clients\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information, the theft of client assets through fraudulent transactions or disruption of our or our clients\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations. If information security is breached or other technology difficulties or failures occur, information may be lost or misappropriated, and services and operations may be interrupted. A security breach could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, significant litigation exposure, and harm to our reputation. While we maintain a system of internal controls and procedures, any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nWe may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even inadvertent or unintentional violations.\nWe maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations. However, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though there were systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance in place at the time. For example, we are subject to regulations issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or \u201cOFAC,\u201d that prohibit financial institutions from participating in the transfer of property belonging to the governments of certain foreign countries, designated nationals of those countries, and certain other persons or entities whose interest in property is blocked by OFAC-administered sanctions. OFAC may impose penalties for inadvertent or unintentional violations even if reasonable processes are in place to prevent the violations. There may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance, including restrictions on certain activities. Such a finding may also damage our reputation as described below and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities.\nWe face significant legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against us.\nFrom time to time we are named as a defendant or are otherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. There is no assurance that litigation with private parties will not increase in the future. Future actions against us may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to us, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm to us. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that we could experience a high level of litigation related to our businesses and operations.\nOur businesses and operations are also subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. These and other initiatives from federal and state officials may subject us to further judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause us to be required to restructure our operations and activities, all of which could lead to reputational issues, or higher operational costs, thereby reducing our profitability.\nTo the extent that we acquire other companies in the future, our business may be negatively impacted by certain risks inherent in such acquisitions.\nWe continue to consider the acquisition of other private banking, wealth management and trust, investment management, and wealth advisory companies. To the extent that we acquire other companies in the future, our business may be negatively impacted by certain risks inherent in such acquisitions. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe risk that we will incur substantial expenses in pursuing potential acquisitions without completing such acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe risk that we may lose key clients or employees of the acquired business as a result of the change of ownership to us;\n\u2022\nthe risk that the acquired business will not perform in accordance with our expectations;\n\u2022\nthe risk that difficulties will arise in connection with the integration of the operations of the acquired business with the operations of our private banking, wealth management and trust, investment management, or wealth advisory businesses, particularly to the extent we may enter new geographic markets;\n\u2022\nthe risk that we will need to make significant investments in infrastructure, controls, staff, emergency backup facilities or other critical business functions that become strained by our growth;\n\u2022\nthe risk that management may divert its attention from other aspects of our business;\n\u2022\nthe risk that unanticipated costs relating to potential acquisitions could reduce our earnings per share;\n\u2022\nthe risk associated with entering into geographic and product markets in which we have limited or no direct prior experience;\n\u2022\nthe risk that we may assume potential liabilities of the acquired company as a result of the acquisition; and\n\u2022\nthe risk that an acquisition will dilute our earnings per share, in both the short and long term, or that it will reduce our regulatory and tangible capital ratios.\nAs a result of these risks, any given acquisition, if and when consummated, may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, because the consideration for an acquisition may involve cash, debt or the issuance of shares of our stock and may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, existing stockholders may experience dilution in connection with any acquisition.\nRisks Related to Accounting and Accounting Changes\nOur financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates, which, if wrong, could cause unexpected losses in the future.\nPursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\u201cGAAP\u201d), we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including in determining loan loss reserves, reserves related to litigation, if any, and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. If assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material fluctuations in our results of operations. For additional information, see Part II. Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies.\u201d\nChanges in accounting standards can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to anticipate and implement and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.\nGoodwill and other intangible asset impairment would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nGenerally, the acquirer in a business combination is willing to pay more for a business than the sum of the fair values of the individual assets and liabilities because of other inherent value associated with an assembled business. The resulting excess of the consideration transferred over the net fair value of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, is recognized as goodwill. An essential part of the acquisition method is the recognition and measurement of identifiable intangible assets, separate from goodwill, at fair value. At December 31, 2015, our goodwill and net intangible assets totaled $185.1 million.\nUnder current accounting standards, goodwill acquired in a business combination is recognized as an asset and not amortized. Instead, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if there is an indication of impairment. Long-lived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable.\nIf we determine goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, we will be required to write down the value of these assets. We last took an impairment charge in 2009. We cannot assure you that we will not be required to take further impairment charges in the future. Any impairment charge would have a negative effect on our shareholders\u2019 equity and financial results.\nNet outflows of assets under management at Anchor in recent years and Boston Private Wealth in 2015 have negatively impacted their financial results. In addition, the decline in the U.S. equity markets in early 2016 will, until recovered, have a further negative impact on assets under management at these firms. If net outflows at these firms continue and/or the U.S. equity markets do not recover in the short term, the risk of impairment will increase. In addition to current financial results, other information such as forecasted earnings and market comparisons for these types of firms are used to determine the fair value of these firms and whether there is indication of impairment.\nMaterial negative changes in the assumptions or inputs in to the valuation models will increase the risk of impairment. The Company will continue to monitor the events and circumstances at these firms for indication of a triggering event that would necessitate impairment testing prior to the usual testing in the fourth quarter.\nOur deferred tax assets may not ultimately be realized or our tax positions may be subject to challenge by taxing authorities.\nOur deferred tax assets may provide significant future tax savings. Our use of these deferred tax benefits may depend on a number of factors including our ability to generate significant future taxable income; the character of that income (ordinary versus capital); the absence of a future ownership change that could limit or eliminate the tax benefits; the acceptance by the taxing authorities of the positions taken on our tax returns as to the amount and timing of our income and expenses; and future changes in laws or regulations relating to tax credits, tax deductions, and net operating losses. At December 31, 2015, our net deferred tax assets were $51.7 million.\nWe assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realizable based primarily on future taxable income and tax planning strategies and, if necessary, establish a valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets determined to not likely be realizable. Management judgment is required in determining the appropriate recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, including projections of future taxable income, as well as the character of that income.\nIn evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers the following:\n\u2022\ncumulative pre-tax income or loss, as adjusted for permanent book-to-tax differences, over the current and previous two years;\n\u2022\nfuture reversals of existing taxable temporary differences;\n\u2022\nthe projection of future taxable income to be generated by operations during the available loss carryforward period;\n\u2022\ntax planning strategies that are available and whether any are limited based upon the Company\u2019s market capitalization in excess of its book value; and\n\u2022\nwhether there has been any operating loss or tax credit carry-overs expiring unused.\nThere can be no absolute assurance however, that the net deferred tax assets will ultimately be realized.\nRisks Related to Our Liquidity\nWe are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends.\nWe are a legal entity that is separate and distinct from the Bank and our other subsidiaries and depend on dividends from the Bank and our other subsidiaries to fund dividend payments on our common and preferred stock and to fund all payments on our other obligations. Our revenue (on a parent-only basis) is derived primarily from dividends paid to us by the Bank and our other subsidiaries. Our right, and consequently the right of our shareholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of the Bank and our other subsidiaries through the payment of such dividends or otherwise is necessarily subject to the prior claims of creditors of the Bank (including depositors) and our other subsidiaries, except to the extent that certain claims of ours in a creditor capacity may be recognized.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when, as, and if declared by our board of directors. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common and preferred stock, we are not required to do so. Our board of directors may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. Further, if we do not pay dividends on our preferred stock, we may not pay any dividends on our common stock. The Federal Reserve has authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if such payment is deemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice. Additionally, the FDIC has the authority to use its enforcement powers to prohibit a bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. The Final Capital Rule requires banks and bank holding companies to maintain a 2.5% common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer above the minimum risk-based capital requirements for adequately capitalized institutions to avoid restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, discretionary bonuses, and to engage in share repurchases. The Company and the Bank met these requirements as of December 31, 2015. A reduction or elimination of dividends could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. See Part I. Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Supervision and Regulation - Dividend Restrictions\u201d and \u201cBusiness - Supervision and Regulation - Regulatory Capital Requirements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nFuture capital offerings may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources or, if our or the Bank\u2019s capital ratios fall below required minimums, we or the Bank could be forced to raise additional capital by making additional offerings of debt, common or preferred stock, trust preferred securities, and senior or subordinated notes. Upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock.\nAdditional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings.\nWe cannot assure you that such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our inability to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. Thus, our shareholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their stock holdings in us.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. We cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include:\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our operating results or the quality of our assets;\n\u2022\noperating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts, and investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u2022\nannouncements of innovations, new products, strategic developments, significant contracts, acquisitions, and other material events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to us;\n\u2022\nour past and future dividend practices;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our equity or equity-related securities; and\n\u2022\nchanges in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest rates, stock, commodity or real estate valuations or volatility.\nAnti-takeover provisions could negatively impact our shareholders.\nProvisions of Massachusetts law, the BHCA, and provisions of our articles of organization and by-laws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. Our articles of organization authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval and such preferred stock could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal. These and other provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our shareholders.", "PERMNO": 80223, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BPFH"}
