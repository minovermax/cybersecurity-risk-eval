{"cik": "1429764", "company": "Car Charging Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-07-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business as they may have a significant impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance should not be considered as a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRelating to Our Business\nOur revenue growth depends on consumers\u2019 willingness to adopt EVs.\nOur growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of, and we are subject to a risk of any reduced demand for EVs. If the market for EVs does not gain broad market acceptance or develops more slowly than we expect, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be harmed. The market for alternative fuel vehicles is relatively new, rapidly evolving, characterized by rapidly changing technologies, price competition, additional competitors, evolving government regulation and industry standards, frequent new vehicle announcements, long development cycles for EV original equipment manufacturers and changing consumer demands and behaviors. Factors that may influence the purchase and use of alternative fuel vehicles, and specifically EVs, include:\n\u25cf perceptions about EV quality, safety (in particular with respect to lithium-ion battery packs), design, performance and cost, especially if adverse events or accidents occur that are linked to the quality or safety of EVs;\n\u25cf the limited range over which EVs may be driven on a single battery charge and concerns about running out of power while in use;\n\u25cf improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine;\n\u25cf consumers\u2019 desire and ability to purchase a luxury automobile or one that is perceived as exclusive;\n\u25cf the environmental consciousness of consumers;\n\u25cf volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline;\n\u25cf consumers\u2019 perceptions of the dependency of the U.S. on oil from unstable or hostile countries and the impact of international conflicts;\n\u25cf government regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy;\n\u25cf access to charging stations, standardization of EV charging systems and consumers\u2019 perceptions about convenience and cost to charge an EV; and\n\u25cf the availability of tax and other governmental incentives to purchase and operate EVs or suture regulation requiring increased use of nonpolluting vehicles.\nThe influence of any of the factors described above may negatively impact the widespread consumer adoption of EVs, which would materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nWe need additional capital to fund our growing operations and cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain sufficient capital on reasonable terms or at all, and we may be faced to limit the scope of our operations.\nWe need additional capital to fund our growing operations and if adequate additional financing is not available on reasonable terms or available at all, we may not be able to undertake expansion or continue our marketing efforts and we would have to modify our business plans accordingly. The extent of our capital needs will depend on numerous factors, including (i) our profitability; (ii) the release of competitive products and/or services by our competition; (iii) the level of our investment in research and development; (iv) the amount of our capital expenditures, including acquisitions, and (v) our growth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain capital in the future to meet our needs.\nEven if we do find a source of additional capital, we may not be able to negotiate terms and conditions for receiving the additional capital that are acceptable to us. Any future capital investments could dilute or otherwise materially and adversely affect the holdings or rights of our existing shareholders. In addition, new equity or convertible debt securities issued by us to obtain financing could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock. We cannot give you any assurance that any additional financing will be available to us, or if available, will be on terms favorable to us.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm with respect to our financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and for the year then ended indicates that our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. The report states that, since we have incurred net losses since inception and we need to raise additional funds to meet our obligations and sustain our operations, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our plans in regard to these matters are described in footnote two to our audited financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and for the years then ended, which are included following Item 15 - Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nWe have a history of significant losses, and if we do not achieve and sustain profitability, our financial condition could suffer.\nWe have experienced significant net losses, and we expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We incurred net losses of $8.2 million and $23.2 million the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and as of December 31, 2015 our accumulated deficit was $73.4 million. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have, for the foreseeable future, an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital. If our revenue grows more slowly than we anticipate, or if our operating expenses are higher than we expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability and our financial condition could suffer. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods.\nThe unavailability, reduction or elimination of government incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nCurrently, government grants account for 29% of our revenues. Any reduction, elimination or discriminatory application of government subsidies and economic incentives because of policy changes, fiscal tightening or other reasons may result in diminished revenues from government sources and diminished demand for our products. This could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nOur growth depends in part on the availability and amounts of government subsidies for EV charging equipment. In the event such subsidies discontinue, our business outlook and financial conditions could be negatively impacted.\nIf we are unable to keep up with advances in electric vehicle technology, we may suffer a decline in our competitive position.\nThe EV industry is characterized by rapid technological change. If we are unable to keep up with changes in EV technology, our competitive position may deteriorate which would materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. As technologies change, we plan to upgrade or adapt our EV charging stations and Blink Network software in order to continue to provide EV charging services with the latest technology. However, due to our limited cash resources, our efforts to do so may be limited. For example, the EV charging network that we acquired from Ecotality was originally funded, in part, by the U.S. Department of Energy, which funding is no longer available to us. As a result, we may be unable to grow, maintain and enhance the network of charging stations that we acquired from Ecotality at the same rate and scale as Ecotality did prior to the acquisition or at levels comparable our current competitors. Any failure of our charging stations to compete effectively with other manufacturers\u2019 charging stations will harm our business, operating results and prospects.\nWe need to manage growth in operations to realize our growth potential and achieve our expected revenues, and our failure to manage growth will cause a disruption of our operations resulting in the failure to generate revenue and an impairment of our long-lived assets.\nIn order to take advantage of the growth that we anticipate in our current and potential markets, we believe that we must expand our marketing operations. This expansion will place a significant strain on our management and our operational, accounting, and information systems. We expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial controls, operating procedures and management information systems. We will also need to effectively train, motivate and manage our employees. Our failure to manage our growth could disrupt our operations and ultimately prevent us from generating the revenues we expect.\nIn order to achieve the above-mentioned targets, the general strategies of our Company are to maintain and search for hard-working employees who have innovative initiatives; as well as to keep a close eye on expansion opportunities through merger and/or acquisition.\nWe have limited insurance coverage, and any claims beyond our insurance coverage may result in our incurring substantial costs and a diversion of resources.\nWe hold employer\u2019s liability insurance generally covering death or work-related injury of employees. We hold public liability insurance covering certain incidents involving third parties that occur on or in the premises of the Company. We hold directors and officers liability insurance. We do not maintain key-man life insurance on any of our senior management or key personnel, or business interruption insurance. Our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover any claim for product liability, damage to our fixed assets or employee injuries. Any liability or damage to, or caused by, our facilities or our personnel beyond our insurance coverage may result in our incurring substantial costs and a diversion of resources.\nOur future success depends, in part, on the performance and continued service of our officers.\nWe presently depend to a great extent upon the experience, abilities and continued services of Michael Calise, Michael D. Farkas, Andy Kinard and Ira Feintuch, our management team. The loss of services of Mr. Calise, Mr. Farkas, Mr. Kinard or Mr. Feintuch could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel.\nOur future success also depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Expansion of our business and the management and operation of the Company will require additional managers and employees with industry experience, and our success will be highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel and other employees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified personnel. As our industry continues to evolve, competition for skilled personnel with the requisite experience will be significant. This competition may make it more difficult and expensive to attract, hire and retain qualified managers and employees.\nWe are in an intensely competitive industry and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete with our competitors who may have greater resources.\nThe Company faces strong competition from competitors in the EV charging services industry, including competitors who could duplicate our model. Many of these competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing and development resources and other capabilities than the Company. In addition, there are very few barriers to entry into the market for our services. There can be no assurance, therefore, that any of our current and future competitors, many of whom may have far greater resources, will not independently develop services that are substantially equivalent or superior to our services. Therefore, an investment in the Company is very risky and speculative due to the competitive environment in which the Company may operate.\nIf a third party asserts that we are infringing its intellectual property, whether successful or not, it could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses, and our business may be harmed.\nThe EV and EV charging industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets. As we face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. Additionally, although we have acquired from other companies proprietary technology covered by patents, we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Intellectual property infringement claims against us could harm our relationships with our customers, may deter future customers from subscribing to our services or could expose us to litigation with respect to these claims. Even if we are not a party to any litigation between a customer and a third party, an adverse outcome in any such litigation could make it more difficult for us to defend our intellectual property in any subsequent litigation in which we are a named party. Any of these results could harm our brand and operating results.\nAny intellectual property rights claim against us or our customers, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management resources and attention. An adverse determination also could prevent us from offering our services to our customers and may require that we procure or develop substitute services that do not infringe.\nWith respect to any intellectual property rights claim against us or our customers, we may have to pay damages or stop using technology found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights. We may have to seek a license for the technology, which may not be available on reasonable terms, may significantly increase our operating expenses or require us to restrict our business activities in one or more respects. The technology also may not be available for license to us at all. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense.\nThe success of our business depends in large part on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, service mark, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which provide only limited protection. We cannot assure you that any patents will issue with respect to our currently pending patent applications, in a manner that gives us the protection that we seek, if at all, or that any future patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Our currently issued patents and any patents that may issue in the future with respect to pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection or they may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers. Also, we cannot assure you that any future service mark registrations will be issued with respect to pending or future applications or that any registered service marks will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights.\nWe endeavor to enter into agreements with our employees and contractors and agreements with parties with whom we do business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology or the reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property. The enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our legal actions against these infringers being successful, but we cannot be sure these actions will be successful, even when our rights have been infringed.\nFurthermore, effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our services are available over the Internet. In addition, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in EV-related industries are uncertain and still evolving.\nRisks Associated with Our Common Stock\nOur prior failure to prepare and file timely our periodic reports with the sec limits us from accessing the public markets to raise debt or equity capital. In addition, our common stock is not currently Rule 144 eligibile and we are unable to file a registration statement as contemplated under the terms of a registration rights agreement entered into on July 24, 2015 with Eventide.\nWe have not filed a Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Because we are not current in our reporting requirements with the SEC, we are limited in our ability to access the public markets to raise debt or equity capital. Our limited ability to access the public markets could prevent us from pursuing transactions or implementing business strategies that we believe would be beneficial to our business. As a result of our failure to file our SEC filings by the filing date required by the SEC (including the grace period permitted by Rule 12b-25 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), our common stock is not eligible for resale under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Accordingly, investors and holders of our common stock may not be able to sell their stock until we are current under the 1934 Act.\nIn addition, on July 24, 2015, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement with Eventide Gilead Fund (\u201cEventide\u201d) whereby Eventide purchased shares of preferred stock and warrants in the Company and the Company agreed to file a Registration Statement within 120 calendar days following the Closing Date to register such shares and warrant shares. We cannot file a Registration Statement until we are current in our Exchange Act filings and, therefore, we may be subject to penalties from Eventide.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud. Any inability to report and file our financial results accurately and timely could harm our reputation and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. As a result, our small size and any current internal control deficiencies may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and access to capital. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses described below.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, within the meaning of Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) Audit Standard No. 5, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has identified the following material weaknesses which have caused management to conclude that as of December 31, 2015 our internal controls over financial reporting (\u201cICFR\u201d) were not effective at the reasonable assurance level:\n1. We do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act which is applicable to us for the year ended December 31, 2015. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have written documentation of our internal controls and procedures on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness.\n2. We do not have sufficient resources in our accounting function, which restricts the Company\u2019s ability to gather, analyze and properly review information related to financial reporting in a timely manner. In addition, due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness.\n3. We do not have personnel with sufficient experience with United States generally accepted accounting principles to address complex transactions.\n4. We have inadequate controls to ensure that information necessary to properly record transactions is adequately communicated on a timely basis from non-financial personnel to those responsible for financial reporting. Management evaluated the impact of the lack of timely communication between non-financial and financial personnel on our assessment of our reporting controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency represented a material weakness.\n5. We have determined that oversight over our external financial reporting and internal control over our financial reporting by our audit committee is ineffective. The audit committee has not provided adequate review of the Company\u2019s SEC\u2019s filings and consolidated financial statements and has not provided adequate supervision and review of the Company\u2019s accounting personnel or oversight of the independent registered accounting firm\u2019s audit of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statement.\nWe have taken steps to remediate some of the weaknesses described above, including by engaging financial consultants with expertise in accounting for complex transactions. We intend to continue to address these weaknesses as resources permit.\nOur common stock is currently quoted only on the OTC Pink marketplace (\u201cOTC Pink\u201d), which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink. The OTC Pink is a significantly more limited market than the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market. The quotation of our shares on the OTC Pink may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock, could depress the trading price of our common stock and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future.\nThere can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future. Market liquidity will depend on the perception of our operating business and any steps that our management might take to bring us to the awareness of investors. There can be no assurance given that there will be any awareness generated. Consequently, investors may not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business. As a result holders of our securities may not find purchasers for our securities should they to desire to sell them. Consequently, our securities should be purchased only by investors having no need for liquidity in their investment and who can hold our securities for an indefinite period of time.\nOur shares of common stock are very thinly traded, and the price may not reflect our value and there can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future.\nOur shares of common stock are very thinly traded, and the price, if traded, may not reflect our value. There can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future. The market liquidity will be dependent on the perception of our operating business and any steps that our management might take to increase awareness of the Company with investors. There can be no assurance given that there will be any awareness generated. Consequently, investors may not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business. If a more active market should develop, the price may be highly volatile. Because there may be a low price for our shares of common stock, many brokerage firms may not be willing to effect transactions in the securities. Even if an investor finds a broker willing to effect a transaction in the shares of our common stock, the combination of brokerage commissions, transfer fees, taxes, if any, and any other selling costs may exceed the selling price. Further, many lending institutions will not permit the use of such shares of common stock as collateral for loans.\nFuture issuance of our common stock, preferred stock, options and warrants could dilute the interests of exisitng stockholders.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock, preferred stock, options and warrants in the future. The issuance of a substantial amount of common stock, options and warrants could have the effect of substantially diluting the interests of our current stockholders. In addition, the sale of a substantial amount of common stock or preferred stock in the public market, or the exercise of a substantial number of warrants and options either in the initial issuance or in a subsequent resale by the target company in an acquisition which received such common stock as consideration or by investors who acquired such common stock in a private placement could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThe application of the security and exchange commission\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules to our common stock could limit trading activity in the market, and our stockholders may find it more difficult to sell their stock.\nOur common stock continues to trade at less than $5.00 per share and is, therefore, subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (\u201cSEC\u201d) penny stock rules. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00. Penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The broker-dealer must also make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, which could severely limit their market price and liquidity of our securities. These requirements may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and may affect your ability to resell our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, and you must rely on increases in the market prices of our common stock for returns on your investment.\nFor the foreseeable future, we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, investors must be prepared to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation to earn an investment return, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the Board and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors the Board deems relevant.", "PERMNO": 17313, "SIC": 7500, "TIC": "BLNK"}
