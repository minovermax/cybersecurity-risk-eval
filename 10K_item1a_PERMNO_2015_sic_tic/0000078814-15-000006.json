RISK FACTORS\nOur operations face certain risks that should be considered in evaluating our business. We manage and mitigate these risks on a proactive basis, including through the use of an enterprise risk management program. Nevertheless, the following risk factors, some of which may be beyond our control, could materially impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, brand and reputation, and may cause future results to be materially different than our current expectations. These risk factors are not intended to be all inclusive.\nWe are subject to postal regulations and processes, which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nA significant portion of our revenue and profitability is directly or indirectly subject to regulation and oversight by postal authorities worldwide. We depend on a healthy postal sector in the geographic markets where we do business, which could be influenced positively or negatively by legislative or regulatory changes in those countries. Our revenue and profitability in a particular country could be affected by adverse changes in postal regulations, the business processes and practices of individual posts, the decision of a post to enter into particular markets in direct competition with us and the impact of any of these changes on postal competitors that do not use our products or services. These changes could affect product specifications, service offerings, client behavior and the overall mailing industry.\nThe volume of physical mail delivered via traditional postal services has been declining and is projected to continue to decline. If we are not successful at addressing this decline and transitioning to more digital-based products and services, our results of operations and profitability could be adversely impacted.\nThe historical decline in mail volumes has had an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability and is expected to continue to influence our revenue and profitability in the future. We have been employing strategies for stabilizing our mailing business and providing our clients broader access to products and services through online and direct sales channels. In addition, we are introducing new products and services and transitioning our current products and services to more digital offerings; however, the margins associated with these digital offerings are typically lower than our traditional mailing business. There is no guarantee that these offerings will be widely accepted in the marketplace, and they will likely face competition from existing and emerging alternative products and services.\nFurther, an accelerated or sudden decline in physical mail volumes could have an adverse effect on our mailing business. An accelerated or sudden decline could result from, among other things, changes in our clients' communication behavior, changes in communication technologies or legislation or regulations that mandate electronic substitution, prohibit certain types of mailings, increase the difficulty of using information or materials in the mail, or impose higher taxes or fees on mailing or postal services.\nIf we are not successful at meeting the continuing challenges faced in our mailing business, or if physical mail volumes were to experience an accelerated or sudden decline, our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nIf we are not successful in increasing revenue in our DCS segment, our consolidated revenues, profitability and long-term growth could be adversely impacted.\nWe are executing on a strategy to grow revenue significantly in our DCS segment. The successful execution of this strategy will require us to make continued investments in research and development opportunities that offer the greatest potential for near and long-term growth. These investments include, among other things, new and enhanced offerings in our global ecommerce, location intelligence and customer engagement solutions, and the specialization of sales channels. However, the process of developing new technologies, products and solutions can be time-consuming, costly and uncertain, and there are no guarantees that we will be successful developing new technologies and solutions to meet rapidly changing customer needs. Further, even if we are successful at developing new technologies and solutions, they may not be accepted by the marketplace.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits from our planned implementation of a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, and the transition to the new ERP system may not be uninterrupted or error-free.\nWe are in the process of implementing a new ERP system that is expected to provide operating cost savings through the elimination of redundant systems and strategic efficiencies through the use of a standardized, integrated system. We have made and will continue to make significant investments and incur incremental expenses over the course of the implementation of this ERP system. We expect this implementation will begin in 2015 and occur in stages over the next few years. If the implementation of the system is not successful, or is delayed, the expected operating cost savings and strategic efficiencies may be delayed or may not be obtained or sustainable.\nFurther, the transition to the new ERP system will affect numerous systems necessary for the company's operation. If we fail to correctly implement one or more components of the new ERP system, we could experience significant disruption to our operations. Such disruptions could include, among other things, temporary loss of data, inability to process certain orders, failure of systems to communicate with each other and the inability to track or reconcile key data.\nIf we are unable to protect our information technology systems against service interruptions, misappropriation of data, or breaches of security resulting from cyber-attacks or other events, or we encounter other unforeseen difficulties in the operation of our information technology systems, our operations could be disrupted, our reputation may be harmed and we could be subject to legal liability or regulatory enforcement action.\nSeveral of our businesses use, process and store proprietary information and confidential data relating to our businesses, clients and employees. Privacy laws and similar regulations in many jurisdictions where we do business, as well as customer demands, require that we take significant steps to safeguard this information. Both customer demands and legal requirements continue to evolve. We have security systems and procedures in place designed to protect against unauthorized access to such information. However, there is no guarantee that experienced computer programmers or hackers will not be able to breach our security systems and misappropriate confidential information. Breaches of our security systems could result in the loss of data or the unauthorized disclosure or misuse of confidential information of our clients or our clients' customers. This could result in harm to our reputation, damage to our systems, governmental inquiries, investigations or regulatory enforcement action, the payment of fines or other penalties, legal claims by our clients and the payment of significant remediation costs.\nWe rely on the continuous and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems to support numerous business processes and activities, to support and service our clients and to support postal services. We maintain secure systems to collect revenue for certain postal services, which is critical to enable both our systems and the postal systems to run reliably. These systems are subject to adverse acts of nature, targeted or random security breaches, cyber-attacks, computer viruses, vandalism, power loss, computer or communications failures and other unexpected events. We have disaster recovery plans in place to protect our business operations in case of such events; however, there can be no guarantee that these plans will function as designed. If our information technology systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we could be prevented from fulfilling orders and servicing clients and postal services. Also, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace these systems, and could suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our operations.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers and outsource providers and our business could be adversely affected if we fail to manage these constituents effectively.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers and outsource providers for a variety of services, components and supplies, including a large portion of our product manufacturing and some non-core functions and operations. In certain instances, we rely on single-sourced or limited-sourced suppliers and outsourcing vendors around the world because doing so is advantageous due to quality, price or lack of alternative sources. If production or services were interrupted and we were not able to find alternate third-party suppliers, we could experience disruptions in manufacturing and operations including product shortages, higher freight costs and re-engineering costs. If outsourcing services were interrupted, not performed, or the performance was poor, our ability to process, record and report transactions with our clients and other constituents could be impacted. Such interruptions in the provision of supplies and/or services could impact our ability to meet client demand, damage our reputation and client relationships and adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nCapital market disruptions and credit rating downgrades could adversely affect our ability to provide financing services to our clients and to fund various discretionary priorities, including business investments, acquisitions and dividend payments.\nWe fund our financing activities with a combination of cash generated from operations, deposits held in the Bank and access to the U.S. capital markets to facilitate short and long-term borrowings. Our ability to access the U.S. capital markets and the cost associated with our funding activities is dependent on our credit ratings and market volatility.\nA credit ratings downgrade, material capital market disruptions, significant withdrawals by depositors at the Bank, adverse changes to our industrial loan charter or a significant decline in cash flow could impact our ability to provide competitive finance offerings to our clients. In addition, if such events occurred, there can be no assurance that liquidity funding sources would be available or sufficient and that related costs would not adversely impact our ability to fund various discretionary priorities, including business investments, acquisitions and dividend payments.\nThe loss of any of the company\u2019s largest clients or business partners in our DCS segment could have a material adverse effect on the segment.\nThe DCS segment is dependent on a relatively small number of significant clients and business partners for a large portion of its revenue. The loss of any of these larger clients or business partners, or a substantial reduction in their use of our products or services, could have a material adverse effect on the revenue and profitability of the segment. There can be no assurance that our larger clients and business partners will continue to utilize our products or services at current levels, or that we would be able to replace any of these clients or business partners with others who can generate revenue at current levels.\nOur inability to obtain and protect our intellectual property and defend against claims of infringement by others may negatively impact our operating results.\nWe rely on copyright, trade secret, patent and other intellectual property laws to establish and protect proprietary rights that are important to our business. If we fail to enforce our intellectual property rights, our business may suffer. We, our clients, or our suppliers, may be subject to third-party claims of infringement on intellectual property rights. These claims, if successful, may require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain products.\nIf we fail to comply with government contracting regulations, our operating results, brand name and reputation could suffer.\nWe have a significant number of contracts with governmental entities. Government contracts are subject to extensive and complex procurement laws and regulations, along with regular audits of contract pricing and our business practices by government agencies. If we are found to have violated some provisions of these contracts, we could be required to provide a refund, pay significant damages, or be subject to contract cancellation, civil or criminal penalties, fines or debarment from doing business with the government. Any of these events could not only affect us financially, but also adversely affect our brand and reputation.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of strategic acquisitions and divestitures, which may harm our financial results.\nAs we increase our focus towards providing more digital technology and software solutions while maintaining a leadership role in the mailing industry, we may make strategic acquisitions or divest certain businesses. These acquisitions and divestitures may involve significant risks and uncertainties, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results, including:\n\u2022\nthe loss of key employees or clients of businesses acquired or divested;\n\u2022\nsignificant charges to earnings for employee severance and other restructuring costs, goodwill and asset impairments and legal, accounting and financial advisory fees;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated benefits or synergies from acquisitions and divestitures;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations, including combining product and service offerings and entering new markets, or reducing fixed costs previously associated with divested businesses; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in identifying and separating intellectual property to be divested from intellectual property we wish to keep.\nIf we are not successful at realizing the anticipated benefits of strategic acquisitions and divestitures, our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nOur operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities, litigation and violations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection and health and safety laws governing, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials;\n\u2022\nemissions or discharges of substances into the environment;\n\u2022\nthe cleanup of contaminated sites;\n\u2022\nsubstances that may be subject to regulation in the manufacture, distribution, use or disposal of our products; and\n\u2022\nthe health and safety of our employees.\nEnvironmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. If we are found to have violated these laws, we could be fined, criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. In addition, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. Certain environmental laws can assess liability on contaminated sites retroactively, on a joint and several basis, and without any finding of noncompliance or fault. From time to time, we may be involved in litigation over these issues. The amount and timing of costs under environmental laws are difficult to predict and there can be no assurance that these costs will not materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur investment in rebranding the company and enhancing marketing programs to build the market awareness necessary to create demand for our businesses may not result in increased revenue and could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur new brand strategy and identity are important to the next phase of our global business transformation. Our phased roll-out of the new branding is integrated into the way we sell and service clients, including sales collateral and the digital experience of getting information, service performance and transacting on our website. These factors are important to maintaining acceptance of our products and services by our existing clients and achieving increased acceptance with new clients. We expect increased spending in brand development and marketing promotion activities and if this increased spending does not result in increased revenue sufficient to offset these expenses, our profitability could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 24459, "SIC": 3579, "TIC": "PBI"}
