{"cik": "1344596", "company": "American Railcar Industries, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A: Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d above. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and those discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that are currently deemed immaterial may also adversely affect our business operations. If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We undertake no obligations to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nThe highly cyclical nature of the railcar industry may result in lower revenues during economic downturns or due to other factors.\nThe North American railcar market has been, and we expect it to continue to be, highly cyclical resulting in volatility in demand for our products and services. Sales of our railcars and other products slowed in 2010 resulting in decreased production rates. New orders and shipments of railcars steadily increased beginning in 2011 and continuing through 2014 driven by increased demand for shipment of certain commodities, replacement of older railcars and federal tax benefits from the delivery of railcars in 2011 through 2014. Though we have seen improvements in certain railcar markets in recent years, these improvements may or may not continue. Potential regulatory changes related to tank railcars in North America may impact future new railcar production rates and orders from our customers, as well as require retrofit and maintenance work to existing railcars. However, we cannot assure you that hopper or tank railcar demand will continue at strong levels, that demand for any railcar types will improve, or that our railcar orders and shipments will track industry-wide trends. Similarly, we cannot assure you of the scope, timing or impact of any potential regulatory changes affecting the North American railcar industry. The cyclical nature of the railcar industry may result in lower revenues during economic or industry downturns due to decreased demand for both new and replacement railcars and railcar products and lower demand for railcars on lease. Decreased demand could result in lower lease volumes, increased downtime, reduced lease rates and decreased cash flow.\nCurrently, we estimate that approximately 69.4% of our December 31, 2014 backlog will be shipped during 2015. Our failure to obtain new orders could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Downturns in part or all of the railcar manufacturing industry may occur in the future, resulting in decreased demand for our products and services. For example, a change in environmental regulations, competitive pricing, pipeline capacity and other factors could\ntrigger a cyclical shift and could reduce demand for railcars in the energy transportation industry. Additionally, reductions in oil prices may result in reduced production of domestic oil, thus driving down demand for our tank railcars that service the crude oil industry. If we fail to manage our overhead costs and variations in production rates, our business could suffer.\nFurther, a change in our product mix due to cyclical shifts in demand could have an adverse effect on our profitability. We manufacture, lease and repair a variety of railcars. The demand for specific types of these railcars varies from time to time. These shifts in demand could affect our margins and could have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nExposure to fluctuations in commodity and energy prices may impact our results of operations.\nFluctuations in commodity or energy prices, including crude oil and gas prices, could negatively impact the activities of our customers resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on the demand for our products and services. These shifts in demand could affect our results of operations and could have an adverse effect on our profitability. Changes in environmental or governmental regulations, pipeline capacity, the price of crude oil and gas and related products and other factors could reduce demand for railcars in the energy transportation industry, including our primary railcar products, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in highly competitive industries and we may be unable to compete successfully, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face intense competition in all geographic markets and in each area of our business. In our railcar manufacturing business we have five primary competitors. Any of these competitors may, from time to time, have greater resources than we do. Our current competitors have and may continue to increase their capacity in, or new competitors may enter into, the railcar markets in which we compete. Strong competition within the industry has led to pricing pressures and could limit our ability to maintain or increase prices or obtain better margins on our railcars. If we produce any type of railcars other than what we currently produce, we will be competing with other manufacturers that may have more experience with that railcar type. Further, new competitors, or alliances among existing competitors, may emerge in the railcar or industrial components industries and rapidly gain market share. Customer selection of railcars for purchase or for lease may be driven by technological or price factors, and our competitors may provide or be able to provide more technologically advanced railcars or more attractive pricing and/or lease rates than we can provide. Such competitive factors may adversely affect our sales, utilization and/or lease rates, and consequently our revenues.\nWe also have intense competition in our railcar leasing business from railcar manufacturers, leasing companies, banks and other financial institutions. Some of this competition includes certain of our significant customers, including ARL. Some of our railcar manufacturing competitors also produce railcars for use in their own railcar leasing fleets, competing directly with our railcar leasing business and with leasing companies. In connection with the re-leasing of railcars, we may encounter competition from, among other things, other railcars managed by ARL and other competitor railcar leasing companies.\nWe compete with numerous companies in our railcar services business, ranging from companies with greater resources than we have to smaller companies. In addition, new competitors, or alliances among existing competitors, may emerge, thereby intensifying the existing competition for our railcar services business.\nTechnological innovation by any of our existing competitors, or new competitors entering any of the markets in which we do business, could put us at a competitive disadvantage and could cause us to lose market share. Increased competition for our manufacturing, railcar leasing or railcar services businesses could result in price reductions, reduced margins and loss of market share, which could materially adversely affect our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe variable needs of our railcar customers and the timing of completion, customer acceptance and shipment of orders may cause our revenues and income from operations to vary substantially each quarter, which could result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results.\nRailcar sales comprised approximately 73.7%, 79.5% and 79.7% of our total consolidated revenues in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our results of operations in any particular quarterly period may be significantly affected by the number and type of railcars manufactured and shipped in that period, which is impacted by customer needs that vary greatly year to year. In addition, because revenues and earnings related to leased railcars are recognized over the life of the lease, our quarterly results may vary depending on the mix of lease versus direct sale railcars that we ship during a given period. The customer acceptance and title transfer or customer acceptance and shipment of our railcars determines when we record the revenues associated with our railcar sales or leases. Given this, the timing of customer acceptance and title transfer or customer acceptance and shipment of our railcars could cause fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results. The railroads could potentially go on strike or have other service interruptions, which could ultimately create a bottleneck and potentially cause us to slow down or halt our\nshipment and production schedules, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of these fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our sales and operating results between quarterly periods within the same year and between quarterly periods within different years may not be meaningful and, as such, these comparisons should not be relied upon as indicators of our future performance.\nIf we face labor shortages or increased labor costs, our growth and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe depend on skilled labor in our manufacturing and other businesses. Due to the competitive nature of the labor markets in which we operate and the cyclical nature of the railcar industry, the resulting employment cycle increases our risk of not being able to retain, recruit and train the personnel we require, particularly when the economy expands, production rates are high or competition for such skilled labor increases. Our inability to recruit, retain and train adequate numbers of qualified personnel on a timely basis could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend upon a small number of customers that represent a large percentage of our revenues. The loss of any single significant customer, a reduction in sales to any such significant customer or any such significant customer's inability to pay us in a timely manner could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRailcars are typically sold pursuant to large, periodic orders, and therefore, a limited number of customers typically represent a significant percentage of our revenue in any given year. For example, our top ten customers represented approximately 75.4%, 81.2% and 83.4% of our total consolidated revenues in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Moreover, our top three customers accounted for approximately 54.5%, 64.2% and 67.4% of our total consolidated revenues in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The loss of any significant portion of our sales to any major customer, the loss of a single major customer or a material adverse change in the financial condition of any one of our major customers could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If one of our significant customers was unable to pay due to financial condition, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe cost of raw materials and components that we use in our manufacturing operations, particularly steel, is subject to escalation and surcharges and could increase. Any increase in these costs or delivery delays of these raw materials could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe cost of raw materials, including steel, and components used in the production of our railcars, represents more than half of our direct manufacturing costs per railcar. We generally include provisions in our railcar manufacturing orders that allow us to adjust prices as a result of increases and decreases in the cost of most raw materials and components on a dollar for dollar basis. The number of customers to which we are not able to pass on price increases may increase in the future, which could adversely affect our operating margins and cash flows. If we are not able to pass on price increases to our customers, we may lose railcar orders or enter into contracts with less favorable contract terms, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any fluctuations in the price or availability of steel, or any other material or component used in the production of our railcars or our railcar or industrial components, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such price increases could reduce demand for our railcars or component products. Deliveries of raw materials and components may also fluctuate depending on various factors including supply and demand for the raw material or component, or governmental regulation relating to the raw material or component, including regulation relating to importation.\nFluctuations in the supply of components and raw materials we use in manufacturing railcars, which are often only available from a limited number of suppliers, could cause production delays or reductions in the number of railcars we manufacture, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur railcar manufacturing business depends on the adequate supply of numerous railcar components, such as railcar wheels, axles, brakes, bearings, yokes, sideframes, bolsters and other heavy castings and raw materials, such as steel. Some of these components and raw materials are only available from a limited number of domestic suppliers. Strong demand can cause industry-wide shortages of many critical components and raw materials as reliable suppliers could reach capacity production levels. Supply constraints in our industry are exacerbated because, although multiple suppliers may produce certain components, railcar manufacturing regulations and the physical capabilities of manufacturing facilities restrict the types and sizes of components and raw materials that manufacturers may use.\nU.S., Canadian and railroad industry regulatory authorities are currently considering various proposals concerning tank railcar manufacturing standards. We are unable to predict what regulatory changes may be made in this regard, if any, or the time period during which any such regulatory changes may become effective. However, if new regulations are adopted, they could\nmaterially impact the tank railcar manufacturing process industry-wide, which could negatively affect the potential availability of certain critical components and raw materials including, in particular, steel. If we are unable to source critical components and raw materials such as steel in a timely manner and at reasonable cost, we may be unable to manufacture railcars that comply with any new regulations and/or to take advantage of any increase in demand for our products and services as a result of any such new regulations, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, we do not carry significant inventories of certain components and procure most of our components on an as needed basis. In the event that our suppliers of railcar components and raw materials were to stop or reduce the production of railcar components and raw materials that we use, or refuse to do business with us for any reason, our business would be disrupted. Our inability to obtain components and raw materials in required quantities or of acceptable quality could result in significant delays or reductions in railcar shipments and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2014, our top three suppliers accounted for approximately 41.0% of the total materials that we purchased and our top ten suppliers accounted for approximately 69.8% of the total materials that we purchased. If any of our significant suppliers of railcar components were to shut down operations, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected as we may incur substantial delays and significant expense in finding alternative sources. The quality and reliability of alternative sources may not be the same and these alternative sources may charge significantly higher prices.\nVolatility in the global financial markets may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nDuring periods of volatility in the global financial markets, certain of our customers could delay or otherwise reduce their purchases of railcars and other products and services. If volatile conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers' access to credit, product order volumes may decrease or customers may default on payments owed to us. Some of the end users of our railcars that we sell acquire them through leasing arrangements with our leasing company customers. Economic conditions that result in higher interest rates may result in stricter borrowing conditions that could increase the cost of, or potentially deter, new leasing arrangements. These factors may cause our customers to purchase or lease fewer railcars, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe railcars in our lease fleet consist of tank railcars and hopper railcars. The lessees of such types of railcars have historically been concentrated for use in certain industries and products and our lessees generally reflect such industry concentrations. Consequently, any significant economic downturn in these industries could have a material adverse effect on the creditworthiness of the lessees in these industries and on the ability of such lessees to pay rent under the leases, as well as on our ability to re-lease railcars to those lessees, or to other potential lessees with a need for railcars of the types we operate.\nIf our suppliers face challenges obtaining credit, selling their products, or otherwise operating their businesses, the supply of materials we purchase from them to manufacture our products may be interrupted. Any of these conditions or events could result in reductions in our revenues, increased price competition, or increased operating costs, which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nCompanies affiliated with Mr. Carl Icahn are important to our business.\nWe manufacture railcars and railcar components and provide railcar services for companies affiliated with Mr. Carl Icahn, our principal beneficial stockholder through IELP. We are currently subject to agreements, and may enter into additional agreements, with certain of these affiliates that are important to our business. To the extent our relationships with affiliates of Mr. Carl Icahn change due to the sale of his interest in us, such affiliates or otherwise, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nAffiliates of Mr. Carl Icahn accounted for approximately 36.1%, 35.7% and 17.5% of our consolidated revenues in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. This revenue is primarily attributable to sale of railcars to ARL and AEP, which currently purchase all of their railcars from us, but are not required to do so in the future. This revenue is also attributable to railcar repairs and services provided to ARL, which are done on an ad hoc basis. Further, ARI is not the only provider of railcar repairs and services to ARL. This revenue is also generated from a purchasing and engineering services agreement and license with ACF, under which we provide purchasing support and engineering services to ACF in connection with ACF's manufacture and sale of certain tank railcars at its facility. To the extent our relationships with ARL, ACF or Mr. Carl Icahn change, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe operate our leasing business under lease management agreements with ARL through which ARL markets our railcars for sale or lease and acts as our manager to lease railcars on our behalf for a fee. ARL also leases railcars on behalf of itself, its subsidiaries and other third parties, and therefore markets our railcars and railcars owned by others to the same customer base.\nOur management agreements with ARL contain provisions that require ARL to treat railcars owned by us and our subsidiaries in the same manner as railcars owned by ARL or other third parties for which ARL serves as manager. However, ARL may provide a leasing customer with railcars owned by others, instead of our railcars, based on a number of factors, such as customers' timing or geographic needs or other specifications.\nMr. Carl Icahn exerts significant influence over us and his interests may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nMr. Carl Icahn controls approximately 56% of the voting power of our common stock, through IELP, and is able to control or exert substantial influence over us, including the election of our directors and controlling most matters requiring board or stockholder approval, including business strategies, mergers, business combinations, acquisitions or dispositions of significant assets, issuances of common stock, incurrence of debt or other financing and the payment of dividends. The existence of a controlling stockholder may have the effect of making it difficult for, or may discourage or delay, a third party from seeking to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock, which could adversely affect the market price of our stock.\nMr. Carl Icahn owns, controls and has an interest in a wide array of companies, some of which, such as ARL, AEP and ACF as described above, may compete directly or indirectly with us. As a result, his interests may not always be consistent with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders. For example, ARL competes directly with some of our customers and with us in the railcar leasing business. ACF has also previously manufactured railcars for us and under a purchasing and engineering services agreement and license is manufacturing and selling tank railcars with engineering, purchasing and design support from us. Mr. Carl Icahn and entities controlled by him may also pursue acquisitions or business opportunities that may be complementary to our business. Our articles of incorporation allow Mr. Carl Icahn, entities controlled by him, and any director, officer, member, partner, stockholder or employee of Mr. Carl Icahn or entities controlled by him, to take advantage of such corporate opportunities without first presenting such opportunities to us, unless such opportunities are expressly offered to any such party solely in, and as a direct result of, his or her capacity as our director, officer or employee. As a result, corporate opportunities that may benefit us may not be available to us in a timely manner, or at all. To the extent that conflicts of interest may arise among us, Mr. Carl Icahn and his affiliates, those conflicts may be resolved in a manner adverse to us or you.\nWe may be unable to re-market railcars from expiring leases on favorable terms, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe failure to enter into commercially favorable railcar leases, re-lease or sell railcars upon lease expiration and successfully manage existing leases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to re-lease or sell leased railcars profitably is dependent upon several factors, including the cost of and demand for leases or ownership of newer or specific use models, and the availability in the market of other used or new railcars.\nA downturn in the industries in which our lessees operate and decreased demand for railcars could also increase our exposure to re-marketing risk because lessees may demand shorter lease terms, requiring us to re-market leased railcars more frequently. Furthermore, the resale market for previously leased railcars has a limited number of potential buyers. Our inability to re-lease or sell leased railcars on favorable terms could result in lower lease rates, lower lease utilization percentages and reduced revenues.\nOur investment in our lease fleet may use significant amounts of cash, which may require us to secure additional capital and we may be unable to arrange capital on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe utilize existing cash and cash generated through lease fleet financings to manufacture railcars we lease to customers, while cash from lease revenues will be received over the term of the lease or leases relating to those railcars. Depending upon the number of railcars that we lease and the amount of cash used in other operations, our cash balances and our availability under any of our lease fleet financings could be depleted, requiring us to seek additional capital. Our inability to secure additional capital, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, may limit our ability to support operations, maintain or expand our existing business, or take advantage of new business opportunities. We could also experience defaults on leases that could further constrain cash.\nTrain derailments or other accidents involving our products could subject us to legal claims and/or result in regulatory changes that may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe manufacture railcars for our customers to transport a variety of commodities, including railcars that transport hazardous materials such as crude oil and other petroleum products. We also manufacture railcar components as well as industrial components for use in several markets, including the trucking, construction, mining and oil and gas exploration markets. We could be subject to various legal claims, including claims for negligence, personal injury, physical damage and product liability,\nas well as potential penalties and liability under environmental laws and regulations, in the event of a train derailment or other accident involving our products or services. If we become subject to any such claims and are unable successfully to resolve them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRecent derailments in North America of trains transporting crude oil have caused various U.S and Canadian regulatory agencies, industry organizations, as well as Class I Railroads and community governments, to focus attention on transportation by rail of flammable materials. For example, in April 2014, Transport Canada (TC), a federal department of the Canadian government that regulates rail transportation and safety within Canada, issued a protective order mandating that tank railcars with certain specifications must no longer transport certain designated dangerous goods, including certain flammable liquids, within Canada. In addition, in July 2014, TC proposed regulations that would impose stricter safety standards for certain newly manufactured tank railcars operating in Canada. Similarly, in July 2014, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) issued proposed regulations that could affect federal tank railcar design and construction standards for new tank railcars used to transport crude oil and other flammable products. The PHMSA may adopt the proposed regulations or may adopt other proposals based on the comments received on the proposed regulations. In addition, railroads and other organizations may impose requirements for railcars that are more stringent than, or in addition to, any governmental regulations that may be adopted.\nWe are unable to predict what regulatory or other changes may be made in light of these or other proposals, if any, or the time period during which any such regulatory or other changes may become effective. Final regulatory changes have been delayed and may continue to be delayed. As a result, certain customers may be delaying further inquiries for tank railcars for crude and ethanol service until such regulations are finalized. Any final requirements may or may not materially impact the rail industry as a whole; railroad operations; older and newer railcars that meet or exceed currently mandated standards; future railcar specifications; and the capability of the North American railcar manufacturing, repair and maintenance infrastructure to implement mandated retrofit configurations or new construction. Further, the potential impact on the railcars and components we manufacture, as well as railcars that we lease, is not known at this time. As a result of such proposed regulations, certain of our railcars could be deemed unfit for further commercial use (which would diminish or eliminate future revenue generated from leased railcars) and/or require retrofits or modifications. The costs associated with any required retrofits or modifications could be substantial. While certain regulatory changes could result in increased demand for refurbishment and/or new railcar manufacturing activity, if we are unable to adapt our business to changing regulations or railroad standards, and/or take advantage of any increase in demand for our products and services, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We cannot assure that costs incurred to comply with any new standards and regulations, including any emerging from PHMSA's or TC's rulemaking processes, will not be material to our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIncreasing insurance claims and expenses could lower profitability and increase business risk.\nThe nature of our business subjects us to product liability, property damage, and personal injury claims, especially in connection with the manufacture, repair or other servicing of products or components that are used in the transport or handling of hazardous, toxic, or volatile materials. We maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liability claims and liability insurance coverage at levels based upon commercial norms in the industries in which we operate and our historical claims experience. Over the last several years, insurance carriers have raised premiums for many companies operating in our industries. Increased insurance premiums may further increase our insurance expense as coverages expire or cause us to raise our self-insured retention. If the number or severity of claims within our self-insured retention increases, we could suffer costs in excess of our reserves. An unusually large liability claim or a series of claims based on a failure repeated throughout our mass production process may exceed our insurance coverage or result in direct damages if we were unable or elected not to insure against certain hazards because of high premiums or other reasons. In addition, the availability of, and our ability to collect on, insurance coverage is often subject to factors beyond our control. Moreover, any accident or incident involving us, even if we are fully insured or not held to be liable, could negatively affect our reputation among customers and the public, thereby making it more difficult for us to compete effectively, and could materially adversely affect the cost and availability of insurance in the future.\nLitigation claims could increase our costs and weaken our financial condition.\nWe are currently, and may from time to time be, involved in various claims or legal proceedings arising out of our operations. In particular, railcars we manufacture and lease will be utilized in a variety of manners, which may include carrying hazardous, flammable, and/or corrosive materials. Such railcars, as well as our railcar and industrial components, will, therefore, be subject to risks of breakdowns, malfunctions, casualty and other negative events and it is possible that claims for personal injury, loss of life, property damage, business losses and other liability arising out of these or other types of incidents will be made against us. Additionally, in our normal course of business from time to time we enter into contracts with third parties that may lead to contractual disputes. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these matters could result in judgments against us for significant\nmonetary damages that could increase our costs and weaken our financial condition. We seek contractual recourse and indemnification in the ordinary course of business, maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liability, and purchase liability insurance at coverage levels based upon commercial norms in our industries in an effort to mitigate our liability exposures. Nevertheless, our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of claims or judgments. Any such claims or judgments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The nature of our businesses and assets expose us to the potential for claims and litigation related to personal injury, property damage, environmental claims, regulatory claims, contractual disputes and various other matters.\nThe success of our railcar leasing business is dependent, in part, on our lessees performing their obligations.\nThe ability of each lessee to perform its obligations under a lease will depend primarily on such lessee's financial condition. The financial condition of a lessee may be affected by various factors beyond our control, including competition, operating costs, general economic conditions and environmental and other governmental regulation of or affecting the lessee's industry. High default rates on leases could increase the portion of railcars that may need to be remarketed after repossession from defaulting lessees. There can be no assurance that the historical default experience with respect to our lease fleet will continue in the future.\nThe level of our reported railcar backlog may not necessarily indicate what our future revenues will be and our actual revenues may fall short of the estimated revenue value attributed to our railcar backlog.\nWe define backlog as the number of railcars to which our customers have committed in writing to purchase or lease from us that have not been shipped. The estimated backlog value in dollars is the anticipated revenue on the railcars included in the backlog for purchase and the estimated fair market value of the railcars included in the backlog for lease, though actual revenues for these leases are recognized pursuant to the terms of each lease. Our competitors may not define railcar backlog in the same manner as we do, which could make comparisons of our railcar backlog with theirs misleading. Customer orders may be subject to requests for delays in deliveries, inspection rights and other customary industry terms and conditions, which could prevent or delay our railcar backlog from being converted into revenues. Our reported railcar backlog may not be converted into revenues in any particular period, if at all, and the actual revenues from such sales may not equal our reported estimates of railcar backlog value.\nOur failure to comply with laws and regulations imposed by federal, state, local and foreign agencies could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to access capital.\nThe industries in which we operate are subject to extensive regulation by governmental, regulatory and industry authorities and by federal, state, local and foreign agencies. The risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to compliance with these laws and regulations are an inherent part of our business. Despite our intention to comply with these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so at all times and compliance may prove to be more costly and limiting than we currently anticipate and could increase in future years. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and may become more stringent over time, which could impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to access capital. If we fail to comply with the requirements and regulations of these agencies that impact our manufacturing, other processes and reporting requirements, we may face sanctions and penalties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to access capital.\nUncertainty surrounding acceptance of our new product offerings by our customers, and costs associated with those new offerings, could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur strategy depends in part on our continued development and sale of new products, particularly new railcar designs, in order to expand or maintain our market share in our current and new markets. Any new or modified product design that we develop may not gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace and any such product may not be able to compete successfully with existing or new product designs that may be introduced by our competitors. Furthermore, we may experience significant initial costs of production of new products, particularly railcar products, related to training, labor and operating inefficiencies. To the extent that the total costs of production significantly exceed our anticipated costs of production, we may incur losses on the sale of any new products.\nEquipment failures, delays in deliveries or extensive damage to our facilities, particularly our railcar manufacturing plants in Paragould or Marmaduke, Arkansas, could lead to production or service curtailments or shutdowns.\nAn interruption in manufacturing capabilities at our railcar plants in Paragould or Marmaduke or at any of our manufacturing facilities, whether as a result of equipment failure or any other reason, could reduce, prevent or delay production of our railcars or railcar and industrial components, which could alter the scheduled delivery dates to our customers and affect our production schedule. This could result in the termination of orders, the loss of future sales and a negative impact to our reputation with our\ncustomers and in the railcar industry, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAll of our facilities and equipment are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events, such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornados or weather conditions. If there is a natural disaster or other serious disruption at any of our facilities, we may experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of equipment failures, loss of power, delays in equipment deliveries, or extensive damage to any of our facilities, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur mobile units and mini shop facilities may expose us to additional risks that may materially adversely affect our business.\nOur mobile units and mini shop repair facilities are available to assist customers in quickly resolving railcar maintenance issues and services may be performed on a customer's property, thereby increasing our susceptibility to liability. Additionally, the resources available to employees to assist in providing services out of these facilities are less than what is available at a full repair facility. The effects of these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to complete capital expenditure projects on time and within budget, or the failure of these projects, once constructed, to operate as anticipated could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConstruction plans we may have from time to time are subject to a number of risks and contingencies over which we may have little control and that may adversely affect the cost and timing of the completion of those projects, or the capacity or efficiencies of those projects once constructed. If these capital expenditure projects do not achieve the results anticipated, we may not be able to satisfy our operational goals on a timely basis, if at all. If we are unable to complete the construction of any of such capital expenditure projects on time or within budget, or if those projects do not achieve the capacity or efficiencies anticipated, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur relationships with our joint ventures could be unsuccessful, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe have entered into joint venture agreements with other companies to increase our sourcing alternatives and reduce costs. We may seek to expand our relationships or enter into new agreements with other companies. If our joint venture partners are unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or if these relationships are otherwise not successful in the future, our manufacturing costs could increase, we could encounter production disruptions, growth opportunities could fail to materialize, or we could be required to fund such joint ventures in amounts significantly greater than initially anticipated, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf any of our joint ventures generate significant losses, it could adversely affect our results of operations. For example, if our Axis joint venture is unable to operate as anticipated, incurs significant losses or otherwise is unable to honor its obligation to us under the Axis loan, our financial results or financial position could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may pursue new joint ventures, acquisitions or new business endeavors that involve inherent risks, any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits and we may have difficulty integrating the operations of any joint ventures that we form, companies that we acquire or new business endeavors, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully identify suitable joint venture, acquisition or new business endeavor opportunities or complete any particular joint venture, acquisition, business combination, other transaction or new business endeavors on acceptable terms. Our identification of suitable joint venture opportunities, acquisition candidates and new business endeavors and the integration of new and acquired business operations involve risks inherent in assessing the values, strengths, weaknesses, risks and profitability of these opportunities. This includes their effects on our business, diversion of our management's attention and risks associated with unanticipated problems or unforeseen liabilities. These issues may require significant financial resources that could otherwise be used for the ongoing development of our current operations.\nThe difficulties of integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations, integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures. These difficulties could be further increased to the extent we pursue opportunities internationally or in new markets where we do not have significant experience. In addition, we may not be effective in retaining key employees or customers of the combined businesses. We may face integration issues pertaining to the internal controls and operations functions of the acquired companies and we may not realize cost efficiencies or synergies that we anticipated when selecting our acquisition candidates. In addition, we may\nexperience managerial or other conflicts with our joint venture partners. Any of these items could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur failure to identify suitable joint venture, acquisition opportunities or new business endeavors may restrict our ability to grow our business. If we are successful in pursuing such opportunities, we may be required to expend significant funds, incur additional debt or issue additional securities, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and be dilutive to our stockholders. If we spend significant funds or incur additional debt, our ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could decline and we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures.\nThe price of our common stock is subject to volatility.\nThe market price for our common stock has varied between a high closing sales price of $82.22 per share and a low closing sales price of $30.39 per share in the past twenty-four months as of December 31, 2014. This volatility may affect the price at which our common stock could be sold. In addition, the broader stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and may adversely affect the price of our common stock. The price for our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including the other factors discussed in these risk factors.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of their stock, many companies have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we became involved in securities class action litigation in the future, it could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management's attention and resources and could harm our stock price, business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nVarious other factors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially, including financial market and general economic changes, changes in governmental regulation, significant railcar industry announcements or developments, the introduction of new products or technologies by us or our competitors, and changes in other conditions or trends in our industry or in the markets of any of our significant customers.\nOther factors that could cause our stock's price to fluctuate could be actual or anticipated variations in our or our competitors' quarterly or annual financial results, financial results failing to meet expectations of analysts or investors, including the level of our backlog and number of orders received during the period, changes in securities analysts' estimates of our future performance or of that of our competitors and the general health and outlook of our industry.\nRisks related to our activities or potential activities outside of the U.S. and any potential expansion into new geographic markets could adversely affect our results of operations.\nConducting business outside the U.S. subjects us to various risks, including changing economic, legal and political conditions, work stoppages, exchange controls, currency fluctuations, terrorist activities directed at U.S. companies, armed conflicts and unexpected changes in the U.S. and the laws of other countries relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, transportation regulations, foreign investments and taxation. Some foreign countries in which we operate have regulatory authorities that regulate railroad safety, railcar design and railcar component part design, performance and manufacturing.\nIn addition, changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers, more stringent rules relating to labor or the environment, adverse tax consequences and price exchange controls could make the manufacturing and distribution of our products internationally more difficult. The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial penalties and fines. Any international expansion or acquisition that we undertake could heighten these risks related to operating outside of the U.S.\nWe are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and the cost of complying, or our failure to comply, with such requirements could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment; the management, use, processing, handling, storage, transport or disposal of hazardous materials; or otherwise relating to the protection of public and employee health, safety and the environment. These laws and regulations expose us to liability for the environmental condition of our current or formerly owned or operated facilities, and may expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for our actions that complied with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken. They may also expose us to liability for claims of personal injury or property damage related to alleged exposure to hazardous or toxic materials. Despite our intention to be in compliance, we cannot guarantee that we will at all times comply with such requirements. The cost of complying with these requirements may also increase substantially in future\nyears. If we violate or fail to comply with these requirements, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. In addition, these requirements are complex, change frequently and may become more stringent over time, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to maintain and comply with environmental permits that we are required to maintain could result in fines, penalties or other sanctions and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Future events, such as new environmental regulations, changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies, newly discovered information or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards of products or business activities, may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we lose any of our executive officers or key employees, our operations and ability to manage the day-to-day aspects of our business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur future performance will substantially depend on our ability to retain and motivate our executive officers and key employees, both individually and as a group. If we lose any of our executive officers or key employees, who have many years of experience with our company and within the railcar industry and other manufacturing industries, or are unable to recruit qualified personnel, our ability to manage the day-to-day aspects of our business could be materially adversely affected. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees, who also have strong personal ties with customers and suppliers, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not currently maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance. Further, we do not have employment contracts with all of our executive officers and key employees.\nOur implementation of new enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems could negatively impact our business.\nWe are currently designing and implementing an ERP system that supports substantially all of our operating and financial functions. We have experienced delays with this implementation and have terminated and filed suit against a systems implementer we hired to implement this system. Although we have hired a new systems implementer and the project is currently underway, we could experience further problems in connection with such implementation, including compatibility issues, training requirements, higher than expected implementation costs and other integration challenges and delays. A significant implementation problem, if encountered, could negatively impact our business by disrupting our operations and by extending the period of time during which we are relying on less robust systems. Additionally, a significant problem with the implementation, integration with other systems or ongoing management of an ERP system and related systems could have an adverse effect on our ability to generate and interpret accurate management and financial reports and other information on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial reporting system and internal controls and adversely affect our ability to manage our business or comply with various regulations.\nSome of our railcar services and component manufacturing employees belong to labor unions and strikes or work stoppages by them or unions formed by some or all of our other employees in the future could materially adversely affect our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the employees at our sites covered by collective bargaining agreements represent, in the aggregate, approximately 13.7% of our total workforce. Disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions in the future could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns by the affected workers. We cannot guarantee that our relations with our union workforce will remain positive nor can we guarantee that union organizers will not be successful in future attempts to organize our railcar manufacturing employees or employees at our other facilities. If our workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown, other employees were to become unionized or the terms and conditions in future labor agreements were renegotiated, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and higher ongoing labor costs. In addition, we could face higher labor costs in the future as a result of severance or other charges associated with layoffs, shutdowns or reductions in the size and scope of our operations.\nOur manufacturer's warranties expose us to potentially significant claims and our business could be harmed if our products contain undetected defects or do not meet applicable specifications.\nWe may be subject to significant warranty claims in the future relating to workmanship and materials involving our current or future railcar or component product designs. Such claims may include multiple claims based on one defect repeated throughout our mass production process or claims for which the cost of repairing the defective component is highly disproportionate to the original cost of the part. These types of warranty claims could result in costly product recalls, significant repair costs and damage to our reputation, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Unresolved warranty claims could result in users of our products bringing legal actions against us.\nFurther, if our railcars or component products are defectively designed or manufactured, are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues, contain defective components or are misused, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or others who may claim to be harmed by our products. Product liability claims could divert management's attention from our business, be expensive to defend and/or settle and result in sizable damage awards against us.\nOur indebtedness could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our indebtedness obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our total debt was $409.0 million, consisting of borrowings under the Longtrain Leasing I, LLC (LLI) and Longtrain Leasing II, LLC (LLII) lease fleet financing senior secured term loan facilities. As of the date of this report, our total debt was $623.3 million, consisting of borrowings under an indenture entered into by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Longtrain Leasing III, LLC (LLIII) in January 2015.\nOur indebtedness could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments of our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate purposes or acquisitions.\nOur inability to comply with covenants in place or our inability to make the required principal and interest payments may cause an event of default, which could have a substantial adverse impact to our business, financial condition and results of operation. In the event of a default on our LLIII lease fleet financing, the noteholders may foreclose on all or a portion of the fleet of railcars and related leases used to secure the financing, which are owned by LLIII. Such foreclosure, if a significant number of railcars or related leases are affected, could result in the loss of a significant amount of ARI's assets and adversely affect revenues.\nBoth the LLI and LLII lease fleet financings were obligations of the respective wholly-owned subsidiary, were generally non-recourse to ARI, and were secured by a first lien on the subject assets of LLI and LLII, respectively, consisting of railcars, railcar leases, receivables and related assets, subject to limited exceptions. Additionally, the LLIII lease fleet financing is an obligation of LLIII, is generally non-recourse to ARI, and is secured by a first lien on the subject assets of LLIII, consisting of railcars, railcar leases, receivables and related assets, subject to limited exceptions.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we were exposed to the risk of increasing interest rates as our lease fleet financings were at variable interest rates. Any material changes in interest rates could have resulted in higher interest expense and related payments for us. Both the LLI and LLII lease fleet financings were paid off in January 2015 when the Company used the proceeds from the issuance and sale of notes by its wholly-owned subsidiary, LLIII to pay off the prior lease fleet financings. The LLIII notes are fixed rate secured railcar equipment notes bearing interest at a rate of 2.98% per annum for the Class A-1 notes and 4.06% per annum for the Class A-2 notes. See Note 23, Subsequent Events, for further discussion regarding this refinancing and the nature of this subsidiary.\nDespite our indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt, as may our subsidiaries, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness.\nDespite our indebtedness, we may be able to incur future indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, and this debt could be substantial. If new debt is added to our or our subsidiaries' current debt levels, the related risks that we or they now face could be magnified.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our obligations and we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures, strategic transactions, joint venture capital requirements or expansion efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nOur business may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and there can be no assurance that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness as such indebtedness matures and to fund our other liquidity needs. If this is the case, we will need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We might have to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity or debt financing. These financing strategies may not be implemented on satisfactory terms, if at all. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing and to do so on commercially reasonable terms will depend on our financial condition at the time, restrictions in any agreements governing our indebtedness and other factors, including the condition of the financial markets and the railcar industry.\nIf we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and additional borrowings, refinancing or proceeds of asset sales are not available to us, we may not have sufficient cash to enable us to meet all of our obligations.\nIf ACF does not, or is unable to, honor its remedial or indemnity obligations to us regarding environmental matters, such environmental matters could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain real property we acquired from ACF in 1994 had been involved in investigation and remediation activities to address contamination both before and after their transfer to ARI. ACF is an affiliate of Mr. Carl Icahn, our principal beneficial stockholder through IELP. Substantially all of the issues identified with respect to these properties relate to the use of these properties prior to their transfer to us by ACF and for which ACF has retained liability for environmental contamination that may have existed at the time of transfer to us. ACF has also agreed to indemnify us for any cost that might be incurred with those existing issues. As of the date of this report, it is our understanding that no further investigation or remediation is required at these properties and we do not believe we will incur material costs in connection with such activities, but we cannot assure that this will be the case. If ACF fails to honor its obligations to us, we could be responsible for the cost of any additional investigation or remediation activities relating to these properties, that may be required. These additional costs could be material or could interfere with the operation of our business. Any environmental liabilities we may incur that are not covered by adequate insurance or indemnification will also increase our costs and have a negative impact on our profitability.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property and prevent its improper use by third parties, our ability to compete in the market may be harmed.\nVarious patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws afford only limited protection and may not prevent our competitors from duplicating our products or gaining access to our proprietary information and technology. These means also may not permit us to gain or maintain a competitive advantage. To the extent we expand internationally, we become subject to the risk that foreign intellectual property laws will not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as intellectual property laws in the U.S.\nAny of our patents may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful should one or more of our patents be challenged for any reason. If our patent claims are rendered invalid or unenforceable, or narrowed in scope, the patent coverage afforded our products could be impaired, which could significantly impede our ability to market our products, negatively affect our competitive position and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur pending or future patent applications may not result in an issued patent and, if patents are issued to us, such patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies. The United States federal courts may invalidate our patents or find them unenforceable. Competitors may also be able to design around our patents. Other parties may develop and obtain patent protection for more effective technologies, designs or methods. If these developments were to occur, it could have an adverse effect on our sales. If our intellectual property rights are not adequately protected we may not be able to commercialize our technologies, products or services and our competitors could commercialize our technologies, which could result in a decrease in our sales and market share and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products could infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may lead to litigation that could itself be costly, result in the payment of substantial damages or royalties, and prevent us from using technology that is essential to our products.\nWe cannot guarantee that our products, manufacturing processes or other methods do not infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Infringement and other intellectual property claims and proceedings brought against us, whether successful or not, could result in substantial costs and harm our reputation. Such claims and proceedings can also distract and divert our management and key personnel from other tasks important to the success of our business. In addition, intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\ncease selling or using any of our products that incorporate the asserted intellectual property, which would adversely affect our revenues;\n\u2022\npay substantial damages for past use of the asserted intellectual property;\n\u2022\nobtain a license from the holder of the asserted intellectual property, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all; and\n\u2022\nredesign or rename, in the case of trademark claims, our products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may be costly and time-consuming, even if possible.\nIn the event of an adverse determination in an intellectual property suit or proceeding, or our failure to license essential technology, our sales could be harmed and our costs could increase, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur investment activities are subject to risks that could materially adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we may invest in marketable securities, or derivatives thereof, including higher risk equity securities and high yield debt instruments. These securities are subject to general credit, liquidity, market risks and interest rate fluctuations that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and in the past have caused overall tightening of the credit markets and declines in the stock markets. The market risks associated with any investments we may make could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur investments at any given time also may become highly concentrated within a particular company, industry, asset category, trading style or financial or economic market. In that event, our investment portfolio will be more susceptible to fluctuations in value resulting from adverse economic conditions affecting the performance of that particular company, industry, asset category, trading style or economic market than a less concentrated portfolio would be. As a result, our investment portfolio could become concentrated and its aggregate return may be volatile and may be affected substantially by the performance of only one or a few holdings. For reasons not necessarily attributable to any of the risks set forth in this report (for example, supply/demand imbalances or other market forces), the prices of the securities in which we invest may decline substantially.\nChanges in assumptions or investment performance related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans that we sponsor could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are responsible for making funding contributions to two frozen pension plans and are liable for any unfunded liabilities that may exist should the plans be terminated. Our liability and resulting costs for these plans may increase or decrease based upon a number of factors, including actuarial assumptions used, the discount rate used in calculating the present value of future liabilities, and investment performance, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. There is no assurance that interest rates will remain constant or that our pension fund assets can earn the expected rate of return, and our actual experience may be significantly different. Our pension expenses and funding may also be greater than we currently anticipate if our assumptions regarding plan earnings and expenses turn out to be incorrect.\nWe provide certain postretirement life insurance benefits for certain of our union employees who retire after attaining specified age and service requirements. Our postretirement benefit obligations and related expense with respect to these postretirement benefits also increase or decrease based on several factors and could similarly materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations due to changes in these factors.\nWe may be required to reduce the value of our inventory, long-lived assets and/or goodwill, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be required to reduce inventory carrying values using the lower of cost or market approach in the future due to a decline in market conditions in the industries in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired. Any resulting impairment loss related to reductions in the value of our inventory, long-lived assets or our goodwill could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived assets may not be recoverable. As discussed in Note 3 and Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements, no triggering events occurred in 2014 to cause concern that our long-lived assets or goodwill would be impaired. We perform an annual goodwill impairment test as of March 1 of each year. As discussed in Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements, no goodwill impairment loss was noted in 2014. Assumptions used in our impairment tests regarding future operating results of\nour reporting units could prove to be inaccurate. This could cause an adverse change in our valuation and thus any of our long-lived assets or goodwill impairment tests may have been flawed. Any future impairment tests are subject to the same risks.\nThe use of railcars as a significant mode of transporting freight could decline, become more efficient over time, experience a shift in types of modal transportation, and/or certain railcar types could become obsolete.\nAs the freight transportation markets we serve continue to evolve and become more efficient, the use of railcars may decline in favor of other more economic modes of transportation. Features and functionality specific to certain railcar types could result in those railcars becoming obsolete as customer requirements for freight delivery change. Our operations may be adversely impacted by changes in the preferred method used by customers to ship their products or changes in demand for particular products. The industries in which our customers operate are driven by dynamic market forces and trends, which are in turn influenced by economic and political factors in the United States and abroad. Demand for our railcars may be significantly affected by changes in the markets in which our customers operate. A significant reduction in customer demand for transportation or manufacture of a particular product or change in the preferred method of transportation used by customers to ship their products could result in the economic obsolescence of our railcars, including those leased by our customers.\nOur stock price may decline due to sales of shares beneficially owned by Mr. Carl Icahn through IELP.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that these sales may occur, may materially adversely affect the price of our common stock and impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of equity securities in the future. Of our outstanding shares of common stock, approximately 56% are beneficially owned by Mr. Carl Icahn, our principal beneficial stockholder through IELP.\nCertain stockholders are contractually entitled, subject to certain exceptions, to exercise their demand registration rights to register their shares under the Securities Act of 1933. If this right is exercised, holders of any of our common stock subject to these agreements will be entitled to participate in such registration. By exercising their registration rights, and selling a large number of shares, these holders could cause the price of our common stock to decline. Approximately 11.6 million shares of common stock are covered by such registration rights.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NASDAQ Global Select Market rules and therefore we are not subject to all of the NASDAQ Global Select Market corporate governance requirements.\nAs we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the NASDAQ Global Select Market, we have elected, as permitted by those rules, not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements. For example, our board of directors does not have a majority of independent directors and we do not have a nominating committee or compensation committee consisting of independent directors. As a result, our officers' compensation is not determined by our independent directors, and director nominees are not selected or recommended by a majority of independent directors.\nPayments of cash dividends on our common stock may be made only at the discretion of our board of directors and may be restricted by North Dakota law.\nAny decision to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our operating results, strategic plans, capital requirements, financial condition, provisions of our borrowing arrangements and other factors our board of directors considers relevant. Furthermore, North Dakota law imposes restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. Accordingly, we may not be able to continue to pay dividends in any given amount in the future, or at all.\nWe are governed by the North Dakota Publicly Traded Corporations Act. Interpretation and application of this act is scarce and such lack of predictability could be detrimental to our stockholders.\nThe North Dakota Publicly Traded Corporations Act, which we are governed by, was only recently enacted and, to our knowledge, no other companies are yet subject to its provisions and interpretations of its likely application are scarce. Although the North Dakota Publicly Traded Corporations Act specifically provides that its provisions must be liberally construed to protect and enhance the rights of stockholders in publicly traded corporations, this lack of predictability could be detrimental to our stockholders.\nOur information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk including misappropriation of customer information or other breaches of information security. Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information, expose us to liability and harm our reputation and business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, personal information, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our data centers and on our networks. Our information and processes are\nexposed to the ever-changing threat of compromised security, in the form of a risk of potential breach, system failure, computer virus, or unauthorized or fraudulent use by customers, company employees, or employees of third party vendors. The steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful. Any compromise of our data security and access, public disclosure, or loss of personal or confidential business information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and customers' willingness to transact business with us, and subject us to additional costs and liabilities that could adversely affect our business.\nTerrorist attacks could negatively impact our operations and profitability and may expose us to liability.\nTerrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations. Such attacks in the past have caused uncertainty in the world financial markets and economic instability in the United States and elsewhere, and further acts of terrorism, violence or war could similarly affect world financial markets and trade, as well as the industries in which we and our customers operate. In addition, terrorist attacks or hostilities may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers, which could adversely impact our operations. These uncertainties could also adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nIt is also possible that our products, particularly railcars we produce, could be involved in a terrorist attack. Although the terms of our lease agreements require lessees to indemnify us and others against a broad spectrum of damages arising out of the use of the railcars, and we currently carry insurance to potentially offset losses in the event that customer indemnifications prove to be insufficient, we may not be fully protected from liability arising from a terrorist attack that involves our railcars. In addition, any terrorist attack involving any of our railcars may cause reputational damage, or other losses, which could materially and adversely affect our business.", "PERMNO": 91075, "SIC": 3743, "TIC": "ARII"}
