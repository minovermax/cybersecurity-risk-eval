{"cik": "1506492", "company": "Sunshine Heart, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business faces many risks. We believe the risks described below are the material risks we face. However, the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional unknown risks or risks that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our shares of common stock could decline significantly. Investors should consider the specific risk factors discussed below, together with the \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other documents that we will file from time to time with the SEC.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have limited history of operations and limited experience in sales and marketing, and we might be unsuccessful in increasing our sales and cannot assure you that we will ever generate substantial revenue or be profitable.\nPrior to our acquisition of the Aquadex FlexFlow in August 2016, we did not have a product approved for commercial sale and focused our resources on developing, manufacturing and commercializing our C-Pulse System. On September 29, 2016, we announced a strategic refocus of our near-term strategy that includes halting all clinical evaluations to fully focus our resources on our recently acquired Aquadex FlexFlow, taking actions to reduce our cash burn in connection with such strategic refocus and reviewing potential strategic alliances and financing alternatives. Our business strategy depends in part on our ability to grow our Aquadex Business by establishing a sales force, selling our products to hospitals and other healthcare facilities and controlling costs all of which we may be unable to do. We have no prior experience with respect to manufacturing, sales and marketing. If we are unsuccessful at manufacturing, marketing and selling our Aquadex FlexFlow, our operations and potential revenues will be materially adversely affected.\nWe have incurred operating losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur operating losses in the near-term. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm issued in connection with its audit of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We will need additional funding to continue operations, which may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all.\nWe are an early-stage company with a history of incurring net losses. We have incurred net losses since our inception, including net losses of $15.8 million and $26.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, our accumulated deficit was $169.0 million.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm issued in connection with its audit of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Prior to August 2016, we did not have any products approved for commercialization, generated only limited revenue from our clinical studies and had significant operating losses as we incurred costs associated with the conduct of clinical studies and our research and development programs for our C-Pulse System. We became a revenue generating company only a few months ago after acquiring the Aquadex Business in August 2016. We expect to incur additional losses in the near-term as we grow the Aquadex Business, including investments in expanding our sales and marketing capabilities, purchasing inventory, manufacturing components, and complying with the requirements related to being a U.S. public company listed on NASDAQ. To become and remain profitable, we must succeed in expanding the adoption and market acceptance of the Aquadex FlexFlow. This will require us to succeed in a range of challenging activities, including training personnel at hospitals and effectively and efficiently manufacturing, marketing and distributing the Aquadex FlexFlow and related components. There can be no assurance that we will succeed in these activities, and we may never generate revenues sufficient to achieve profitability. If we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain it.\nWe expect to require additional funding to grow our Aquadex Business, which may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. In addition, the risk that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may make it more difficult to obtain necessary additional funding on terms favorable to us, or at all. We expect to seek additional financing during 2017. If we raise additional funding through the issuance of equity securities, our stockholders may suffer dilution and our ability to use our net operating losses to offset future income may be limited. If we raise additional funding through debt financing, we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, require us to use our cash to make payments under such indebtedness, force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios or restrict our ability to pay dividends or make acquisitions. If we are unable to secure additional funding, our development programs and our commercialization efforts would be delayed, reduced or eliminated, our relationships with our suppliers and manufacturers may be harmed, and we may not be able to continue our operations.\nFailure to integrate our recently-acquired business into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business.\nOur integration of the operations of the Aquadex Business requires significant efforts and we may need to allocate more resources to integration and product development activities than originally anticipated. These efforts will result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of management\u2019s time. Our failure to manage and coordinate the growth of the company could also have an adverse impact on our business. Investments in medical technology are inherently risky, and we cannot guarantee that the Aquadex Business will be profitable or successful or will not have a material unfavorable impact on us. Acquisitions can cause decrease in customer loyalty and product orders in connection with the change of ownership and management. Customers may be unwilling to continue doing business with us after our acquisition of the Aquadex Business from Baxter and some customers may not consent to the assignment of their contracts with Baxter or agree to enter into a new contract with us. Inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies may adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. We also could experience negative effects on our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition from acquisition-related charges, amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges. These effects, individually or in the aggregate, could harm our business.\nOur near-term prospects are highly dependent on the development of a single product, the Aquadex FlexFlow.\nWe face significant challenges in expanding market acceptance of the Aquadex FlexFlow, which could adversely affect our potential sales and revenues.\nOur near-term prospects are highly dependent on the development of a single product, the Aquadex FlexFlow, and we have no other commercial products or products in active development at this time. The established market or customer base for our Aquadex FlexFlow is limited and our success depends on our ability to increase adoption of the Aquadex FlexFlow. Acceptance of our product in the marketplace by health care providers is uncertain, and our failure to achieve sufficient market acceptance will significantly limit our ability to generate revenue and be profitable. Market acceptance will require substantial marketing efforts and the expenditure of significant funds by us to inform health care providers of the benefits of using the Aquadex FlexFlow and to provide further training on its use. We may not be able to build key relationships with health care providers to drive further sales in the United States or sell the Aquadex FlexFlow outside the United States. Product orders may be cancelled, patients or customers currently using our products may cease to do so and patients or customers expected to begin using our products may not. Our ability to achieve acceptance of our Aquadex FlexFlow depends on our ability to demonstrate the safety, efficacy, ease-of-use and cost-effectiveness of the system. We may not be able to expand the adoption and market acceptance of the Aquadex FlexFlow to both the inpatient and outpatient markets and our potential sales and revenues could be harmed.\nWe will need to raise additional capital in the future. If additional capital is not available, we will have to delay, reduce or cease operations.\nWe expect to seek additional financing during 2017. Changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate and could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital. Additional financing may not be available when we need it or may not be available on terms that are favorable to us. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis or at all, we would likely be required to significantly reduce our operations.\nWe have no commercial manufacturing experience and could experience difficulty in producing the Aquadex FlexFlow and related components or may need to depend on third parties for manufacturing.\nWe have no experience in commercial manufacturing and no experience in commercially manufacturing the Aquadex FlexFlow and related components. As a result, we may not be able to develop and implement efficient, low-cost manufacturing capabilities and processes that will enable us to manufacture the Aquadex FlexFlow or related components in significant volumes, while meeting the legal, regulatory, quality, price, durability, engineering, design and production standards required to market our products successfully. In addition, we depend upon third parties to manufacture and supply components for the Aquadex FlexFlow. We are party to a commercial manufacturing and supply agreement with Baxter which requires Baxter to manufacture Aquadex Blood Sets and Aquadex Catheters for a period of 18 months following our acquisition of the Aquadex Business. There is no such agreement relating to the manufacturing of Consoles. We plan to transfer Console manufacturing to us or a qualified contract manufacturer by mid-year 2017 and Aquadex Blood Set and Catheter manufacturing activities from Baxter to us or a qualified contract manufacturer by the end of 2017, but we may experience difficulties in doing so. Furthermore, we may not be able to contract for such manufacturing on terms favorable to us or at all. If we experience difficulties in transitioning manufacturing operations, we may experience delays in providing products and services to our customers, and our business could be harmed.\nWe depend upon third-party suppliers, including single source suppliers to us and our customers, making us vulnerable to supply problems and price fluctuations.\nWe will rely on third-party suppliers, including single source suppliers, to provide us with certain components of the Aquadex FlexFlow and to provide key components or supplies for use with our products. We depend on our suppliers to provide us and our customers with materials in a timely manner that meet our and their quality, quantity and cost requirements. The forecasts of demand we use to determine order quantities and lead times for components purchased from outside suppliers may be incorrect. Our failure to obtain required components or subassemblies when needed and at a reasonable cost would adversely affect our business. These suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, any of which could delay or impede their ability to meet our demand. Any difficulties in locating and hiring third-party manufacturers, or in the ability of third-party manufacturers to supply quantities of our products at the times and in the quantities we need, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we cannot develop adequate distribution, customer service and technical support networks, then we may not be able to market and distribute the Aquadex system effectively and our sales and revenues will suffer.\nOur strategy requires us to provide a significant amount of customer service and maintenance and other technical service to our customers. To provide these services, we have begun, and will need to continue, to develop a network of distribution and a staff of employees and independent contractors in each of the areas in which we intend to operate. We cannot assure that we will be able to organize and manage this network on a cost-effective basis. If we cannot effectively organize and manage this network, then it may be\ndifficult for us to distribute our products and to provide competitive service and support to our customers, in which case customers may be unable, or decide not, to order our products and our sales and revenues will suffer.\nWe compete against many companies, some of which have longer operating histories, more established products and greater resources than we do, which may prevent us from achieving further market penetration or improving operating results.\nCompetition from medical device companies and medical device divisions of health care companies, as well as pharmaceutical companies is intense and is expected to increase. Our Aquadex FlexFlow mainly competes against pharmacological therapies, diuretics, as well as a range of other specialized medical device companies with devices at varying stages of development. Some of these competitors have significantly greater financial and human resources than we do and have established reputations, as well as worldwide distribution channels and sales and marketing capabilities that are significantly larger and more established than ours. Additional competitors may enter the market, and we are likely to compete with new companies in the future. We also face competition from other medical therapies which may focus on our target market as well as competition from manufacturers of pharmaceutical and other devices that have not yet been developed. Competition from these companies could harm our business. In addition, because our system has been implanted in a limited number of patients to date, all of the material risks and potential competitive disadvantages of our system are not necessarily known at this time.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to distinguish our Company and our system from our competitors and their products. Factors affecting our competitive position include:\n\u00b7 financial resources;\n\u00b7 product performance and design;\n\u00b7 product safety;\n\u00b7 acceptance of our system in the marketplace;\n\u00b7 sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u00b7 manufacturing and assembly costs;\n\u00b7 pricing of our system and of our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u00b7 the availability of reimbursement from government and private health insurers;\n\u00b7 success and timing of new product development and introductions;\n\u00b7 regulatory approvals in the United States; and\n\u00b7 intellectual property protection.\nThe competition for qualified personnel is particularly intense in our industry. If we are unable to retain or hire key personnel, we may not be able to sustain or grow our business.\nOur ability to operate successfully and manage our potential future growth depends significantly upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified research, technical, clinical, regulatory, sales, marketing, managerial and financial personnel. We face intense competition for such personnel, and we may not be able to attract, retain and motivate these individuals. We compete for talent with numerous companies, as well as universities and nonprofit research organizations. Our future success also depends on the personal efforts and abilities of the principal members of our senior management and scientific staff to provide strategic direction, manage our operations and maintain a cohesive and stable environment. We do not maintain life insurance on the lives of any of the members of our senior management. The loss of key personnel for any reason or our inability to hire, retain and motivate additional qualified personnel in the future could prevent us from sustaining or growing our business.\nSignificant additional governmental regulation could subject us to unanticipated delays which would adversely affect our sales and revenues.\nOur business strategy depends in part on our ability to expand the use of the Aquadex FlexFlow in the market as quickly as possible. Health care laws in the United States and other countries are subject to ongoing changes, including changes to the amount of reimbursement for hospital services. Additional laws and regulations, or changes to existing laws and regulations that are applicable to our business may be enacted or promulgated, and the interpretation, application or enforcement of the existing laws and regulations may change. Legislative proposals can substantially change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers and may negatively impact payment rates for our system. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, applications or enforcements or the specific effects any of these might have on our business. However, in the United States and international markets, we expect that both government and third-party payers will continue to attempt to contain or reduce the costs of health care by challenging the prices charged, or deny coverage, for health care products and services. Any future laws, regulations, interpretations, applications or enforcements could delay or prevent regulatory approval or clearance of our Aquadex FlexFlow and our ability to market our Aquadex FlexFlow. Moreover, changes that result in our failure to comply with the requirements of\napplicable laws and regulations could result in the types of enforcement actions by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d) and/or other agencies as described above, all of which could impair our ability to have manufactured and to sell the affected products.\nIn the United States, the Aquadex FlexFlow is purchased primarily by customers, such as hospitals or other health care providers. Customers bill various third-party payers for covered Aquadex FlexFlow services provided to patients. These payers, which include federal health care programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), state health care programs, private health insurance companies and managed care organizations, would then reimburse our customers based on established payment formulas that take into account part or all of the cost associated with these devices and the related procedures performed.\nWhile the agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has not issued a favorable national coverage determination under its Investigational Device Exception Studies Program for ultrafiltration using the Aquadex FlexFlow, a number of private insurers have approved reimbursement for Aquadex FlexFlow for specific indications and points of service. In addition, patients and providers may see insurance coverage on a case-by-case basis. We are exploring the ability to increase the range of coverage for uses of Aquadex FlexFlow, such as use in the outpatient setting and use for decompensated heart failure and other indicated uses under its approved labeling, although we may not be successful in doing so.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \u201cHealth Reform Laws\u201d), provides those states that expand their Medicaid coverage to otherwise eligible state residents with incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level with an increased federal medical assistance percentage, effective January 1, 2014, when certain conditions are met. On June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate of the Health Reform Laws but partially invalidated the expansion of Medicaid. The ruling on Medicaid expansion allows states to elect not to participate in the expansion-and to forego funding for the Medicaid expansion-without losing their existing Medicaid funding. States will be expected to pay for part of costs of Medicaid expansion beginning in 2017. In light of the current political environmental and the possibility that proposed legislation may significantly impact Medicaid funding to states, it is unclear how states will pay their share of these additional Medicaid costs and providers would be able to continue to receive reimbursement for services to all patients receiving treatment using the Aquadex FlexFlow who are currently enrolled in Medicaid.\nWe enrolled patients in studies for the C-Pulse System through February 2016 and continue to have reporting obligations related to two open studies for the C-Pulse.\nConducting clinical studies is a complex and uncertain process. Clinical trials are subject to extensive recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Any clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an institutional review board for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including, but not limited to, those relating to current good clinical practices. Each trial must obtain the written informed consent of patients in form and substance that complies with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations. The testing company, the FDA or the IRB may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. Similarly, in Europe, the clinical study must be approved by a local ethics committee and, in some cases, including studies with high-risk devices, by the ministry of health in the applicable country. Patients may experience serious adverse events or side effects during the study, which, whether or not related to our system, could cause the FDA or other regulatory authorities to investigate and potentially assess regulatory penalties. Any regulatory penalties assessed for failure to comply with the foregoing requirements could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects and cause us to seek additional funding.\nProduct defects, including lawsuits for product liability, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects, unanticipated use of a product or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of the product can lead to injury or other adverse events. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to a product (either voluntary or required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries), and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of a product from the market. Any recall of our Aquadex FlexFlow or any related components could result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products. Additionally, the C-Pulse system treats Class III and ambulatory Class IV heart failure for patients who typically have serious medical issues. As a result, our exposure to product liability claims may be heightened because the people who use this system have a high risk of suffering adverse outcomes, regardless of the safety or efficacy of our system. In addition, because this system was implanted in a limited number of patients, we cannot assure you that we are currently aware of all material risks related to use of our system or that could lead to product liability claims against us. Personal injuries relating to the use of our products could also result in product liability claims being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals.\nWe may be held liable if any product we develop or commercialize causes injury or is found otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing, sale or consumer use. The safety studies we must perform and the regulatory approvals required to commercialize our products will not protect us from any such liability. We carry product liability insurance with a $5 million aggregate limit. However, if there are product liability claims against us, our insurance may be insufficient to cover the expense of defending against such claims, or may be insufficient to pay or settle such claims. Furthermore, we may be unable to obtain adequate product liability insurance coverage for commercial sales of any approved product. If such insurance is insufficient to protect us, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be harmed. If any product liability claim is made against us, our reputation and future sales will be damaged, even if we have adequate insurance coverage. Even if a product liability claim against us is without merit or if we are not found liable for any damages, a product liability claim could result in decreased interest in our registry studies, decreased demand for our system, if approved for commercialization, injury to our reputation, diversion of management\u2019s attention from operating our business, withdrawal of study participants, significant costs of related litigation, loss of revenue or the inability to commercialize our products.\nWe may face significant risks associated with international operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect to manufacture and to market our products globally. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including the following: fluctuations in exchange rates of the United States dollar could adversely affect our results of operations, we may face difficulties in enforcing and collecting accounts receivable under some countries\u2019 legal systems, local regulations may restrict our ability to sell our products, have our products manufactured or conduct other operations, political instability could disrupt our operations, some governments and customers may have longer payment cycles, with resulting adverse effects on our cash flow, and some countries could impose additional taxes or restrict the import of our products. Any one or more of these factors could increase our costs, reduce our revenues, or disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are not able to maintain sufficient quality controls, then the approval or clearance of our products by the European Union, the FDA or other relevant authorities could be withdrawn, delayed or denied and our sales and revenues will suffer.\nApproval or clearance of our products could be withdrawn, delayed or denied by the European Union, the FDA and the relevant authorities of other countries if our manufacturing facilities do not comply with their respective manufacturing requirements. The European Union imposes requirements on quality control systems of manufacturers, which are inspected and certified on a periodic basis and may be subject to additional unannounced inspections. Failure by our manufacturers to comply with these requirements could prevent us from marketing our products in the European Community. The FDA also imposes requirements through quality system requirements, or QSR, regulations, which include requirements for good manufacturing practices, or GMP. Failure by our manufacturers to comply with these requirements could prevent us from obtaining FDA approval of our products and from marketing such products in the United States. Although the manufacturing facilities and processes that we use to manufacture our products have been inspected and certified by a worldwide testing and certification agency (also referred to as a notified body) that performs conformity assessments to European Union requirements for medical devices, they have not been inspected by the FDA. A \u201cnotified body\u201d is a group accredited and monitored by governmental agencies that inspects manufacturing facilities and quality control systems at regular intervals and is authorized to carry out unannounced inspections. We cannot be sure that any of the facilities or processes we use will comply or continue to comply with their respective requirements on a timely basis or at all, which could delay or prevent our obtaining the approvals we need to market our products in the European Community and the United States.\nTo market our products in the European Community, the United States and other countries, where approved, manufacturers of such products must continue to comply or ensure compliance with the relevant manufacturing requirements. Although we cannot control the manufacturers of our products, if we choose to subcontract manufacturing to a contract manufacturer, we may need to expend time, resources and effort in product manufacturing and quality control to assist with their continued compliance with these requirements. If violations of applicable requirements are noted during periodic inspections of the manufacturing facilities of our manufacturers or we fail to address issues raised by the FDA in these inspections, then we may not be able to continue to market the products manufactured in such facilities and our revenues may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we violate any provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDC Act\u201d) or any other statutes or regulations, then we could be subject to enforcement actions by the FDA or other governmental agencies.\nWe face a significant compliance burden under the FDC Act and other applicable statutes and regulations which govern the testing, labeling, storage, record keeping, distribution, sale, marketing, advertising and promotion of our medically approved products.\nIf we violate the FDC Act or other regulatory requirements at any time during or after the product development and/or approval process, we could be subject to enforcement actions by the FDA or other agencies, including: fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of the production of our products, withdrawal of any existing approvals or pre-market clearances of our products, refusal to approve or clear new applications or notices relating to our products, recommendations that we not be allowed to enter into government contracts and criminal prosecution. Any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot assure you that our products will be safe or that there will not be serious injuries or product malfunctions. Further, we are required under applicable law to report any circumstances relating to our medically approved products that could result in deaths or serious injuries. These circumstances could trigger recalls, class action lawsuits and other events that could cause us to incur expenses and may also limit our ability to generate revenues from such products.\nWe cannot assure you that our products will prove to be safe or that there will not be serious injuries or product malfunctions, which could trigger recalls, class action lawsuits and other events that could cause us to incur significant expenses, limit our ability to market our products and generate revenues from such products or cause us reputational harm.\nUnder the FDC Act, we are required to submit medical device reports, or MDRs, to the FDA to report device-related deaths, serious injuries and malfunctions of medically approved products that could result in death or serious injury if they were to recur. Depending on their significance, MDRs could trigger events that could cause us to incur expenses and may also limit our ability to generate revenues from such products, such as the following: information contained in the MDRs could trigger FDA regulatory actions such as inspections, recalls and patient/physician notifications, because the reports are publicly available, MDRs could become the basis for private lawsuits, including class actions, and if we fail to submit a required MDR to the FDA, the FDA could take enforcement action against us.\nIf any of these events occur, then we could incur significant expenses and it could become more difficult for us to market and sell our products and to generate revenues from sales. Other countries may impose analogous reporting requirements that could cause us to incur expenses and may also limit our ability to generate revenues from sales of our products.\nWe face significant uncertainty in the industry due to government healthcare reform.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, (the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d) as well as other healthcare reform, including possible repeal of the Affordable Care Act, may have a significant impact on our business. The impact of the Affordable Care Act on the health care industry is extensive and includes, among other things, the federal government assuming a larger role in the health care system, expanding healthcare coverage of United States citizens and mandating basic healthcare benefits. The Affordable Care Act contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of Medicare and Medicaid, including imposing a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers that began in 2013. Although a moratorium was placed on the medical device excise tax in 2016 and 2017, if it is reinstated, it may adversely affect our sales and the cost of goods sold.\nThe Affordable Care Act includes a Hospital Readmission Reduction program and is designed to reduce payments to hospitals with excess heart failure readmissions, among other conditions. The penalty to hospitals can be significant, as much as 3% of total Medicare reimbursement. We believe the Aquadex FlexFlow may offer hospitals an economic benefit for using the device on a regular basis for in-patient or out-patient usage; however, if the Hospital Readmission Reduction program is repealed, hospitals may not be as inclined to take measures to reduce readmissions.\nIn addition, any healthcare reforms enacted in the future may, like the Affordable Care Act, be phased in over a number of years but, if enacted, could reduce our revenue, increase our costs, or require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business. In addition, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by changes under the Affordable Care Act and changes under any federal or state legislation adopted in the future.\nMoreover, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act (the Sunshine Act), which was enacted by Congress as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on March 23, 2010, requires medical device companies to track and publicly report, with limited exceptions, all payments and transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals in the U.S. Implementing regulations for these tracking and reporting obligations were finalized in 2013, and companies are now required to track payments made since August 1, 2013. If we fail to comply with the data collection and reporting obligations imposed by the Sunshine Act, we may be subject to substantial civil monetary penalties.\nWe are subject, directly or indirectly, to United States federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and false claims laws and regulations. Prosecutions under such laws have increased in recent years and we may become subject to such litigation. If we are unable to, or have not fully complied with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nOur operations are directly, or indirectly through customers, subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark Law and federal False Claims Act. These laws may impact, among other things, our sales, marketing and education programs.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Several courts have interpreted the statute\u2019s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and, despite a series of narrow safe harbors, prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Penalties for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nThe physician self-referral laws, commonly referred to as the Stark law is a strict liability statute that generally prohibits physicians from referring Medicare patients to providers of \u201cdesignated health services,\u201d with whom the physician or the physician\u2019s immediate family member has an ownership interest or compensation arrangement, unless an applicable exception applies. Moreover, many states have adopted or are considering adopting similar laws, some of which extend beyond the scope of the Stark law to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the prohibited referral of patients for designated healthcare services and physician self-referrals, regardless of the source of the payment for the patient\u2019s care. If it is determined that any of the relationships we may have with physicians violate the Stark law or similar statutes, we could become subject to civil and criminal penalties. The imposition of any such penalties could harm our business.\nThe federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing, or causing to be filed, a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The frequency of filing qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of medical device, pharmaceutical and healthcare companies to have to defend a False Claim Act action. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.\nWe are unable to predict whether we could be subject to actions under any of these laws, or the impact of such actions. If we are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or other applicable state and federal fraud and abuse laws, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government healthcare reimbursement programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nIf we acquire other businesses, products or technologies, we will be subject to risks that could hurt our business.\nWe may pursue acquisitions to obtain complementary businesses, products or technologies. Any such acquisition may not produce the revenues, earnings or business synergies that we anticipate and an acquired business, product or technology might not perform as we expect. Our management could spend a significant amount of time, effort and money in identifying, pursuing and completing the acquisition. If we complete an acquisition, we may encounter significant difficulties and incur substantial expenses in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses, products or technologies into our operations. In particular, we may lose the services of key employees and we may make changes in management that impair the acquired business\u2019s relationships with employees, vendors and customers. Additionally, we may acquire development-stage companies that are not yet profitable and which require continued investment, which could decrease our future earnings or increase our futures losses.\nAny of these outcomes could prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of an acquisition. To pay for an acquisition, we might use stock or cash. Alternatively, we might borrow money from a bank or other lender. If we use stock, our stockholders would experience dilution of their ownership interests. If we use cash or debt financing, our financial liquidity would be reduced. As a result of our annual impairment testing, we may be required to capitalize a significant amount of intangibles, including goodwill, which may lead to significant amortization or write-off charges. These amortization charges and write-offs could decrease our future earnings or increase our future losses.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights effectively, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection in the United States and other countries of the intellectual property relating to or incorporated into our Aquadex FlexFlow and related components. As of December 31, 2016, we owned over 35 issued patents and 13 pending patent applications in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions related to our C-Pulse System and had 2 pending applications for neuromodulation. We estimate that most of our currently issued U.S. patents will expire between approximately 2021 and 2027. Given the strategic refocus away from C-Pulse and towards Aquadex FlexFlow, we have chosen to limit the maintenance of issued C-Pulse related patents to those innovations that are of the highest value. Further, we have elected to emphasize a few of the most critical jurisdictions rather than maintain the earlier approach that involved multiple countries.\nOn August 5, 2016, upon closing of our acquisition of the Aquadex Business, we entered into a patent license agreement with Baxter, pursuant to which we obtained, for no additional consideration, a world-wide license to 49 exclusively licensed and 9 non-exclusively licensed patents used in connection with the Aquadex FlexFlow to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import, the Aquadex FlexFlow in the \u201cfield of use.\u201d The \u201cfield of use\u201d is defined as system and apparatus only capable of performing isolated ultrafiltration for treatment of congestive heart failure, and methods to the extent used therein (excluding system, apparatus, or methods performing any kind of renal therapy or dialysis and/or any system capable of providing substitution fluid). The license is exclusive, with respect to some patents, and non-exclusive, with respect to other patents. Under the patent license agreement, Baxter has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to continue maintenance of seven \u201crequired maintenance patents,\u201d and we have agreed to reimburse Baxter for all fees, costs, and expenses (internal or external) incurred by Baxter in connection with such continued maintenance. The rights granted to us under the patent license agreement will automatically revert to Baxter in the event we cease operation of the Aquadex Business or we file for, or have filed against us, or otherwise undertake any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, or other similar proceeding. In addition, for two years following the closing, the patent license agreement is not assignable by us (including in connection with a change of control) without Baxter\u2019s prior written consent. We estimate that the patents licensed from Baxter will expire between approximately 2020 and 2025.\nOur pending and future patent applications may not issue as patents or, if issued, may not issue in a form that will provide us any competitive advantage. Even if issued, existing or future patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or limit the length of terms of patent protection we may have for our system. Changes in patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries could also diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. In addition, the legal systems of certain countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. In order to preserve and enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights, we may need to make claims or file lawsuits against third parties. This can entail significant costs to us and divert our management\u2019s attention from our business.\nIntellectual property litigation could be costly and disruptive to us.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties may assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies used in our business. Any claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel or require us to pay substantial damages. If we are unsuccessful in defending ourselves against these types of claims, we may be required to do one or more of the following:\n\u00b7 halt use of our Aquadex Business;\n\u00b7 attempt to obtain a license to sell or use the relevant technology or substitute technology, which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all; or\n\u00b7 redesign our system.\nIn the event a claim against us were successful and we could not obtain a license to the relevant technology on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology or redesign our system to avoid infringement, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be significantly harmed.\nIf we were unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and system could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented proprietary technology, trade secrets, processes and know-how. We generally seek to protect this information by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and third parties. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nOur products could infringe patent rights of others, which may require costly litigation and, if we are not successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages or limit our ability to commercialize our products.\nOur commercial success depends on our ability to increase adoption of the Aquadex Business without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. As our industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that there may be patents issued to third parties that relate to our system and technologies of which we are not aware or that we must challenge to continue our operations as currently contemplated. Our system may infringe or may be alleged to infringe these patents.\nIn addition, some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our issued patents or our pending applications or that we were the first to invent the technology. Another party may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering our system or technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our patent applications or patents, which could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in an interference or deviation proceeding declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful if the other party had independently arrived at the same or similar invention prior to our own invention, resulting in a loss of our U.S. patent position with respect to such inventions.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in our industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other medical device companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees, or we, have used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected health information, personally identifiable information, intellectual property and proprietary business information owned or controlled by ourselves or others. At times we may have access to limited amounts of protected health information as part of other healthcare providers\u2019 provision of treatment to patients with our medical devices. We manage and maintain our applications and data utilizing on-site systems. These applications and data encompass a wide variety of business-critical information including research and development information, commercial information, and business and financial information. We face four primary risks relative to protecting this critical information, including: loss of access risk; inappropriate disclosure risk; inappropriate modification risk; and the risk of our being unable to adequately monitor our controls over the first three risks.\nThe secure processing, storage, maintenance, and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or viruses or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. Any such breach or interruption could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy of personal information and regulatory penalties. To the extent that we may engage in activities regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Clinical and Economic Health Act (HITECH) we may have additional regulatory and reporting obligations. Although we believe we have implemented adequate security measures, there is no guarantee we can continue to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access, loss or dissemination that could also disrupt our operations,\nincluding our ability to conduct our analyses conduct research and development activities, collect, process, and prepare company financial information, provide information about our products and other patient and physician education and outreach efforts through our website, manage the administrative aspects of our business, and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, the interpretation and application of consumer, health-related, and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory, and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. If so, this could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, these privacy regulations may differ from country to country, and may vary based on whether testing is performed in the United States or in the local country. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nNasdaq may delist our common stock from its exchange which could limit your ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOn September 21, 2016, we received notice from the Staff of Nasdaq indicating that the Staff had determined to delist our securities from The Nasdaq Capital Market due to our then continued non-compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. We timely requested a hearing before the Panel, which occurred on November 10, 2016. On November 11, 2016, we received notice from the Staff that we no longer satisfied Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b) insofar as we did not expect to report stockholders\u2019 equity of at least $2.5 million upon the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and that the deficiency could serve as an additional basis for the delisting of the Company\u2019s common stock from The Nasdaq Capital Market. On November 21, 2016, Nasdaq informed us that the Panel had granted us continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market while we implement our plan to regain compliance with the minimum bid price and minimum stockholders\u2019 equity requirements. The Panel granted us until January 30, 2017 to evidence a closing bid price of $1.00 or more for a minimum of ten prior consecutive trading days and until March 20, 2017 to evidence compliance with the $2.5 million stockholder\u2019s equity requirement. On December 9, 2016, we provided notice of our intention to call a special meeting of our stockholders on January 9, 2017 to, among other things, obtain stockholder approval for a reverse stock split. At a special meeting of our stockholders on January 9, 2017, our stockholders approved, among other things, a reverse stock split, and following such special meeting, our Board of Directors approved a 1-for-30 reverse split of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding shares of common stock. The reverse stock split became effective as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on January 12, 2017, and the Company\u2019s common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on The Nasdaq Capital Market on January 13, 2017. We received confirmation from Nasdaq on February 9, 2017 that we have regained compliance with the minimum bid price rule.\nDespite our efforts, we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity or other listing requirements. If it appears to the Nasdaq staff that we will not meet the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity or any other listing standard, our common stock may be subject to delisting. If our common stock is delisted, our common stock would likely trade only in the over-the-counter market. If our common stock were to trade on the over-the-counter market, selling our common stock could be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold and transactions could be delayed, and we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u00b7 a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u00b7 reduced liquidity with respect to our securities;\n\u00b7 a determination that our shares are a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which will require brokers trading in our securities to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u00b7 a reduced amount of news and analyst coverage for our Company; and\n\u00b7 a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThese factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our common stock and would substantially impair our ability to raise additional funds and could result in a loss of institutional investor interest and fewer development opportunities for us.\nIn addition to the foregoing, if our common stock is delisted from NASDAQ and it trades on the over-the-counter market, the application of the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and increase the transaction costs to sell those shares. The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d as an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. The closing price of our common stock on March 1, 2017 was $4.33.\nIf our common stock is delisted from NASDAQ and it trades on the over-the-counter market at a price of less than $5.00 per share, our common stock would be considered a penny stock. The SEC\u2019s penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and the salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. In addition, the penny stock rules generally require that before a transaction in a penny stock occurs, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s agreement to the transaction. If applicable in the future, these rules may restrict the ability of brokers-dealers to sell our common stock and may affect the ability of investors to sell their shares, until our common stock no longer is considered a penny stock.\nThe reverse split of our common stock could decrease our total market capitalization and increase the volatility of our stock price.\nWe effected 1-for-30 reverse split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on January 12, 2017, and our common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on The Nasdaq Capital Market on January 13, 2017. There can be no assurance that the total market capitalization of our common stock after the reverse stock split will be equal to or greater than the total market capitalization before the reverse stock split or that the per share market price of our common stock following the reverse stock split will increase in proportion to the reduction in the number of shares of common stock outstanding before the reverse stock split. Furthermore, a decline in the market price of our common stock after the reverse stock split may result in a greater percentage decline than would occur in the absence of a reverse stock split, and the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected following such a reverse stock split.\nThe number of shares of common stock underlying our outstanding preferred stock and outstanding warrants is significant in relation to our currently outstanding common stock and could cause downward pressure on the market price for our common stock and conversion of such outstanding convertible securities will cause dilution to holders of our common stock.\nThe number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our outstanding preferred stock and exercise of outstanding warrants is significant in relation to the number of shares of our common stock currently outstanding. If any security holder, including the Selling Stockholders, determines to sell a substantial number of shares into the market at any given time, there may not be sufficient demand in the market to purchase the shares without a decline in the market price for our common stock. Moreover, continuous sales into the market of a number of shares in excess of the typical trading volume for our common stock, or even the availability of such a large number of shares, could depress the trading market for our common stock over an extended period of time. Through March 1, 2017, shares of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock have been converted into 501,000 shares of our common stock. As of March 1, 2017, 344.9 shares of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock remain outstanding and are currently convertible into 67,627 shares of our common stock, and 900 shares of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock remain outstanding and are convertible into 200,759 shares of our common stock. If the effective price per share in a future offering is lower than the then price of conversion of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock or the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, then the price of conversion of such preferred stock shall be reduced to equal to such lower price and such preferred stock shall be issuable for additional shares of common stock in connection with such conversion price reduction. Furthermore, each holder of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock has the right to exchange all or some of the Series C Preferred Stock for securities issued in a future offering on a $1.00 for $1.00 basis based on the outstanding stated value of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, along with any accrued but unpaid liquidated damages and other amounts owing thereon, and the effective price in the offering. With respect to our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, on or after May 3, 2017, the conversion price on our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock shall become an adjustable rate equal to 80% of the average of the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock for the ten trading days immediately prior to the conversion date, but shall not be reduced below $1.26. To the extent the outstanding shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock or Series D Convertible Preferred Stock become exercisable for additional shares of common stock, holders of our common stock will experience further dilution.\nAs of March 1, 2017, we have warrants to purchase 926,884 shares of common stock outstanding. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated February 15, 2017 with the holders of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cHolders\u201d), who also hold certain outstanding warrants (the \u201cWarrants\u201d), we agreed in consideration for the Holders exercising Warrants during the period beginning on February 15, 2017 to and including March 31, 2017 (the \u201cExercise Period\u201d), that we would issue, promptly upon receipt of the cash exercise price, a common stock purchase warrant to the Holders (the \u201cNew Warrants\u201d) pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, to purchase up to a number of shares of our common stock equal to 100% of the number of shares issued pursuant to such Holder\u2019s exercise of Warrants under the letter agreement, which New Warrants shall have a term of five years from the date of issuance and an exercise price equal to consolidated closing bid price of our common stock as quoted on The Nasdaq Capital Market on the date each New Warrant is issued. The letter agreement also (i) amends the definition of \u201cBeneficial Ownership Limitation\u201d in the Warrants to mean, solely for purposes of any exercises of such Warrants that occurs during the Exercise Period, \u201c9.99%\u201d and (ii) amends the initial exercise date of the Warrants issued on November 3, 2016 and January 11,\n2017 so that such Warrants are exercisable on or after the receipt of stockholder approval of such Warrants. Since such stockholder approval was received on January 9, 2017, such Warrants became immediately exercisable on the date of the letter agreement. On February 15, 2017, following the execution of the letter agreement, the Holders exercised Warrants to purchase shares of our common stock so that, after such exercise, such holders owned, in the aggregate, 9.9% of our common stock. We received gross proceeds of $563,863 in connection with such exercise and issued the Holders New Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 104,419 shares of our common stock with a per share exercise price of $4.99. To the extent additional Warrants are exercised during the Exercise Period and we issue additional New Warrants, holders of our common stock will be further diluted and sales of any shares of common stock underlying such Warrants or the New Warrants could cause downward pressure on the market price for our common stock.\nThe rights of holders of our capital stock will be subject to, and could be adversely affected by, the rights of holders of our outstanding preferred stock any stock that may be issued in the future.\nOur board of directors has authority, without further stockholder approval, to issue additional shares of preferred stock with such rights, preferences and privileges as our board may determine. These rights, preferences and privileges may include dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights and liquidation rights that may be greater than the rights of our common stock.\nOur board of directors has approved, pursuant to this authority, the issuance of preferred stock, and we have 344.9 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and 900 shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding as of March 1, 2017. The rights, preferences and privileges of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock are described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 31, 2016. As described therein, upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, holders of our Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock have the right to receive, out of the assets, whether capital or surplus, of the Company, (i) for the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, an amount equal to the par value, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, and (ii) for the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, an amount equal to the stated value, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon and any other fees or liquidated damages then due and owing thereon, in each case, for each such share of preferred stock held by such holder before any distribution or payment shall be made to the holders of our common stock, and, following such payment, such holders are entitled to receive the same amount that a holder of common stock would receive if such preferred stock was fully converted, pari passu with all the holders of common stock. Our board of directors may issue additional series of preferred stock in the future pursuant to this authority. As a result, the rights of holders of our capital stock will be subject to, and could be adversely affected by, the rights of holders of any stock that may be issued in the future.\nWe have a large number of authorized but unissued shares of stock, which could negatively impact a potential investor if they purchased our common stock.\nWe effected 1-for-30 reverse split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on January 12, 2017, and our common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on The Nasdaq Capital Market on January 13, 2017.\nBecause the number of authorized shares of our common stock was not reduced proportionately, the reverse stock split increased our board of directors\u2019 ability to issue authorized and unissued shares without further stockholder action. As of March 1, 2017, our certificate of incorporation provides for 100,000,000 shares of authorized common stock and 40,000,000 shares of authorized preferred stock. As of March 1, 2017, we had 1,741,745 shares of common stock outstanding and 90,651 shares of common stock reserved pursuant to outstanding convertible preferred stock, warrants, options or restricted stock units or under the Company\u2019s equity incentive plans.\nWith respect to authorized but unissued and unreserved shares, we could also use such shares to oppose a hostile takeover attempt or delay or prevent changes in control or changes in or removal of management. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock may have a dilutive effect on earnings per share and relative voting power and may cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. We could use the shares that are available for future issuance in dilutive equity financing transactions, or to oppose a hostile takeover attempt or delay or prevent changes in control or changes in or removal of management, including transactions that are favored by a majority of the stockholders or in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices or benefit in some other manner.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell the common stock you want or at prices you find attractive.\nThe price of our common stock constantly changes. The price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including the following:\n\u00b7 future announcements concerning us, including our clinical and product development strategy, or our competitors;\n\u00b7 regulatory developments, disclosure regarding completed, ongoing or future clinical studies and enforcement actions bearing on advertising, marketing or sales;\n\u00b7 reports and recommendations of analysts and whether or not we meet the milestones and metrics set forth in such reports;\n\u00b7 introduction of new products;\n\u00b7 acquisition or loss of significant manufacturers, distributors or suppliers or an inability to obtain sufficient quantities of materials needed to manufacture our system;\n\u00b7 quarterly variations in operating results, which we have experienced in the past and expect to experience in the future;\n\u00b7 business acquisitions or divestitures;\n\u00b7 changes in governmental or third-party reimbursement practices;\n\u00b7 fluctuations of investor interest in the medical device sector; and\n\u00b7 fluctuations in the economy, world political events or general market conditions.\nIn addition, stock markets in general, and the market for shares of health care stocks in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years, fluctuations that frequently have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock could decline below its current price and the market price of our shares may fluctuate significantly in the future. These fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance. We expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate.\nOur ability to use U.S. net operating loss carryforwards or Australian tax losses might be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had U.S. net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of approximately $110.6 million for U.S. income tax purposes, which expire from 2024 through 2034. To the extent these NOL carryforwards are available, we intend to use them to reduce any corporate income tax liability associated with our operations that we might have in the future. Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of NOL carryforwards that might be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in stock ownership. As a result, prior or future changes in ownership, including due to this offering, could put limitations on the availability of our NOL carryforwards. In addition, our ability to utilize the current NOL carryforwards might be further limited by future issuances of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had tax losses in the Commonwealth of Australia of approximately AU$49.0 million. Continuing utilization of carryforward tax losses in Australia may also be affected by the issuance of our common stock. This is because one test for carrying forward tax losses in Australia from year to year requires continuity of ultimate ownership (subject to the relevant tests in Australian tax law) of more than 50% between the loss year and the income year in which the loss is claimed.\nTo the extent use of our NOL carryforwards or tax losses is limited, our income could be subject to corporate income tax earlier than it would if we were able to use NOL carryforwards and tax losses, which could result in lower profits.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, and we currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our products and business. Accordingly, our stockholders will not realize a return on their investments unless the trading price of our common stock appreciates.\nWe will continue to incur increased costs as a result of being a U.S. reporting company.\nIn connection with the effectiveness of our registration statement on Form 10, as of February 14, 2012, we became subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Although we were previously listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and had been required to file financial information and make certain other filings with the Australian Securities Exchange, our status as a U.S. reporting company under the Exchange Act has caused us, and will continue to cause us, to incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not previously incur, including costs related to compliance with the requirements of SOX and the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market. We expect these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly, and these activities may increase general and administrative expenses and divert management\u2019s time and attention away from revenue-generating activities. Furthermore, now that we are a revenue-generating company following the acquisition of the Aquadex Business in August 2016, our costs to comply with regulations applicable to U.S. reporting companies may further increase. We also expect these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers.\nInvestors could lose confidence in our financial reports, and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected, if our internal controls over financial reporting are found not to be effective by management or by an independent registered public accounting firm or if we make disclosure of existing or potential material weaknesses in those controls.\nIn connection with becoming a company required to file reports with the SEC, we are required to comply with the internal control evaluation and certification requirements of Section 404 of SOX. Our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of SOX until the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act or a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined by applicable SEC rules. We will no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d on or before December 31, 2017, although we will remain a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as long as our public float remains less than $75 million as of the last business day of our most recently-completed second fiscal quarter.\nWe continue to evaluate our existing internal controls over financial reporting against the standards adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. During the course of our ongoing evaluation of the internal controls, we may identify areas requiring improvement, and may have to design enhanced processes and controls to address issues identified through this review. Remediating any deficiencies, significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that we or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify may require us to incur significant costs and expend significant time and management resources. We cannot assure you that any of the measures we implement to remedy any such deficiencies will effectively mitigate or remedy such deficiencies. The existence of one or more material weaknesses could affect the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting. It may be more difficult for us to manage our internal control over financial reporting following our acquisition of the Aquadex Business now that we are a revenue generating company. Investors could lose confidence in our financial reports, and the value of our common stock may be harmed, if our internal controls over financial reporting are found not to be effective by management or by an independent registered public accounting firm or if we make disclosure of existing or potential material weaknesses in those controls.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), or (iv) any other action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions described above. This forum selection provision may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as certain provisions of the DGCL, may delay or deter a change in control transaction.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of deterring takeovers, such as those provisions authorizing our board of directors to issue, from time to time, any series of preferred stock and fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of such series of preferred stock; prohibiting stockholders from acting by written consent in lieu of a meeting; requiring advance notice of stockholder intention to put forth director nominees or bring up other business at a stockholders\u2019 meeting; prohibiting stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders; requiring a 66 2/3% majority stockholder approval in order for stockholders to amend certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or adopt new bylaws; providing that, subject to the rights of preferred shares, the directors will be divided into three classes and the number of directors is to be fixed exclusively by our board of directors; and providing that none of our directors may be removed without cause. Section 203 of the DGCL, from which we did not elect to opt out, provides that if a holder acquires 15% or more of our stock without prior approval of our board of directors, that holder will be subject to certain restrictions on its ability to acquire us within three years. These provisions may delay or deter a change in control of us, and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under federal securities laws and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the external auditor attestation requirements of Section 404\nof SOX, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. The JOBS Act also permits emerging growth companies to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to U.S. public companies. We will be an emerging growth company until December 31, 2017. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may decline or be more volatile.\nAs explained above, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An emerging growth company can delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period, and as a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates for new or revised accounting standards for U.S. public companies. We will be an emerging growth company until December 31, 2017 and after such date can no longer take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act.", "PERMNO": 13279, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "CHFS"}
