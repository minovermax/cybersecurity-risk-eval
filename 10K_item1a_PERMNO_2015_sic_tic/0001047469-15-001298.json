{"cik": "718877", "company": "Activision Blizzard, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe wish to caution the reader that the following important risk factors, and those risk factors described elsewhere in this report or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in forward-looking statements contained in this document and elsewhere. These risks are not presented in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Further, the risks described below are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows or liquidity.\nWe depend on a relatively small number of franchises for a significant portion of our revenues and profits.\nA significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from products based on a relatively small number of popular franchises and these products are responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits. For example, our three largest franchises in 2014-Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Skylanders-accounted for approximately 67% of our net revenues, and a significantly higher percentage of our operating income, for the year. We expect that a relatively limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our revenues and profits. Due to this dependence on a limited number of franchises, the failure to achieve anticipated results by one or more products based on these franchises could negatively impact our business.\nIf we do not consistently deliver high-quality titles, or if consumers prefer competing products, our sales could suffer.\nWhile many new products are regularly introduced in our industry, increasingly only a relatively small number of titles account for a significant portion of net revenues, and an even greater portion of net profit. It is difficult to produce high-quality products and to predict, prior to production and distribution, what products will be well-received, even if they are well-reviewed, high-quality titles. Competitors often develop titles that imitate or compete with our best-selling titles, and take sales away from them or reduce our ability to charge the same prices we have historically charged for those titles. Products published by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than anticipated, which could cause our product sales to fall below expectations. Consumers may lose interest in a genre of games we produce. If we do not continue to develop consistently high-quality and well-received products, or if our competitors develop more successful products or offer competitive products at lower prices, our revenues, margins and profitability could decline. The increased importance of downloadable content to our business amplifies these risks, as downloadable content for poorly-received titles typically generates lower-than-expected sales. In addition, our own best-selling products could compete with our other titles, reducing sales for those other titles. Further, a failure by us to develop a high-quality product, or our development of a product that is otherwise not well-received, could harm our reputation and increase the likelihood that our future products will not be well-received.\nWe have taken on significant debt, which could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn connection with the Purchase Transaction, we entered into a credit agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") for a $2.5 billion secured term loan facility (the \"Term Loan\") and a $250 million secured revolving credit facility (the \"Revolver\") and issued, at par, $1.5 billion of 5.625% unsecured senior notes due September 2021 (the \"2021 Notes\") and $750 million of 6.125% unsecured senior notes due September 2023 (the \"2023 Notes\" and, together with the 2021 Notes, the \"Notes\"). Historically, the Company has maintained extremely low levels of debt. The increased debt burden could have important consequences, including: increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund our operations, growth strategy, working capital, capital expenditures, future business opportunities and other general corporate purposes; exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates with respect to any borrowings that are at variable rates of interest; restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; limiting our ability to adjust to\nchanging market conditions; and placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors who are less highly leveraged.\nThe agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business.\nAgreements governing our indebtedness, including the indenture governing the Notes and the Credit Agreement, impose operating and financial restrictions on our activities. These restrictions require us to comply with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios. In addition, the indenture and credit agreement limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022 incur additional debt and guarantees;\n\u2022 pay distributions or dividends and repurchase stock;\n\u2022 make other restricted payments, including without limitation, certain restricted investments;\n\u2022 create liens;\n\u2022 enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries;\n\u2022 engage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022 enter into mergers, consolidations or sales of substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition, if, in the future, we borrow under the Revolver, we may be required, during certain periods where outstanding revolving loans exceed a certain threshold, to maintain a maximum senior secured net leverage ratio calculated pursuant to a financial maintenance covenant under the Credit Agreement.\nThese restrictions on our ability to operate our business could seriously harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities.\nFurther, various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. Such a default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations, including our obligations under the indenture governing the Notes or the Credit Agreement. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing. We cannot assure you that we will be granted waivers or amendments to these agreements if for any reason we are unable to comply with these agreements or that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe may not be able to borrow funds under our five-year revolving credit facility if we are not able to meet the conditions to borrowing under that facility.\nWe view our Revolver as a source of available liquidity. This facility contains various conditions, covenants and representations with which we must be in compliance in order to borrow funds. We have not borrowed under the Revolver to date, but if we wish to do so, there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with these conditions, covenants and representations at such time.\nOur financial performance is partly driven by the success of our Call of Duty franchise in the first-person action game category.\nActivision Blizzard is a leading global developer, publisher and distributor in terms of revenues in the first-person action game category, primarily due to the popularity of Activision's Call of Duty franchise. Revenues from the Call of Duty franchise comprise a significant portion of our consolidated revenues. To remain a leader in the first-person action game category, it is important that we continue to develop new games in the Call of Duty franchise that are favorably received by both our existing consumer base and new consumers. A number of software publishers have developed and commercialized, or are currently developing, first-person action games which pose a threat to the popularity of Call of Duty, and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge in the first-person action category. If consumer demand for Call of Duty games declines and we have not introduced new first-person action games or added other sources of revenue, or if consumer preferences trend away from first-person action games, it could negatively impact our business.\nOur financial performance is partly driven by the success of our World of Warcraft franchise in the subscription-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game category.\nBlizzard is the leading global developer, publisher and distributor in terms of subscriber base and revenues in the subscription-based MMORPG category, due to the popularity of Blizzard's World of Warcraft franchise. To maintain its leadership position, it is important that Blizzard continues to refresh World of Warcraft in a way that is favorably received by both our existing consumer base and new consumers. A number of software publishers have developed and commercialized, or are currently developing, online games for use by consumers over the Internet which pose a threat to the popularity of World of Warcraft, and we expect new competitors to continue to emerge in the MMORPG and other similar competing categories.\nA substantial portion of our revenues is generated by subscription fees paid by consumers who play World of Warcraft. In connection with the release of the large-scale expansion World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor in November 2014, the number of subscribes reached approximately 10 million at December 31, 2014 as compared to 7.8 million at December 31, 2013. However, we anticipate downward pressure on the number of subscribers in 2015, as we have seen historically in the year following the release of a large scale expansion. A significant decrease in the number of overall subscribers for World of Warcraft could substantially harm our operating results. If consumer demand for World of Warcraft games declines and we do not add other sources of revenue, or if new technologies, play patterns or genres are developed that replace MMORPGs, consumer preferences trend away from MMORPGs or new business models that offer MMORPG gameplay for free or at a substantial discount to current MMORPG subscription fees become widely accepted, it may negatively impact our business.\nSales of titles in our Skylanders franchise may be affected by the availability of toys, increasing our exposure to imbalances between projected and actual demand.\nTitles in our Skylanders franchise involve \"smart toys,\" consisting of action figures and accessories, along with an electronic \"portal,\" which, when used with a figure or accessory, allows a player to store and access information about his or her performance in the game. We sell the action figures and accessories both bundled with the software for the title and on a stand-alone basis. Consumers may not want to buy the related software if they cannot also buy the \"smart toys\" or accessories. If we underestimate demand or otherwise are unable to produce sufficient quantities of toys or accessories of an acceptable quality or allocate too few toys or accessories to geographic markets where demand exceeds supply, we will forego revenues. This may also create greater opportunities for competitors to develop competitive product offerings. In addition, if we overestimate demand and make too many toys or accessories, or allocate too many toys or accessories to geographic markets where there is\ninsufficient demand, we may incur unrecoverable manufacturing costs for unsold units as well as for unsold game software. In either case, unsound toy and accessory manufacturing or allocation decisions may negatively impact our business.\nThe importance to our business of the \"smart toys\" related to our Skylanders franchise exposes us to hardware manufacturing and shipping risks, including availability of sufficient third-party manufacturing capacity and increases in manufacturing and shipping costs.\nThe majority of the manufacturers of the \"smart toys\" involved in our Skylanders franchise are located in China. Anything that impacts our ability to import these products or the ability of those manufacturers to produce or otherwise supply us with toys meeting our quality and safety standards or increases the manufacturers' costs of production may adversely impact our ability to supply those toys to the market and the prices we must pay for those toys. Examples of such impacts include: the utilization of any such manufacturer's capacity by another company, changes in safety, environmental or other regulations applicable to the toys and the manufacturing thereof, natural or manmade disasters that disrupt manufacturing, transportation or communications, labor shortages, civil unrest or issues generally negatively impacting international companies operating in China, increases in the price of petroleum or other raw materials, increases in fuel prices and other shipping costs, and increases in local labor costs in China. Moreover, the failure of those manufacturers to consistently deliver action figures and portals meeting the quality and safety standards we require could negatively impact our business.\nTransitions in console platforms could adversely affect the market for interactive entertainment software.\nNintendo introduced its next-generation console, the Wii U, in 2012, and Sony and Microsoft each launched its next-generation console-the PS4 and Xbox One, respectively-in November 2013. We are developing and publishing games for these next-generation console systems. When new console platforms are announced or introduced into the market, consumers typically reduce their purchases of game console entertainment software products for prior console platforms in anticipation of purchasing a new platform and products for that platform. During these periods, sales of the game console entertainment software products we publish may decline until new platforms achieve wide consumer acceptance. Platform transitions may have a comparable impact on sales of downloadable content, amplifying the impact on our revenues. This decline may not be offset by increased sales of products for the new console platforms. Conversely, actions we take to curtail the reduction of purchases of products for prior console platforms during the transition may harm sales of products we publish for prior-generation platforms. In addition, as console hardware moves through its life cycle, hardware manufacturers typically enact price reductions and decreasing prices may put downward pressure on software prices. During platform transitions, we may simultaneously incur costs both in continuing to develop and market new titles for prior-generation video game platforms, which may not sell at premium prices, and also in developing products for next-generation platforms, which may not generate immediate or near-term revenues. As a result, our business and operating results may be more volatile and difficult to predict during platform transitions than during other times.\nOur business is highly dependent on the success, timely release and availability of new video game platforms and on the continued availability of, and support for, existing video game platforms, as well as our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of products for play on video game platforms manufactured by third parties, such as Microsoft's Xbox One and Xbox 360, Nintendo's Wii U and Wii, and Sony's PS4 and PS3. For example, sales of products for consoles accounted for 49% of our consolidated net revenues in 2014. The success of our business is driven in large part by our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be successful in the marketplace, our ability to\ndevelop commercially successful products for these platforms, the availability of an adequate supply of these video game platforms and the continued support for these platforms by their manufacturers. We must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of the anticipated introduction of a new platform.\nWe must make significant expenditures to develop products for new platforms that may not be successful.\nWe must make substantial product development and other investments in a particular platform well in advance of introduction of the platform and may be required to realign our product portfolio and development efforts in response to market changes. Furthermore, development costs for new console platforms are greater than those costs for the then-current console platforms. If increased costs are not offset by higher revenues and other cost efficiencies, our business could be negatively impacted. If the platforms for which we develop new software products or modify existing products do not attain significant market penetration, we may not be able to recover our development costs, which could be significant.\nPlatform licensors are our competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of, and have broad approval rights over, our console and handheld interactive entertainment products.\nGenerally, when we develop interactive entertainment software products for hardware platforms offered by Microsoft, Nintendo, or Sony, the products are manufactured exclusively by that hardware manufacturer or their approved replicator.\nThe agreements with these manufacturers include certain provisions, such as approval rights over all software products and related promotional materials and the ability to change the fee they charge for the manufacturing of products, which allow them substantial influence over the cost and the release schedule of such interactive entertainment software products. In addition, because each of the manufacturers is also a publisher of games for its own hardware platforms and manufactures products for all of its other licensees, a manufacturer may give priority to its own products or those of our competitors in the event of insufficient manufacturing capacity. Accordingly, Microsoft, Nintendo or Sony could cause unanticipated delays in the release of our products as well as increases to projected development, manufacturing, marketing or distribution costs, any of which could negatively impact our business.\nIn addition, platform licensors control our ability to provide online game capabilities for console platform products and, in large part, establish the financial terms and/or pricing on which these products and services are offered to consumers. Currently, Microsoft provides online capabilities for the Xbox One and Xbox 360, Nintendo provides online capabilities for the Wii U and Wii, and Sony provides online capabilities for the PS4 and PS3. In each case, compatibility code and/or the consent of the licensor are required for us to include online capabilities in its console products. The failure or refusal of licensors to approve our products could negatively impact our business.\nWe must negotiate with platform licensors to agree upon the royalty rates and other fees that must be paid to publish games for their platforms or distribute games on their networks, and therefore they can have significant influence on our costs.\nWe pay a licensing fee to the hardware manufacturer for each copy of a product manufactured for that manufacturer's game platform. The platform license agreements we enter into with those manufacturers specify the fee and/or price that we must pay in order to publish games for that platform. Similarly, the platform licensors control the retail pricing for games and additional content purchased over their networks. The control that platform licensors have over the fee structures and/or pricing for their platforms and online networks could impact the volume of purchases of our products made over their network and our profitability. It is also possible that platform licensors will not renew\nour existing licenses. Any increase in fee structures and/or pricing, or nonrenewal of licenses, could have a negative impact on our business, particularly for Activision, as the publishing of products for console systems is the largest portion of Activision's business.\nOutside of fee arrangements, our agreement with a manufacturer typically gives it significant control over other aspects of the distribution of our products and services that we develop for that manufacturer's game platform. If the manufacturer establishes terms that restrict our offerings on its platform, or significantly impact the financial terms on which these products or services are offered to our customers, we may be unable to distribute our products or be forced to do so on a materially worse financial or business terms.\nIf we do not continue to attract and retain skilled personnel, we will be unable to effectively conduct our business.\nOne of our most essential assets is our employees and, as such, our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to identify, hire, retain and utilize the abilities of qualified personnel, particularly personnel with the specialized skills needed to create and sell the high-quality, well-received titles upon which our business is substantially dependent. The software industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting among competitors for employees with technical, marketing, sales, engineering, product development, creative and/or management skills. We may have difficulties in attracting and retaining skilled personnel or may incur significant costs in order to do so. If we are unable to attract additional qualified employees or retain and utilize the services of key personnel, it could have a negative impact on our business.\nOur reputation with consumers is critical to our success. Negative consumer perceptions about our brands, games, services and/or business practices may damage our business and any costs incurred in addressing consumer concerns may increase our operating expenses.\nIndividual consumers form our ultimate customer base, and consumer expectations regarding the quality, performance and integrity of our products and services are high. Consumers may be critical of our brands, games, services and/or business practices for a wide variety of reasons. These negative consumer reactions may not be foreseeable or within our control to manage effectively. Actions we take to address consumer concerns may be costly and, in any case, may not be successful. In addition, negative consumer sentiment about our business practices may result in inquiries or investigations from regulatory agencies and consumer groups, as well as litigation, which, regardless of their outcome, may be damaging to our reputation. Any of these may have a negative impact on our business.\nIf our games and services do not function as consumers expect, it may have a negative impact on our business.\nIf our games and services do not function as consumers expect, whether because they fail to function as advertised or otherwise, our sales may suffer. The risk that this may occur is particularly pronounced with respect to our games with online features, like World of Warcraft games, Call of Duty games, Destiny and Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, because they involve ongoing consumer expectations, which we may not be able to successfully satisfy. If our games and services do not function as consumers expect, it may negatively impact our business.\nThe future success of our business depends on our ability to release popular products in a timely manner.\nThe life of any given console or handheld game product is relatively short and generally involves a relatively high level of sales during the first few months after the product's introduction, followed by a rapid decline in sales. Because revenues associated with an initial product launch generally constitute a high percentage of the total revenues associated with the life of a product, delays in product releases or\ndisruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and reputation and could cause our results of operations to be materially different from expectations. It is therefore important for us to continue to develop many high-quality new products that are popularly received and to release those products in a timely manner. If we are unable to continue to do so, it may negatively impact our business.\nIf we are unable to sustain traditional pricing levels for our titles, our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows or liquidity could suffer materially.\nIf we are unable to sustain traditional pricing levels for our titles, whether due to competitive pressure, because retailers elect to price these products at a lower price or otherwise, it could have a negative impact on our business. Further, we make provisions for retail inventory price protection based upon certain assumed lowest prices and if competitive pressures force us to lower our prices below those levels, it could similarly have a negative impact on our business.\nIf we fail to successfully manage our new product development, or if we fail to anticipate the issues associated with that development, it may negatively impact our business.\nOur business models are evolving and we believe that our growth will depend, in part, upon our ability to successfully develop and sell new types of products, including free-to-play games which are monetized through in-game microtransactions rather than an up-front fee, and to otherwise expand the methods by which we reach our consumers, including via digital distribution. Developing new products and distribution channels requires substantial up-front expenditures. Further, forecasting our revenues and profitability for these new business models is inherently uncertain and volatile. If such products or distribution channels do not achieve expected acceptance or generate sufficient revenues upon introduction, whether because of competition or otherwise, we may not recover the cost of our investments in developing and marketing those products and distribution channels, or recover the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from other products or distribution channels. In addition, expanding our business models will add complexity to our business and require us to effectively adapt our business and management processes to address the unique challenges and different requirements of any new areas in which we operate, which we may not be able to do, for lack of institutional expertise or otherwise.\nOur industry is subject to rapid technological change, and if we do not adapt to, and appropriately allocate our new resources among, emerging technologies and business models, our business may be negatively impacted.\nTechnology changes rapidly in the interactive entertainment industry. We must continually anticipate and adapt our products to emerging technologies, delivery platforms and business models in order to stay competitive. When we choose to incorporate a new technology into a product or to develop a product for a new platform, operating system or media format, we often are required to make a substantial investment prior to the introduction of the product. If we invest in the development of interactive entertainment products incorporating a new technology or for a new platform that does not achieve significant commercial success, our revenues from those products likely will be lower than we anticipated and may not cover our development costs. Further, our competitors may adapt to an emerging technology or business model more quickly or effectively than we do, creating products that are technologically superior to ours, more appealing to consumers, or both. If, on the other hand, we elect not to pursue the development of products incorporating a new technology or for new platforms, or otherwise elect not to pursue a new business model, that achieves significant commercial success, it may have adverse consequences. It may take significant time and resources to shift product development resources to that technology, platform or business model, as the case may be, and may be more difficult to compete against existing products incorporating that technology or for that platform\nor against companies using that business model. For example, digital content delivery is increasingly important in our industry, requiring us to develop or acquire the expertise in such delivery method needed to remain competitive. Any failure to successfully adapt to, and appropriately allocate resources among, emerging technologies could negatively impact our business.\nThe increasing importance of digital sales to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model, including greater competition.\nThe proportion of our revenues derived from digital content delivery, as compared to traditional retail sales, continues to increase. The increased importance of digital content delivery in our industry increases our potential competition, as the minimum capital needed to produce and publish a digitally delivered game, particularly a new game for the emerging mobile platform, may be significantly less than that needed to produce and publish one that is purchased through retail distribution and is played on a game console. Shifting to digital delivery of our products also requires us to dedicate capital to developing and implementing alternative marketing strategies, which we may not do successfully. If any of this occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows or liquidity. In addition, a continuing shift to digital delivery could result in a deprioritization of our products by traditional retailers and distributors, giving rise to the same material adverse effects.\nThe increasing prevalence of free-to-play games exposes us to risks from that business model.\nWe expect that the portion of the total revenues of the interactive entertainment industry, and of our revenues, generated by free-to-play entertainment products, which are monetized through in-game microtransactions rather than an up-front fee, will continue to increase. We may invest in the development of free-to-play interactive entertainment products that do not achieve significant commercial success, in which case our revenues from those products likely will be lower than anticipated and we may not recover our development costs. Even if our free-to-play games are initially well-received, we may not be able to generate or sustain consumer engagement sufficient to generate significant revenues, if any, through in-game microtransactions. Publishing free-to-play games also requires us to dedicate capital to developing and implementing alternative marketing strategies, which we may not do successfully. In addition, a continuing shift to free-to-play games could result in a deprioritization of our products by traditional retailers and distributors.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop or market owned intellectual property, we may publish fewer successful titles and our revenues may decline.\nSome of our products are based on intellectual property that we have developed internally or acquired from third parties. Consumers have historically preferred titles which are part of established franchises to titles based on new intellectual property. If a new intellectual property does not gain consumer acceptance, whether because we are unable to successfully create consumer appeal and brand recognition or for other reasons, our business could be negatively impacted. Further, if the popularity of our owned intellectual property declines, we may have to write off the unrecovered portion of the underlying intellectual property assets and revenues and operating income from these intellectual properties may decline quickly, either of which could negatively impact our business.\nCompetition within, and to, the interactive entertainment industry is intense, and competitors may succeed in reducing our sales.\nWithin the interactive entertainment industry, we compete with other publishers of interactive entertainment software developed for use on the PC, video game consoles and handheld, mobile and tablet devices or social networking sites, both within the United States and, increasingly, in international jurisdictions. Our competitors include very large corporations with significantly greater financial, marketing and product development resources than we have. For example, integrated video game console hardware and software companies such as Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony, compete directly with us in the development of software titles for their respective platforms. A relatively small number of titles account for a significant portion of net revenues, and an even greater portion of net profit, in the interactive entertainment industry, and the availability of significant financial resources is a major competitive factor in the production of high-quality products and in the marketing of products that are ultimately well-received. Our larger competitors may be able to leverage their greater financial, technical, personnel and other resources to finance larger budgets for development and marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially desirable properties as well as adopt more aggressive pricing policies to develop more commercially successful products for the PC or video game platforms than we do. In addition, competitors with large product lines and popular titles typically have greater leverage with retailers, distributors and other customers, who may be willing to promote titles with less consumer appeal in return for access to those competitors' more popular titles.\nIncreased consumer acceptance and availability of interactive entertainment developed for use by consumers on handheld, mobile and tablet devices or social networking sites or other online games, consumer acceptance and availability of technology which allows users to play games on televisions without consoles, or technological advances in online game software or the Internet could result in a decline in sales of our platform-based software.\nAdditionally, we compete with other forms of entertainment and leisure activities. For example, the overall growth in the use of the Internet and online services such as social networking sites by consumers may pose a competitive threat if consumers and potential consumers spend less of their available time using interactive entertainment software and more using the Internet, including those online services. Further, it is difficult to predict and prepare for rapid changes in consumer demand that could materially alter public preferences for different forms of entertainment and leisure activities. Failure to adequately identify and adapt to the competitive pressures described herein could negatively impact our business.\nThe development of high-quality products requires substantial up-front expenditures, and we may not be able to recover those costs for our future products.\nConsumer preferences for games are usually cyclical and difficult to predict, and even the most successful titles remain popular for only limited periods of time, unless refreshed with new content or otherwise enhanced. In order to remain competitive, we must continuously develop new products or enhancements to existing products. The amount of lead time and cost involved in the development of high-quality products is increasing, and the longer the lead time involved in developing a product and the greater the allocation of financial resources to such product, the more critical it is that we accurately predict consumer demand for such product. If our future products do not achieve expected consumer acceptance or generate sufficient revenues upon introduction, we may not be able to recover the substantial development and marketing costs associated with those products.\nWe may overestimate demand for a product, incurring unrecoverable manufacturing costs.\nWe pay a licensing fee to the hardware manufacturer for each copy of a product manufactured for that manufacturer's game platform, regardless of whether that product is sold. If we overestimate\ndemand and make too many physical \"boxed\" copies of any title, we will incur unrecoverable manufacturing costs for unsold units.\nWe are exposed to seasonality in the sale of our products.\nThe interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal, with the highest levels of consumer demand occurring during the year-end holiday buying season in the fourth quarter of the year. As a result, our sales have historically been highest during the second half of the year, particularly for our Activision segment. Receivables and credit risk are likewise higher during the second half of the year, as retailers increase their purchases of our products in anticipation of the holiday season. Delays in development, licensor approvals or manufacturing can affect the timing of the release of products, causing us to miss key selling periods such as the year-end holiday buying season.\nIf our proprietary online game service, Battle.net, does not function properly, our business may be negatively impacted.\nIf Blizzard's proprietary online game service, Battle.net, does not function as anticipated, Blizzard's games may be completely unavailable or Blizzard may be prevented from delivering content digitally, which could result in a loss of sales for Blizzard's games. Further, any disruption in Battle.net's services could negatively impact our business.\nWe depend on servers to operate our games with online features, such as World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, Destiny and Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, as well as Battle.net, our digital service with online features. If we were to lose server functionality, for any reason, our business could suffer.\nOur business relies on the continuous operation of data servers. Although we strive to maintain more than sufficient server capacity, and provide for active redundancy in the event of limited hardware failure, any broad-based catastrophic server malfunction, a significant intrusion by hackers that circumvents security measures, a failure of disaster recovery service or the failure of a company on which we are relying for server capacity to provide that capacity for whatever reason would likely interrupt the operation of World of Warcraft or Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft or degrade or interrupt the functionality of other games of ours with online features, such as Call of Duty games and Destiny, and could result in the loss of sales for such games (including subscription-based sales for World of Warcraft). An extended interruption of service could negatively impact our business.\nWe must project our future server needs and make advance purchases of servers or server capacity to accommodate expected business demands. If we underestimate the amount of server capacity our business requires or if our business were to grow more quickly than expected, our consumers may experience service problems, such as slow or interrupted gaming access. Insufficient server capacity may result in decreased sales, a loss of our consumer base and adverse consequences to our reputation. Conversely, if we overestimate the amount of server capacity required by our business, we may incur additional operating costs.\nIn addition, we rely on the networks operated by third parties, such as Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network, for the sale and digital delivery of our downloadable content. In the event the efficient operation and functionality of these third-party networks is interrupted, it could have a negative impact on the timing or level of our sales through digital delivery.\nWe may not accurately predict the amount of Internet bandwidth or computational resources necessary to sustain our online gaming businesses.\nOur online gaming businesses are dependent on the availability of sufficient Internet bandwidth and computational resources. If the price of either such resource increases, we may not be able to increase our prices or subscriber levels to compensate for such costs. Because of the importance of our\nonline business to our revenues and results of operations, our ability to access adequate bandwidth and online computational resources to support our business is critical.\nTo secure access to such resources, we have entered into arrangements with several providers to secure future capacity, some of which involve long-term contracts. If the price of such resource were to decrease, our contractual commitments to pay higher prices could affect our ability to compete with other publishers of interactive software products paying lower prices. Further, because we purchase additional capacity based on anticipated growth, our capacity is sometimes larger than necessary to sustain our existing needs. If our projected online business growth is delayed or does not occur, we will incur larger expenses for such resources than necessary. Conversely, if we underestimate the amount of bandwidth that our online business requires, and our purchased capacity is insufficient to meet demand, our business may be negatively impacted.\nWe may be involved in legal proceedings that may result in material adverse outcomes.\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in claims, suits, government investigations, audits and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business, including actions with respect to intellectual property, competition and antitrust matters, privacy matters, tax matters, labor and employment matters, unclaimed property matters, compliance and commercial claims. Such claims, suits, government investigations, audits and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products or services, requiring us to change our development process or other business practices.\nLegal proceedings relating to the Purchase Transaction and Private Sale may result in adverse outcomes.\nWe are currently subject to various claims in connection with the Purchase Transaction and Private Sale, and in the future may be subject to additional claims related thereto. The currently asserted claims are covered by a proposed settlement, which remains subject to approval by the Delaware Court of Chancery. Such proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, monitoring and defending against legal actions is time consuming for our management and detracts from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our business activities. In addition, we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with litigation and, although coverage may be available under relevant insurance policies, coverage could be denied or prove to be insufficient. Under our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our officers and directors, the Company may be required in certain circumstances to indemnify and advance expenses to them in connection with their participation in proceedings arising out of their service to us. There can be no assurance that any of these payments will not be material. Although unlikely, a decision adverse to the Company on these actions could also result in the reformation of the Stockholders Agreement (as described in further detail under \"Legal Proceedings\").\nWe may be subject to intellectual property claims.\nAs the number of interactive entertainment software products increases and the features and content of these products continue to overlap, software developers have increasingly become subject to infringement claims. Further, many of our products are highly realistic and feature materials that are based on real world things or people, which may also be the subject of intellectual property infringement claims of others, including right of publicity claims. In addition, our products often utilize complex, cutting-edge technology that may become subject to emerging intellectual property rights of\nothers. Although we take steps to avoid knowingly violating the intellectual property rights of others, it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement, particularly since there are an increasing number of companies that focus their efforts exclusively on enforcing their patent rights.\nFrom time to time, we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims. Existing or future infringement claims against us, whether valid or not, may be time consuming, distracting to management and expensive to defend. Further, intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022 cease selling, incorporating, supporting or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022 obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property, which if available at all, may not be available on commercially favorable terms;\n\u2022 redesign the affected interactive entertainment software products, which could result in additional costs, delay introduction and possibly reduce commercial appeal of the affected products; or\n\u2022 pay damages to the holder of the infringed intellectual property for past infringements.\nIssues with Skylanders toys and accessories may lead to product liability, personal injury or property damage claims, recalls, replacements of products, or regulatory actions by governmental authorities.\nWe may experience issues with Skylanders toys and accessories that may lead to product liability, personal injury or property damage claims, recalls, replacements of products, or regulatory actions by governmental authorities. Any of these activities could result in increased governmental scrutiny, harm to our reputation, reduced demand by consumers for our products, decreased willingness by our customers to purchase or by our partners to provide marketing support for those products, denial or increased cost for insurance coverage, or additional safety and testing requirements. Such results could divert development and management resources and increase legal fees and other costs, and otherwise could negatively impact our business.\nOur products may be subject to legal claims.\nIn prior years, lawsuits have been filed against numerous interactive entertainment companies, including against Activision Blizzard, by the families of victims of violence, alleging that interactive entertainment products influence the behavior of the perpetrators of such violence. These lawsuits have been dismissed, but similar additional lawsuits may be filed in the future. Although our general liability insurance carrier has agreed to defend lawsuits of this nature with respect to the prior lawsuits, it is uncertain whether insurance carriers would do so in the future, or if such insurance carriers would cover all or any amounts for which we might be liable if such future lawsuits are not decided in our favor. Further, any such lawsuit could result in increased governmental scrutiny, harm to our reputation, reduced demand by consumers for our products, or decreased willingness by our customers to purchase or by our partners to provide marketing support for those products. Such results could divert development and management resources, increase legal fees and other costs and have other negative impacts on our business.\nOur products are subject to the threat of piracy and unauthorized copying, and inadequate intellectual property laws and other protections could prevent us from enforcing or defending our proprietary technologies. We may also face legal risks arising out of user-generated content.\nWe regard our software as proprietary and rely on a variety of methods, including a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, to protect our proprietary rights. We own or license various copyrights, patents, trademarks\nand trade secrets. We are aware that some unauthorized copying occurs, and if a significantly greater amount of unauthorized copying of our software products were to occur, it could negatively impact our business.\nPolicing unauthorized sale, distribution and use of our products is difficult, and software piracy (including online piracy) is a persistent problem for us. Further, the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be distributed either do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, or are poorly enforced. Legal protection of our rights may be ineffective in such countries. In addition, though we take steps to make the unauthorized sale, distribution and use of our products more difficult and to otherwise enforce and police our rights, as do the manufacturers of consoles and the operators of other platforms on which many of our games are played, our efforts and the efforts of the console manufacturers and platform operators may not be successful in controlling the piracy of our products in all instances. The proliferation of technology designed to circumvent the protection measures used in our products, the availability of broadband access to the Internet, the refusal of Internet service providers to remove infringing content in certain instances, the ability to download pirated copies of games from various Internet sites and peer-to-peer networks, and the widespread proliferation of Internet cafes using pirated copies of our products all have contributed to an expansion in piracy.\nWe also cannot be certain that existing intellectual property laws will provide adequate protection for our products in connection with emerging technologies.\nWe rely on external developers to develop some of our software products.\nWe rely on external software developers to develop some of our software products. Because we depend on these developers, we are subject to the following risks:\n\u2022 continuing strong demand for top-tier developers' resources, combined with the recognition they receive in connection with their work, may cause developers who worked for us in the past either to work for a competitor in the future or to renegotiate agreements with us on terms less favorable to us;\n\u2022 limited financial resources and business expertise and inability to retain skilled personnel may force developers out of business prior to completing products or require us to fund additional costs; and\n\u2022 a competitor may acquire the businesses of key developers or sign them to exclusive development arrangements and, in either case, we would not be able to continue to engage such developers' services for our products, except for any period of time for which those developers are contractually obligated to complete development for us.\nIncreased competition for skilled third-party software developers also has compelled us to agree to make significant advance payments on royalties to game developers. If the products subject to these arrangements do not generate sufficient revenues to recover these royalty advances, we would have to write-off unrecovered portions of these payments, which could negatively impact our business. Typically, we pay developers a royalty based on a percentage of net revenues from product sales, less agreed upon deductions, but from time to time, we have agreed to pay developers fixed per unit product royalties after royalty advances are fully recouped. To the extent that sales prices of products on which we have agreed to pay a fixed per unit royalty are marked down, it could negatively impact our business.\nOur sales may decline substantially without warning and in a brief period of time because a substantial portion of our sales are made to a relatively small number of key customers and because we do not have long-term contracts for the sale of our products.\nIn the United States and Canada, our \"boxed\" products are often sold on a direct basis to mass-market retailers, consumer electronics stores, discount warehouses and game specialty stores. Our \"boxed\" products are sold internationally on a direct-to-retail basis, through third-party distribution and licensing arrangements, and through our wholly-owned European distribution subsidiaries. Our sales are made primarily on a purchase order basis without long-term agreements or other forms of commitments, and our retail customers and distributors have generally been reducing the levels of inventory they are willing to carry. The loss of, or significant reduction in sales to, any of Activision's principal retail customers or distributors could have adverse consequences. The concentration of sales in a small number of large customers also makes us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these large customers becomes unable to pay for our products or seeks protection under the bankruptcy laws. In addition, having such a large portion of our total net revenues concentrated in a few customers reduces our negotiating leverage with these customers.\nOur business may be harmed if our distributors, retailers, development and licensing partners, or other parties with which we do business become unable to honor their existing financial obligations to us or seek protection under the bankruptcy laws.\nSome of our business partners are highly-leveraged or small businesses that may be particularly vulnerable to difficult economic conditions. As a result of current economic conditions in some parts of the world, we are subject to heightened counterparty risks, including the risks that our business partners may default on their obligations to us or seek protection under the bankruptcy laws.\nFor example, retailers and distributors in the interactive entertainment industry have from time to time experienced significant fluctuations in their businesses and a number of them have failed. We typically make sales to most retailers and some distributors on unsecured credit, with terms that vary depending upon the customer's credit history, solvency, credit limits and sales history, as well as prevailing terms with similarly situated customers and whether sufficient credit insurance can be obtained. Challenging economic conditions may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products they have purchased, and as a result, our reserves for doubtful accounts and write-off of accounts receivable could increase and, even if increased, may turn out to be insufficient. Moreover, even in cases where we have insolvency risk insurance to protect against a customer's bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation, this insurance typically contains a significant deductible and co-payment obligation, and does not cover all instances of non-payment. Further, the insolvency or business failure of other types of business partners could result in disruptions to the manufacturing or distribution of our products or the cancellation of contractual arrangements that we consider to be favorable. A payment default by, or the insolvency or business failure of, a significant business partner could negatively impact our business.\nOur business may be harmed if our distributors, retailers, development and licensing partners, or other parties with which we do business act in ways that place our brand at risk.\nThe actions of our business partners may put our business and our reputation at risk. In many cases, these third parties are given access to sensitive and proprietary information in order to provide services and support our team. These third parties may misappropriate our information and engage in unauthorized use of it. The failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies, or the failure of third parties to adequately maintain or update their services and technologies, could result in a disruption to our business operations, and may impact the perception of our titles or our business reputation and brand value.\nOur business is subject to the risks and uncertainties of international trade.\nWe conduct business throughout the world, and we derive a substantial amount of revenues and profits from international trade, particularly from Europe, Asia and Australia. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues and profits in the future and, moreover, that sales in emerging markets in Asia and elsewhere will be an increasingly important part of our international sales.\nAs such, we are, and may be increasingly, subject to risks inherent in foreign trade generally, as well as risks inherent in doing business in emerging markets, including increased tariffs and duties, compliance with economic sanctions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, shipping delays, increases in transportation costs, international political, regulatory and economic developments and differing local business practices, all of which may impact operating margins or make it more difficult, if not impossible, for us to conduct business in foreign markets.\nA deterioration in relations between either us or the United States and any country in which we have significant operations or sales, or the implementation of government regulations in such a country, including China in particular, could result in the adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, including economic sanctions, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows or liquidity. For instance, to operate in China, World of Warcraft, Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, StarCraft II, Call of Duty Online and all other games must have regulatory approval. A decision by the Chinese government to revoke its approval for any of our games or to decline to approve any products we desire to sell in China in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows or liquidity. Additionally, in the past, legislation has been implemented in China that has required modifications to World of Warcraft and other software. The future implementation of similar laws or regulations in China or any other country in which we have operations or sales may require engineering modifications to our products that are not cost-effective, if even feasible at all, or could degrade the consumer experience to the point where consumers cease to purchase such products.\nWe are also subject to risks that our operations outside the United States could be conducted by our employees, contractors, third-party partners, representatives or agents in ways that violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act or other similar anti-bribery laws. While we have policies and procedures, as well as training for our employees, intended to secure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors, third-party partners, representatives or agents may take actions that violate our policies. Moreover, it may be more difficult to oversee the conduct of any such persons who are not our employees, potentially exposing us to greater risk from their actions.\nIn addition, cultural differences may affect consumer preferences and limit the international popularity of titles that are popular in the U.S or require us to modify the content of the games or the method by which we charge our customers for the games in order to be successful. If we do not correctly assess consumer preferences in the countries in which we sell our products, or if the other risks discussed herein come to fruition, it could negatively impact our business.\nChanges in tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows or liquidity.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and in various other jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, and in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are required to estimate future taxes. Although we currently believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the estimation process is inherently uncertain, and such estimates are not binding on tax authorities. Further, our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business, including the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax\nrates, changes in tax elections, and changes in applicable tax laws. Additionally, tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision. Should the ultimate tax liability exceed estimates, our income tax provision and net income could be materially adversely affected.\nWe earn a significant amount of our operating income, and hold a significant portion of our cash and investments, outside the United States. While our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the United States, any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions would likely result in higher effective tax rates for the Company. In addition, there have been proposals to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether, or in what form, this proposed legislation will pass, if enacted it could negatively impact our business.\nWe are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property, and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various other jurisdictions. Tax authorities regularly examine these non-income taxes. The outcomes from these examinations, changes in the business, changes in applicable tax rules or other tax matters may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows or liquidity.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows or liquidity.\nWe transact business in various currencies other than the U.S. dollar and have significant international sales and expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, subjecting us to currency exchange rate risks. A substantial portion of our international sales and expenses are denominated in local currencies, including certain major currencies, such as the euro and British pound, and emerging market currencies, such as the South Korean won and Chinese renminbi, which could fluctuate against the U.S. dollar. Since we have significant international sales, but incur the majority of our costs in the United States, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may have an asymmetric and disproportional impact on our business. We have, in the past, utilized currency derivative contracts to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures, with hedge maturities of generally less than 12 months, and managed these exposures with natural offsets. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue our hedging programs, or that we will be successful in managing exposure to currency exchange rate risks whether or not we do so.\nOur reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves.\nOur reported financial results are impacted by the accounting policies promulgated by the SEC and national accounting standards bodies and the methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies. Policies affecting revenue recognition have and could further significantly affect the way we report revenues related to our products and services. We recognize a majority of the revenues from bundled sales (i.e., packaged goods video games that include an online service component) on a deferred basis over an estimated service period for such games. In addition, we defer the costs of sales of those titles. We expect that an increasing number of our games will be online-enabled in the future and that we could be required to recognize the related revenues over a period of time rather than at the time of sale. Further, as we increase our downloadable content and add new features to our online services, our estimate of the service period may change and we could be required to recognize revenues, and defer related costs, over a shorter or longer period of time. As we enhance, expand and diversify our business and product offerings, the application of existing or future financial accounting standards, particularly those relating to the way we account for revenues and taxes,\ncould have an adverse effect on our reported net revenues, net income and earnings per share under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States in any given period.\nWe may permit our customers to return products and to receive pricing concessions which could negatively impact our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of product returns and price protection with respect to our distributors and retailers. In some cases, return policies allow distributors and retailers to return defective, shelf-worn, damaged and certain other products in accordance with terms granted. Price protection, when granted and applicable, allows these distributors and retailers a credit against amounts owed with respect to merchandise unsold by them. We may permit product returns from, or grant price protection to, our customers under certain conditions. These conditions may include compliance with applicable payment terms, delivery of weekly inventory and sales information and consistent participation in the launches of premium title releases. We may also consider other factors, including the facilitation of slow-moving inventory and other industry factors. When we offer price protection, it may be offered with respect to a particular product to all of our distributors and retailer customers who meet the applicable conditions. Activision also offers a 90-day limited warranty to its consumer end users that Activision products will be free from manufacturing defects. Although we maintain a reserve for returns and price protection, and although we may place limits on product returns and price protection, we could be forced to accept substantial product returns and provide substantial price protection to maintain our relationships with retailers and our access to distribution channels. We face similar issues and risks, including exposure to risk of chargebacks, with respect to consumer end users to whom we sell products directly, whether through Battle.net or otherwise.\nWe may face difficulty obtaining access to the retail shelf space necessary to market and sell our products effectively.\nRetailers typically have a limited amount of shelf space and promotional resources, and there is intense competition among consumer interactive entertainment software products for high-quality retail shelf space and promotional support from retailers. To the extent that the number of products and platforms increase, competition for shelf space may intensify and may require us to increase our marketing expenditures. Those issues are exacerbated to the extent any of our products involve physical goods in addition to software and, as such, require additional shelf space, like the titles in our Skylanders franchise, which include both action figures and accessories, as well as an electronic \"portal\". Retailers with limited shelf space typically devote the most and highest quality shelf space to those products expected to be best sellers. We cannot be certain that our new products will consistently achieve such \"best seller\" status. Due to increased competition for limited shelf space, retailers and distributors are in an increasingly better position to negotiate favorable terms of sale, including price discounts, price protection, marketing and display fees and product return policies. Our products constitute a relatively small percentage of most retailers' sales volume. We cannot be certain that retailers will continue to purchase our products or provide those products with adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support on acceptable terms.\nIf our marketing and advertising efforts fail to resonate with our consumers, our business could be negatively impacted.\nOur products are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs. Our ability to sell our products and services is dependent in part upon the success of these programs. If the marketing for our products and services fails to resonate with our consumers, particularly during the critical holiday season or during other key selling periods, or advertising rates or other media placement costs increase, these factors could have a negative impact on our business.\nIncreased sales of used interactive entertainment products could lower our sales.\nCertain of our larger customers sell used interactive entertainment products, which are generally priced lower than new interactive entertainment products and do not result in any revenues to the publisher of the games. Sales of used interactive entertainment products could negatively affect our sales of new products.\nOur products are subject to ratings by the Entertainment Software Rating Board in the U.S. and similar agencies in international jurisdictions. Our failure to obtain our target ratings for our products could negatively impact our business.\nThe Entertainment Software Rating Board (the \"ESRB\") is a self-regulatory body based in the United States that provides consumers of interactive entertainment software with ratings information, including information on the content in such software, such as violence, nudity or sexual content contained in software titles. The ESRB rating categories are \"Early Childhood\" (i.e., content is intended for young children), \"Everyone\" (i.e., content is generally suitable for all ages), \"Everyone 10+\" (i.e., content is generally suitable for ages 10 and up), \"Teen\" (i.e., content is generally suitable for ages 13 and up), \"Mature\" (i.e., content is generally suitable for ages 17 and up) and \"Adults Only\" (i.e., content is suitable for adults ages 18 and up). Certain of our most significant titles have received a \"Mature\" rating, inherently limiting the target audience. Certain countries other than the United States have also established content rating systems as prerequisites for product sales in those countries. In some countries, a company may be required to modify its products to comply with the requirements of the rating systems, which could delay or disrupt the release of any given product, or may prevent its sale altogether in certain territories. Further, if an agency re-rates one of our games for any reason, retailers could refuse to sell it and demand that we accept the return of any unsold or returned copies or consumers could demand a refund for copies purchased. If we are unable to obtain the ratings we have targeted for our products as a result of changes in a content rating organization's ratings standards or for other reasons, it could have a negative impact on our business.\nAdditional content-related policies adopted by retailers could negatively affect sales of our products.\nRetailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing what they judge to be graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other content that they deem inappropriate for their businesses, whether because a product received a certain rating by the ESRB or other content rating system, or otherwise. If retailers decline to sell our products based upon their opinion that they contain objectionable themes, graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other generally objectionable content, we might be required to either: significantly change or discontinue particular titles or series or forfeit the revenue opportunity of selling our product with that retailer.\nOur business, products, and distribution are subject to increasing regulation of content in key territories. If we do not successfully respond to these regulations, our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows or liquidity could be materially adversely affected.\nLegislation is continually being introduced, and litigation and regulatory enforcement actions are taking place, that may affect the way in which we, and other industry participants, may offer content and features, and distribute and advertise our products. For example, privacy laws and regulatory guidance in many countries impose various restrictions on online and mobile advertising, as well as the collection, storage and use of personally identifiable information. We may be required to modify certain of our product development processes or alter our marketing strategies to comply with such regulations, which could be costly or delay the release of our products. In addition, many foreign countries, such as China and Germany, have laws that permit governmental entities to restrict the content and/or advertising of interactive entertainment software or prohibit certain types of content. Further, legislation which attempts to restrict marketing or distribution of such products because of the\ncontent therein has been introduced at one time or another at the federal and state levels in the United States. There is on-going risk of enhanced regulation of interactive entertainment marketing, content or sales. These laws and regulations vary by territory and may be inconsistent with one another, imposing conflicting or uncertain restrictions. The adoption and enforcement of legislation which restricts the marketing, content or sales of our products in countries in which we do business may harm the sales of our products, as the products we are able to offer to our customers and the size of the potential market for our products may be limited. Failure to comply with any applicable legislation may also result in government-imposed fines or other penalties. Moreover, the increased public dialogue concerning interactive entertainment may have an adverse impact on our reputation and consumers' willingness to purchase our products.\nWe may not be able to maintain our distribution relationships with key vendors and customers.\nOur NBG and Centresoft subsidiaries distribute interactive entertainment software and hardware products and provide related services in Germany and the United Kingdom, respectively, and via export in other European countries for a variety of entertainment software publishers, many of which are our competitors, and hardware manufacturers. From time to time, these subsidiaries also maintain exclusive relationships to serve certain retail customers. These services are generally performed subject to limited-term arrangements. Although we expect to use reasonable efforts to retain these vendors and retail customer relationships, we may not be successful in this regard. The cancellation or non-renewal of one or more of these arrangements could negatively impact our business.\nA substantial portion of World of Warcraft's subscribers pay their subscription fees using credit cards. Credit card or other fraud could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows or liquidity.\nA substantial portion of the subscription revenues generated by World of Warcraft is paid by subscribers using credit cards. At times, there may be attempts to use fraudulently obtained credit card numbers to pay for World of Warcraft upgrades or subscriptions. Additionally, the credit card numbers and other sensitive or personally identifiable information of World of Warcraft's subscribers and Battle.net account holders are maintained in a proprietary database that may be subject to malicious intrusion by hackers or otherwise compromised internally or externally. As fraudulent schemes become more sophisticated, it may become more difficult and more costly for us to detect credit card or other fraud and we may be required to incur costs to implement additional security measures to protect subscriber information. An increase in credit card or other fraud could have adverse consequences. In addition, we may be subject to legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, if there is loss, disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our customers' credit card or other sensitive or personally identifiable information.\nData breaches involving the source code for our products or customer, consumer or employee data stored by us, or by a third party operating on our behalf, could negatively impact our business.\nIn the course of our day-to-day business, we and third parties operating on our behalf create, store and/or use commercially sensitive information, such as the source code and game assets for our interactive entertainment software products and confidential information with respect to our customers, consumers and employees. A malicious intrusion by hackers or other breach of the systems on which such source code and assets, account information (including personally identifiable information) and other sensitive data is stored could lead to piracy of our software, fraudulent activity, disclosure or misappropriation of, or access to, our customers', consumers' or employees' personally identifiable information or our own sensitive business data. A data intrusion into a server for a game with online features, such as World of Warcraft games, Call of Duty games or Destiny, or for Battle.net could also disrupt the operation of such game or platform. If we are subject to data security breaches, we may\nhave a loss in sales or subscriptions or be forced to pay damages or incur other costs, including from the implementation of additional security measures, or suffer reputational damage. Moreover, even if there were a public perception that our data protection measures are inadequate, whether or not the case, it could result in reputational damage and potential harm to our business relationships. In addition, we may be subject to legal claims or proceedings in connection with data security breaches, including regulatory investigations and actions.\nWe rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business. Any significant system or network disruption could negatively impact our business.\nWe rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks, some of which are within Activision Blizzard and some of which are managed and/or hosted by third-party providers. All information technology systems and networks are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources, including but not limited to cyber-attacks, malicious software, security breach, energy blackouts, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication failures. We may also face sophisticated attacks, referred to as advanced persistent threats, which are cyber-attacks aimed at compromising our intellectual property and other commercially-sensitive information, such as the source code and game assets for our software or confidential customer or employee information, which remain undetected for prolonged periods of time. Information technology system or network failure or security breach could negatively impact our business continuity, operations and financial results. These risks extend to the networks and e-commerce sites of console platform providers and other partners who sell and host our content online. We may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches.\nIf our migration to new information technology systems does not occur as planned, our business could be negatively impacted.\nWe plan to implement a number of additional significant upgrades in 2015 and beyond to the information technology systems used to operate our core business functions, including the management of our accounting and other financial data. We may experience problems in implementing these upgrades as our employees learn the new system, transfer data from our existing systems to the new systems and operate with the new systems. The transition may not be completed in a timely manner, or at all, requiring us to revert to the currently existing systems. Further, the upgrades may not be implemented properly or otherwise not function as expected. Any difficulties that we encounter in implementing the new systems may disrupt our ability to effectively operate vis-a-vis our employees, vendors, customers, customers and other persons with whom we have commercial relationships. Any such difficulties may also may prevent us from effectively closing a quarterly period and reporting our financial results in a timely manner or have a negative impact in our internal controls over financial reporting. We may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions. Further, if we are unable to produce accurate and timely financial statements, our stock price may be adversely affected and we may be unable to maintain compliance with the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market. In addition, we currently rely on a number of older legacy information technology systems that are relatively difficult to maintain.\nOur results of operations or reputation may be harmed as a result of offensive consumer-created content.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the collaborative online features in our games which allow consumers to post narrative comment, in real time, that is visible to other players. From time to time, objectionable and offensive consumer content may be posted to a gaming or other site with online chat features or game forums which allow consumers to post comments. We may be subject to lawsuits, governmental regulation or restrictions, and consumer backlash (including decreased sales and harmed\nreputation), as a result of consumers posting offensive content. We may also be subject to consumer backlash from comments made in response to postings we make on social media sites such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.\nIf one or more of our titles were found to contain objectionable undisclosed content, our business could suffer.\nThroughout the history of the interactive entertainment industry, many interactive software products have been designed to include certain hidden content and gameplay features that are accessible through the use of in-game codes or other technological means that are intended to enhance the gameplay experience. In some cases, such undisclosed content or features have been considered to be objectionable. In a few cases, the ESRB has reacted to discoveries of such undisclosed content and features by requiring the recall of the game, changing the rating or associated content descriptors originally assigned to the product, requiring the publisher to change the game or game packaging and/or imposing fines on the publisher. Retailers have on occasion reacted to the discovery of such undisclosed content by removing these games from their shelves, refusing to sell them and demanding that their publishers accept them as product returns. Likewise, some interactive entertainment software consumers have reacted to the revelation of undisclosed content by refusing to purchase such games, demanding refunds for games they have already purchased, refraining from buying other games published by the company whose game contained the objectionable material, and, on at least one occasion, filing a lawsuit against the publisher of the product containing such content.\nWe have implemented preventive measures designed to reduce the possibility of objectionable undisclosed content from appearing in the interactive software products we publish. Nonetheless, these preventive measures are subject to human error, circumvention, overriding and reasonable resource constraints. If an interactive software product we publish is found to contain undisclosed content, we could be subject to any of these consequences.\nWe may not be able to adequately adjust our cost structure in a timely fashion in response to a sudden decrease in demand.\nIn the event of a significant decline in demand for one or more of our products, we may not be able to reduce personnel or make other changes to our cost structure without disrupting our operations or incurring costs. Further, we may not be able to implement such actions in a timely manner, if at all, to offset an immediate shortfall in revenues and profit. Moreover, cost-reduction actions may decrease our employee morale and result in the failure to execute upon our business plan due to the loss of employees or impact our ability to retain or recruit key employees. In addition, any such action may involve the risk that our senior management's attention will be excessively diverted from our other operations.\nWe engage in strategic transactions and may encounter difficulties in integrating acquired businesses or otherwise realizing the anticipated benefits of the transactions.\nAs part of our business strategy, from time to time, we acquire, make investments in, or enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures with complementary businesses. These transactions may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including: (A) in the case of an acquisition, (i) the difficulty in integrating the acquired business and operations in an efficient and effective manner, (ii) any liabilities assumed as part of the acquisition, and (iii) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses, and, (B) in the case of an investment, alliance or joint venture, our ability to cooperate with our partner. If any such transaction involves an entity outside of the United States, it may also subject us to the risks and uncertainties of international trade, including the risk that our operations outside the United States could be conducted by our employees, contractors, third-party partners, representatives or agents in ways that violate anti-bribery laws. Further, any such transaction may involve the risk that our senior management's attention will be excessively diverted from our other\noperations, the risk that our industry does not evolve as anticipated and that any intellectual property or personnel skills acquired do not prove to be those needed for our future success, and the risk that our strategic objectives, cost savings or other anticipated benefits are otherwise not achieved.\nOur involvement in joint ventures and other similar arrangements decreases our ability to manage risk.\nWe conduct some of our operations through joint ventures in which we share control with our joint venture partners. Although we enter into joint venture and other similar arrangements in order to share risks with our partners, these arrangements may also decrease our ability to manage risk. As with any joint venture or similar arrangement, differences in views among the participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major issues. There is the risk that our partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours. There is also risk that our partners may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. Failure by us, or an entity in which we have a joint venture or similar interest, to adequately manage the risks associated with any joint ventures or similar arrangements could have a negative impact on our business.\nWe may seek to enter into additional joint ventures or similar arrangements with other entities. We cannot assure that we will undertake such ventures or, if undertaken, that such ventures will be successful or produce the anticipated benefits.\nProvisions in our corporate documents and Delaware state law could delay or prevent a change of control.\nOur Amended and Restated Bylaws contain a provision regulating the ability of shareholders to bring matters for action before annual and special meetings. The regulations on shareholder action could make it more difficult for any person seeking to acquire control of the Company to obtain shareholder approval of actions that would support this effort. In addition, our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of so-called \"blank check\" preferred stock. This ability of our Board of Directors to issue and fix the rights and preferences of preferred stock could effectively dilute the interests of any person seeking control or otherwise make it more difficult to obtain control.\nWe have a number of large shareholders who may sell a large volume of our stock, which could cause our stock price to decrease.\nWe have a number of large shareholders, including ASAC and Vivendi. The sale of a substantial number of shares of common stock by ASAC, Vivendi or any other large shareholder within a short period of time could cause our stock price to decrease, and make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of shares of our common stock.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business.\nOur corporate headquarters and our primary corporate disaster center are located in the Los Angeles, California area and our disaster recovery data center is in Las Vegas, Nevada, each of which is near a major earthquake fault. A major earthquake or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems, or otherwise prevents us from conducting our normal business operations, could require significant expenditures to resume operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows or liquidity. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with such events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Further, our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Any such event could also limit the ability of retailers, distributors or our other customers to sell or distribute our products.\nIf general economic conditions decline, demand for our products could decline.\nOur products involve discretionary spending on the part of consumers. Consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases, including purchases of products like ours, during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail. As a result, our products are sensitive to general economic conditions and economic cycles. A reduction or shift in domestic or international consumer spending could result in an increase in our selling and promotional expenses, in an effort to offset that reduction, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows or liquidity.\nThe uncertainty of worldwide economic conditions makes budgeting and forecasting very difficult.\nWe are unable to predict worldwide economic conditions, and all of the effects those conditions may have on our business. In particular, the uncertainty of future worldwide economic conditions subjects our forecasts to heightened risks and uncertainties.", "PERMNO": 79678, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "ATVI"}
