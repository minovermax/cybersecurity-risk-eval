{"cik": "728249", "company": "INTERPHASE CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe successful commercialization of penveu and ability to generate significant revenue will depend on achieving and maintaining expected levels of market acceptance.\nThe success of penveu is dependent upon achieving and maintaining market acceptance. Commercializing products is time consuming, expensive and unpredictable. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully commercialize or gain market acceptance for penveu. New product candidates that appear promising in development may have only limited or no commercial success. Our efforts to educate customers on the benefits of penveu may require significant resources and may never be successful. The degree of market acceptance of penveu will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\npricing and cost-effectiveness relative to competing products;\n\u25cf\nbudgetary availability for target customers;\n\u25cf\nrelative convenience and ease of use;\n\u25cf\nflexibility, accuracy and other potential advantages over alternatives;\n\u25cf\nwillingness of target markets to try new products; and\n\u25cf\nstrength of marketing strategies and sales efforts.\nIf penveu does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue and we may not become profitable.\nThe continued issues in global credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe global credit and financial markets have been experiencing significant disruptions for several years, including diminished liquidity and credit availability. There can be no assurance that there will not be continuing, or even further, deterioration in credit and financial markets. These economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. The continued tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers, distributors, or customers could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges.\nWe are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current and potential future disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions. There can be no assurance that if the current uncertain economic conditions continue, it will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe marketing and sale of our products involve lengthy sales cycles. This and other factors make business forecasting extremely difficult and can lead to significant fluctuations in period-to-period results.\nWe have experienced fluctuations in our period-to-period revenue and operating results in the past and may experience similar fluctuations in the future. Our sales, on both an annual and a quarterly basis, can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. We may have difficulty predicting the volume and timing of orders for products, and delays in closing orders can cause our operating results to fall short of anticipated levels for any period.\nDelays by our OEM customers in producing products that incorporate our products could also cause operating results to fall short of anticipated levels. Other factors that may particularly contribute to fluctuations in our revenue and operating results include success in achieving design wins, the market acceptance of the OEM products that incorporate our products, the rate of adoption of new products, competition from new technologies and other companies, and the variability of the life cycles of our customers\u2019 products.\nIn addition, as we target more of our sales efforts at the education market, we may face lengthy sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. Because we are new to this market segment, we may spend a considerable amount of time and expense providing information to prospective customers about the use and benefits of penveu without generating corresponding revenue. Likewise, educational institutions may require long testing and approval processes before making a decision to purchase penveu. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support to individual schools, driving up costs and time required to complete sales. Also, our sales cycles are subject to delays as a result of customer-specific factors over which we have little or no control, including budgetary constraints and internal approval procedures.\nBecause fluctuations can happen, we believe that comparisons of the results of our operations for preceding quarters are not necessarily predictive of future quarters and that investors should not rely on the results of any one quarter as an indication of how we will perform in the future. Investors should also understand that, if the revenue or operating results for any quarter are less than the level expected by securities analysts or the market in general, the market price of our common stock could immediately and significantly decline.\nThe communications networking and signaling business is characterized by rapid technological change and frequent introduction of new products.\nThe market for our communications networking products is characterized by rapid technological change and the frequent introduction of products based on new technologies. The overall communications networking industry is volatile, as the effects of new technologies, new standards, new products and short life cycles contribute to changes in the industry and the performance of industry participants. In addition, the market for our communications networking products has declined as native IP-based networks continue to proliferate, so that our products in this area are likely to remain viable in networks only in shrinking numbers. Future revenue will depend upon our ability to anticipate technological change and to develop and introduce enhanced products of our own on a timely basis that comply with new industry standards. New product introductions, or the delays thereof, could contribute to quarterly fluctuations in operating results as orders for new products commence and orders for existing products decline. Moreover, significant delays can occur between a product introduction and commencement of volume production. A typical time period from design-win of one of our communications networking products to actual production is 18 to 30 months. This timing has varied significantly during times of mergers, economic instability, and technology changes affecting platform architectures. Our inability to develop and manufacture new products in a timely manner, the existence of reliability, quality or availability problems in our products or their component parts, or the failure to achieve market acceptance for our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to successfully manage new product and service introductions and the entry into new markets.\nAs described under Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Business Strategy\u201d above, we are focused upon a strategy to expand our reach into innovative and sometimes market-disruptive technologies and services where we believe we have the technology and process excellence to be successful. As a result we intend to introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. We expect that these new product and service introductions will lead us into markets where we have not previously competed. The success of new product and service introductions will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful development of products or services, market acceptance, our ability to manage the risks associated with new products and production ramp issues, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand, the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction, and the availability of qualified persons to perform new services. Accordingly, we cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect that new product and service introductions and the entry into new markets will have on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur direct marketing and sale of penveu may adversely affect the performance of manufacturer representatives, consultants and other resellers selling penveu, and our investments in reseller programs may not be effective.\nWe advertise and sell penveu through manufacturer representatives, consultants and value-added resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. We also sell penveu directly to education and enterprise customers and through our online store.\nMany resellers have narrow operating margins. Some resellers could perceive our direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of penveu. Such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of penveu or could lead them to limit or cease distribution of penveu. We have invested and may continue to invest in programs designed to enhance reseller sales. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing penveu, or uncertainty regarding demand for penveu could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of penveu.\nLitigation against us could require significant time of our management, be costly to defend against and/or negatively impact our operating results.\nAs noted under Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d below, twenty-five former employees (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) of Interphase SAS, a France domiciled subsidiary of Interphase Corporation, brought suit in France against Interphase SAS alleging various causes of action and rights to damages relating to claims of wrongful dismissal of employment, specific French employment indemnities, general economic losses, and contractual claims relating specifically to their employment relationship and contracts entered into between the individual and Interphase SAS. The lawsuits were filed between November 2010 and April 2011 in the Labor Court of Boulogne-Billancourt, France and the Administrative Court of Cergy-Pontoise, France. The various claims and assertions arose from, and related to, the Plaintiffs\u2019 release from employment as part of the restructuring actions taken during the third quarter of 2010.\nWe have been successful in defending most, though not all, of these claims in the two courts. To date, the Labor Court has entered an adverse judgment as to claims totaling approximately \u20ac265,000, which translated to approximately $340,000 at March 31, 2013 when accrued. All payments related to these claims, excluding payroll taxes, have been paid. In addition, two of the claims remain pending in the courts. The current statement of claim, for the remaining two former employees, is for an aggregate payment of approximately \u20ac144,000 (which translated to approximately $175,000 at December 31, 2014). We believe that the Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims are without merit and plan to continue to vigorously defend ourselves against them.\nAlthough we do not believe that the Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims have merit, litigation (particularly outside of the United States) is inherently unpredictable, and it is possible that we would be required to pay an additional amount to the Plaintiffs. If the potential required amount is significant, the payment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Further, if this litigation were to continue for an extended time, our defense of the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, even if successful, could require us to pay significant costs (including fees of counsel) and require time and energy of management that could otherwise be spent on our business, all of which could negatively affect our financial condition and operations.\nWe may be subject to greater than anticipated tax liabilities, and the results of tax audits or litigation could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and France. Therefore, we regularly assess the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant discretion, and we could face significant adverse impact if our assumptions are incorrect and/or face significant costs to defend our practices from international and United States tax authorities. We are periodically subject to audits by tax authorities in the United States and France and are currently undergoing a tax audit in France for prior tax years. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, and we may defend our positions through litigation if necessary, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation is inherently uncertain. As a result, the ultimate outcome from any audit could be materially different from amounts reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. Moreover, we could be subject to assessments of substantial additional taxes, fines and penalties relating to ongoing or future audits. The adverse resolution of any audits or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe operate in an intensely competitive marketplace and many of our competitors have greater resources than we do.\nWe face competition from a number of established and emerging companies, both public and private, in the markets we serve. Our principal competitors for our communications networking products and penveu generally have established brand name recognition and market positions, and have substantially greater financial resources to deploy on promotion, advertising, research and product development. In addition, as we broaden our product and service offerings, we may face competition from new competitors. Companies in related markets could offer products with functionality similar or superior to our product offerings. Increased competition could result in significant pricing pressures, which could result in significantly lower average selling prices for our products and services. We may not be able to offset the effects of any price reductions with an increase in sales volumes, cost reductions or otherwise. We expect competition to increase as a result of industry consolidations and alliances, as well as the potential emergence of new competitors. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe loss of one or more key customers, or reduced spending by customers, could significantly impact our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWhile we enjoy very good relationships with our customers, there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to purchase products from us at the current levels. Orders from our customers are affected by factors such as new product introductions, product life cycles, inventory levels, manufacturing strategies, contract awards, competitive conditions and general economic conditions. In addition, the market for our communications networking products has declined as native IP-based networks continue to proliferate. Customers typically do not enter into long-term volume purchase contracts with us, and they have certain rights to extend or delay the shipment of their orders. The loss of one or more of our major customers, or the reduction, delay or cancellation of orders or a delay in shipment of products to such customers, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nSchedule delays, cancellations of programs and changes in customer markets can delay or prevent a design-win from reaching the production phase, which could negatively impact our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn the communications networking industry, a design-win occurs when a customer or prospective customer notifies us that our product has been selected to be integrated with their product. Ordinarily, there are a number of steps between the design-win and when customers initiate production shipments. Design-wins reach production volumes at varying rates, typically beginning approximately 18 to 30 months after the design-win occurs. A variety of risks, such as schedule delays, customer consolidations, cancellations of programs and changes in customer markets, can delay or prevent the design-win from reaching the production phase. The customer's failure to bring its product (into which our product is designed) to the production phase could have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nDesign defects, errors or problems in our products or services could harm our reputation, revenue and profitability.\nIf we deliver products or services with errors, defects or problems, our credibility, market acceptance and sales of our products and services could be harmed. Further, if our products or services contain errors, defects or problems, we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to alleviate such problems. Defects could also lead to product liability lawsuits against us or our customers, tort or warranty claims, increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs, any of which could harm our business. We have agreed to indemnify our customers in some circumstances against liability from defects in our products. While no such litigation currently exists, product liability litigation arising from errors, defects or problems, even if it resulted in an outcome favorable to us, would be time consuming and costly to defend. Existing or future laws, or unfavorable judicial decisions, could negate any limitation-of-liability provisions that are included in our license agreements. A product liability claim, whether or not successful, could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe maintain insurance coverage for product liability claims. Although we believe this coverage is adequate, there can be no assurance that coverage under insurance policies will be adequate to cover specific product liability claims made against us. In addition, product liability insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The amount and scope of any insurance coverage may be inadequate if a product liability claim is successfully asserted against us.\nIf our third party suppliers fail to produce quality products or parts in a timely manner, we may not be able to meet our customers\u2019 demands.\nCertain components used in our products are currently available from one or only a limited number of sources. There can be no assurance that future supplies will be adequate for our needs or will be available with acceptable prices and terms. Inability in the future to obtain sufficient limited-source components, or to develop alternative sources, could result in delays in product introduction or shipments, and increased component prices could negatively affect gross margins, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals (gold, tin, tungsten and tantalum), known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries that are believed to be benefitting armed groups. As a result, the SEC has adopted due diligence, disclosure and reporting requirements for companies which manufacture products that include components containing such minerals. Since we manufacture products which may use one or more of such minerals, we are required to comply with the new SEC rules. We must prepare and file a report in May of each year covering our activities in the preceding year. We have spent, and expect to continue to spend, money and time of key personnel to comply with these disclosure requirements, including diligence to determine the sources of minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. Compliance with the SEC rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. Because there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. In addition, our supply chain is complex and we have not been able to easily verify the origins for all minerals used in our products. We may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we continue to be unable to sufficiently verify the origins of minerals contained in the components included in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implemented.\nAlthough we expect to be able to continue to comply with the reporting requirements, our ability to do so depends on the continuous enhancement of our processes and procedures and on information supplied by numerous suppliers of products or components to us that contain, or potentially contain, conflict minerals. To the extent that the information that we receive from our suppliers is inadequate or inaccurate, or our procedures to obtain the information do not fulfill the SEC\u2019s requirements, we could face both reputational and SEC-enforcement risks.\nWe are dependent on one manufacturing facility, and if there is an interruption in production we may not be able to deliver products on a timely basis.\nWe manufacture our products at our Carrollton, Texas facility, and are taking steps to renew a contract for alternative manufacturing capabilities through a third party in the event of a disaster in the current facility. Even if we are successful in establishing an alternative third-party contract manufacturer, there can be no assurance that we would be able to retain its services at the same costs we currently enjoy. In the event of an interruption in production, we may not be able to deliver products on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results. Although we currently have business interruption insurance and a disaster recovery plan to mitigate the effect of an interruption, no assurances can be given that such insurance or recovery plan will adequately cover lost business as a result of such an interruption.\nBecause business forecasting is difficult and involves uncertainty, we may fail to accurately forecast demand for our products which may expose us to risk associated with inventory.\nWe must identify the right product mix and maintain sufficient raw materials inventory on hand to meet customer orders. Failure to do so could adversely affect our sales and earnings. However, if circumstances change, there could be a material impact on the net realizable value of our inventory, which could adversely affect our results.\nWe may be unable to effectively protect our proprietary technology, which would negatively affect our ability to compete. Also, if our products are alleged to violate the proprietary rights of others, our ability to compete would be negatively impacted.\nOur success depends partly upon certain proprietary technologies developed within our products. Historically, we have relied principally upon trademark, copyright and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technologies. Over the last few years, we also filed a number of patents and trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and internationally. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our customers, distributors and potential customers, which limit access to, and distribution of, the source code to our software and other proprietary information. Our employees are subject to our strict employment policy regarding confidentiality. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by us in this regard will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technologies or to provide an effective remedy in the event of a misappropriation by others.\nAlthough we believe our products do not infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties, there can be no assurance that infringement claims will not be asserted, possibly resulting in costly litigation in which we may not ultimately prevail. Adverse determinations in such litigation could result in the loss of proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities, require that we seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nIt may be necessary to obtain technology licenses from others due to the large number of patents in the markets we serve and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents and new standards or to obtain important new technology. There can be no assurance that these third party technology licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms. The loss of, or inability to, obtain any of these technology licenses could result in delays or reductions in product shipments. Such delays or reductions in product shipments could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.\nWe may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions. These may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, communication networking failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could prevent access to our online store and services, compromise our data, or result in delayed or cancelled orders. System failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, delivery of online services, transactions processing and financial reporting.\nWe depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively.\nOur success and the pursuit of our business strategy depend on the continued contributions of our personnel and on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees for our current and future business. Changes in personnel could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from outside of North America, which exposes us to additional business risks, including political, economic and currency risks.\nIn 2014, we derived approximately 44% of our revenues from sales outside of North America. Economic and political conditions in some of these markets, as well as different legal, tax, accounting and other regulatory requirements, may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. We are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates because we conduct business on a global basis and in some cases in foreign currencies. Our former operations in France were transacted in the local currency and converted into U.S. Dollars based on published exchange rates for the periods reported and were therefore subject to risk of exchange rate fluctuations (See Item 7A. \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk - Foreign Currency Risk\u201d below).\nWe may require additional working capital to fund operations and expand our business.\nWe believe our current financial resources will be sufficient to meet our present working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. However, we may need to raise additional capital before this period ends to:\n\u25cf\nfund research and development of new products beyond what is expected in 2015;\n\u25cf\nexpand product and service offerings beyond what is contemplated in 2015 if unforeseen opportunities arise;\n\u25cf\nfund activities related to the introduction of new products and services or the entry into new markets beyond what is anticipated in 2015;\n\u25cf\nrespond to a rapid or unanticipated increase in demand for our products;\n\u25cf\ntake advantage of potential acquisition opportunities in the current economic environment;\n\u25cf\ninvest in businesses and technologies that complement our current operations;\n\u25cf\nrespond to unforeseen competitive pressures; or\n\u25cf\nmanage other unforeseen operating expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors.\nOur future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including the success of the existing and new product and service offerings and potentially competing technological and market developments. However, any projections of future cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. From time to time, we expect to evaluate the acquisition of, or investment in, businesses and technologies that complement our current operations. If current cash, marketable securities, lines of credit and cash generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity securities, issue debt securities or increase or restructure our line of credit. The sale of additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to shareholders. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to develop or enhance products and services, take advantage of future opportunities, successfully operate the business or respond to competitive pressures would be limited. This limitation could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to maintain effectiveness of the resale registration statement for a recent private investor, which could obligate us to make certain payments or impact the liquidity of our common stock.\nAs required by the registration rights agreement that we entered into on August 13, 2014 with a single investor, the purchaser of 1,367,000 shares of our common stock from us in a private placement, we have filed and maintained a registration statement with SEC under the Securities Act to permit the purchaser (the \u201cSelling Shareholder\u201d) to publicly resell those shares from time to time. In the registration rights agreement, we agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the continuous effectiveness of the registration statement, but there is a risk we will not be able to do so. We cannot assure that we will not be required to suspend or cease sales under the registration statement, that the SEC will not issue any stop order to suspend the effectiveness of the registration statement or that, if such a stop order is issued, we will be able to amend the registration statement to respond to the stop order to permit sales to be made under the registration statement. Under the registration rights agreement, if the effectiveness of the registration statement is suspended for certain specified time periods, then, subject to certain exceptions, we may be obligated to pay certain liquidated damages to the Selling Shareholder. Also, to the extent the registration statement is not effective, the Selling Shareholder\u2019s ability to sell the shares of common stock may be limited, which could (depending on the extent of the Selling Shareholder\u2019s selling activity) have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock.\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public markets or significant short sales of our common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity-related securities in the public markets, could depress the market price of our common stock. If there are significant short sales of our stock, the price decline that could result from this activity may cause the share price to decline more so, which, in turn, may cause long holders of the common stock to sell their shares, thereby contributing to sales of common stock in the market. Such sales also may impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional shares in the future at a time and price that our management deems acceptable, if at all.\nWe have incurred significant losses, which may result in volatility in our stock price.\nWe reported net losses of $5.2 million, $2.7 million and $3.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. In order to achieve consistent profitability, we will need to generate higher revenues while containing costs and operating expenses. We cannot be certain that our revenues will grow or that we will generate sufficient revenues to achieve and maintain profitability on a long-term, sustained basis. If we fail to achieve and maintain profitability, the market price of our common stock will likely be negatively impacted.\nWe may experience significant period-to-period quarterly and annual fluctuations in our revenue and operating results, which may result in volatility in our stock price.\nThe trading price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in operating results, general conditions in the communications networking industry and other events or factors. In addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility in recent years. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the market price of the securities of many high-technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, which has historically had relatively small trading volumes. As a result, small transactions in our common stock can have a disproportionately large impact on its price.\nIf our stock does not continue to be traded on an established exchange, an active trading market may not exist and the trading price of our stock may decline.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. The NASDAQ Capital Market\u2019s continued listing standards for our common stock require, among other things, that (i) the closing bid price for our common stock not fall below $1.00; (ii) we have at least 300 beneficial holders and/or holders of record of our common stock; (iii) our stockholders\u2019 equity not fall below $2.5 million; (iv) we have more than 500,000 shares held by the public (excluding officers, directors, and beneficial holders of 10% or more) with a market value of at least $1.0 million; and (v) we have at least two registered and active dealers meeting the requirements set forth in the standards. If our common stock was threatened with delisting from the NASDAQ Capital Market, we may, depending on the circumstances, seek to extend the period for regaining compliance with NASDAQ listing requirements or we may pursue other strategic alternatives to meet the continuing listing standards.\nIn addition, we may choose to voluntarily delist from NASDAQ, or even deregister from the reporting requirements with the SEC (i.e., \u201cgo dark\u201d), in the event we believe we may be subject to a delisting proceeding, or for any other reason our Board of Directors determines it to be in the best interest of our stockholders.\nIf our common stock is delisted by, or we voluntarily delist from, the NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock may be eligible to be traded on the OTC Bulletin Board or the Pink OTC Markets. In such an event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations for the price of, our common stock, and there also would likely be a reduction in our coverage by security analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further.\nCertain provisions of Texas law may make it more difficult to acquire us, even if such acquisition might be beneficial to our shareholders.\nCertain provisions of the Texas corporate statute, to which we are subject, limits business combinations with any \u201caffiliated shareholder,\u201d which is generally any person or group of persons that is, or has been during the preceding three years, the beneficial owner of 20% or more of our outstanding voting shares. The statutory provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us or acquiring a large portion of our shares (including by initiating a tender offer), even if our shareholders might receive for their shares in any such acquisition a premium over the then current market price of the shares.\nThe cost of compliance or failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 may adversely affect our business.\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not subject to the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that require an attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding our internal controls over financial reporting. If we cease to qualify as a smaller reporting company or as a non-accelerated filer, we would become subject to this requirement, which could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and may adversely affect our financial results. The failure of our independent registered public accounting firm to concur with management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting may result in investors losing confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock. It may also prevent us from providing the required financial information in a timely manner which could materially and adversely impact our business, our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock, and it may prevent us from otherwise complying with the standards applicable to us as a public company and subject us to additional regulatory consequences.", "PERMNO": 45560, "SIC": 3576, "TIC": "INPHQ"}
