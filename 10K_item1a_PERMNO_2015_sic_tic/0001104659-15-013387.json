{"cik": "103145", "company": "VEECO INSTRUMENTS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisk Factors That May Impact Future Results\nCurrent and potential stockholders should consider carefully the risk factors described below. Any of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, and stock price.\nUnfavorable market conditions may adversely affect our operating results.\nConditions of the markets in which we operate are volatile and, in the past, have deteriorated significantly in many of the countries and regions in which we do business and may become depressed again in the future. Foreign government incentives designed to encourage the development of the LED industry have been unpredictable, and the availability of the incentives can impact the demand for our MOCVD products. We have experienced and may continue to experience customer rescheduling and, to a lesser extent, cancellations of orders for our products. Adverse market conditions relative to our products would negatively impact our business, and could result in:\n\u00b7 reduced demand for our products;\n\u00b7 rescheduling and cancellations of orders for our products, resulting in negative backlog adjustments;\n\u00b7 increased price competition and lower margin for our products;\n\u00b7 increased competition from sellers of used equipment or lower-priced alternatives to our products;\n\u00b7 increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;\n\u00b7 increased risk in the collectability of amounts due from our customers;\n\u00b7 increased risk in potential reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable;\n\u00b7 disruptions in our supply chain as we reduce our purchasing volumes and limit our contract manufacturing operations; and\n\u00b7 higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues.\nIf the markets in which we participate fail to experience a recovery or experience a further downturn, this could have a further negative impact on our sales and revenue generation, margins and operating expenses, and profitability.\nA reduction or elimination of foreign government subsidies and economic incentives may adversely affect the future order rate for our MOCVD equipment.\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenue in China. In recent years, the Chinese government has provided various incentives to encourage development of the LED industry, including subsidizing a significant portion of the purchase cost of MOCVD equipment. These subsidies have enabled and encouraged certain customers in this region to purchase more of our MOCVD equipment than these customers might have purchased without these subsidies. The availability of these subsidies has varied over time and may end at some point in the future. A reduction or elimination of these incentives may result in a reduction in future orders for our MOCVD equipment in this region, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA related risk is that many customers use or had planned to use Chinese government subsidies, in addition to other incentives from the Chinese government, to build new manufacturing facilities or to expand existing manufacturing facilities. Delays in the start-up of these facilities or the cancellation of construction plans altogether, together with other related issues pertaining to customer readiness, could adversely impact the timing of our revenue recognition, could result in order cancellations, and could have other negative effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nThe cyclicality of the industries we serve directly affects our business.\nOur business depends in large part upon the capital expenditures of manufacturers in the LED markets, data storage markets, and other device markets. We are subject to the business cycles of these industries, the timing, length, and volatility of which are difficult to predict. These industries have historically been highly cyclical and have experienced significant economic downturns in the last decade. As a capital equipment provider, our revenue depends in large part on the spending patterns of these customers, who often delay expenditures or cancel or reschedule orders in reaction to variations in their businesses or general economic conditions. In downturns, we must be able to quickly and effectively align our costs with prevailing market conditions, as well as motivate and retain key employees. However, because a portion of our costs are fixed, our ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to revenue shortfalls may be limited. Downturns in one or more of these industries have had and will likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Alternatively, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to acquire and/or develop sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand, and attract, hire, assimilate, and retain a sufficient number of qualified people. We cannot give assurances that our net sales and operating results will not be adversely affected if our customers experience economic downturns or slowdowns in their businesses.\nWe operate in industries characterized by rapid technological change.\nEach of the industries in which we operate are subject to rapid technological change. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our ability to enhance existing products and develop and manufacture new products in a timely and cost effective manner and to accurately predict technology transitions. Because new product development commitments must be made well in advance of sales, we must anticipate the future demand for products in selecting which development programs to fund and pursue. Our financial results for the current year and in the future will depend to a great extent on the successful introduction of several new products, many of which require achieving increasingly stringent technical specifications. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in selecting, developing, manufacturing, and marketing new products or new technologies or in enhancing existing products.\nWe depend on a limited number of customers, located primarily in a limited number of regions, which operate in highly concentrated industries.\nOur customer base continues to be highly concentrated. Orders from a relatively limited number of customers have accounted for, and likely will continue to account for, a substantial portion of our net sales, which may lead customers to demand pricing and other terms less favorable to us. Our five largest customers accounted for 46% of our total net sales in 2014. Customer consolidation activity involving some of our largest customers could result in an even greater concentration of our sales in the future.\nIf a principal customer discontinues its relationship with us or suffers economic setbacks, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Our ability to increase sales in the future will depend in part upon our ability to obtain orders from new customers. We cannot be certain that we will be able to do so. In addition, because a relatively small number of large manufacturers, many of whom are our customers, dominate the industries in\nwhich they operate, it may be especially difficult for us to replace these customers if we lose their business. A substantial portion of orders in our backlog are orders from our principal customers.\nIn addition, a substantial investment is required by customers to install and integrate capital equipment into a production line. As a result, once a manufacturer has selected a particular vendor\u2019s capital equipment, we believe that the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for the specific production line application and frequently will attempt to consolidate its other capital equipment requirements with the same vendor. Accordingly, if a customer selects a competitor\u2019s product over ours, we could experience difficulty selling to that customer for a significant period of time.\nFurthermore, we do not have long-term contracts with our customers. As a result, our agreements with our customers do not provide any assurance of future sales, and we are exposed to competitive price pressure on each new order we attempt to obtain. Our failure to obtain new sales orders from new or existing customers would have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nOur customer base is also highly concentrated in terms of geography, and the majority of our sales are to customers located in a limited number of countries. In 2014, 62% of our total net sales were to customers located in China, Taiwan and South Korea. Dependence upon sales emanating from a limited number of regions increases our risk of exposure to local difficulties and challenges, such as those associated with regional economic downturns, political instability, fluctuating currency exchange rates, natural disasters, social unrest, pandemics, terrorism, or acts of war. In addition, we may encounter challenges associated with political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations, and policies within these countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors. Our reliance upon customer demand arising primarily from a limited number of countries could materially adversely impact our future results of operations.\nWe face significant competition.\nWe face significant competition throughout the world, which may increase as certain markets in which we operate continue to expand. Some of our competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing, and marketing resources than us. In addition, we face competition from smaller emerging equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services we offer, with a focused approach on innovative technology for specialized markets. New product introductions or enhancements by us or our competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our existing or prior generation products. Increased competitive pressure could also lead to intensified price competition resulting in lower margins. Our failure to compete successfully with these other companies would seriously harm our business.\nThe timing of our orders, shipments, and revenue recognition may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our net sales in any fiscal period from the sale of a relatively small number of high-priced systems. As a result, the timing of recognition of revenue for a single transaction could have a material effect on our sales and operating results for a particular fiscal period. As is typical in our industry, orders, shipments, and customer acceptances often occur during the last few weeks of a quarter. As a result, delay of only a week or two will determine which period revenue is reported in and can cause volatility in our revenue for a given reporting period. Our quarterly results have fluctuated significantly in the past, and we expect this trend to continue. If our orders, shipments, net sales, or operating results in a particular quarter do not meet expectations, our stock price may be adversely affected.\nOur sales cycle is long and unpredictable.\nHistorically, we have experienced long and unpredictable sales cycles (the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the time when we recognize revenue from that customer). Our sales cycle can exceed twelve months. The timing of an order often depends on the capital expenditure budget cycle of our customers, which is completely out of our control. In addition, the time it takes us to build a product to customer specifications typically ranges from three to six months. When coupled with the fluctuating amount of time required for shipment, installation, and final acceptance, our sales cycles often vary widely, and variations in length of this period can cause further fluctuations in our operating results. As a result of our lengthy sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development expenses and selling, general, and administrative expenses before we generate revenues for these products. We may never generate the anticipated revenues if a customer cancels or changes plans. Variations in the length of our sales cycle could also cause our sales and, therefore, our cash flow and results of operation to fluctuate widely from period to period.\nOur backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification and such cancellation could result in decreased sales and increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and/or liabilities to our suppliers for products no longer needed.\nCustomer purchase orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer, sometimes with limited or no penalties. Often, we have incurred expenses prior to such cancellation without adequate monetary compensation. We adjust our backlog for such cancellations, contract modifications, and delivery delays that result in a delivery period in excess of one year, among other items. A downturn in MOCVD could result in increases in order cancellations and/or postponements.\nWe record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and future usage trends and other factors including the consideration of the amount of backlog we have on hand at any particular point in time. If our backlog is canceled or modified, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we will be required to recognize such costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination. In addition, we place orders with our suppliers based on our customers\u2019 orders to us. If our customers cancel their orders with us, we may not be able to cancel our orders with our suppliers and may be required to take a charge for these cancelled commitments to our suppliers. Any such charges could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory and/or liabilities to our suppliers for products no longer needed, while manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect our ability to meet customer demand.\nOur business depends on our ability to accurately forecast and supply equipment, services, and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of our customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, components, and subassemblies (collectively, \u201cparts\u201d) from suppliers. Uncertain worldwide economic conditions and market instabilities make it difficult for us (and our customers and our suppliers) to accurately forecast future product demand. If actual demand for our products is different than expected, we may purchase more/fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing, or expediting delivery of parts. If we overestimate the demand for our products, excess inventory could result, which could be subject to heavy price discounting, which could become obsolete, and which could subject us to liabilities to our suppliers for products no longer needed. Similarly, we may be harmed in the event that our competitors overestimate the demand for their products and engage in heavy price discounting practices as a result. In addition, the volatility of demand for capital equipment increases capital, technical, and other risks for companies in the supply chain.\nFurthermore, some key parts may be subject to long lead-times and/or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the United States. We may experience significant interruptions of our manufacturing operations, delays in our ability to deliver products or services, increased costs, or customer order cancellations as a result of:\n\u00b7 the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver quality parts;\n\u00b7 volatility in the availability and cost of materials;\n\u00b7 difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;\n\u00b7 information technology or infrastructure failures;\n\u00b7 natural disasters (such as earthquakes, tsunamis, floods or storms); or\n\u00b7 other causes (such as regional economic downturns, pandemics, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war) that could result in delayed deliveries, manufacturing inefficiencies, increased costs, or order cancellations.\nIn addition, in the event of an unanticipated increase in demand for our products, our need to rapidly increase our business and manufacturing capacity may be limited by working capital constraints of our suppliers and may exacerbate any interruptions in our manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on our working capital. Any or all of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur failure to successfully manage our outsourcing activities or failure of our outsourcing partners to perform as anticipated could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to adapt to fluctuating order volumes.\nTo better align our costs with market conditions, increase the percentage of variable costs relative to total costs, and to increase productivity and operational efficiency, we have outsourced certain functions to third parties, including the manufacture of all or substantially all of our MOCVD systems, ion beam and other data storage systems, and ion sources. We are relying heavily on our outsourcing partners to perform their contracted functions and to allow us the flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions, including periods of significantly diminished order volumes. If our outsourcing partners do not perform as required, or if our outsourcing model does not allow us to realize the intended cost savings and flexibility, our results of operations (and those of our third party providers) may be adversely affected. Disputes and possibly litigation involving third party providers could result, and we could suffer damage to our reputation. Dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing may also adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market. Although we attempt to select reputable providers, it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect. In addition, the role of third party providers has required and will continue to require us to implement changes to our existing operations and adopt new procedures and processes for retaining and managing these providers in order to realize operational efficiencies, assure quality, and protect our intellectual property. If we do not effectively manage our outsourcing strategy or if third party providers do not perform as anticipated, we may not realize the benefits of productivity improvements, and we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs, manufacturing and/or installation interruptions or delays, inefficiencies in the structure and/or operation of our supply chain, loss of intellectual property rights, quality issues, increased product time-to-market and/or inefficient allocation of human resources, any or all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers, some of whom are our sole source for particular components.\nWe currently outsource certain functions to third parties, including the manufacture of all or substantially all of our MOCVD systems, ion beam and other data storage systems, and ion sources. We primarily rely on several suppliers for the manufacturing of these systems. We plan to maintain some level of internal manufacturing capability for these systems. The failure of our suppliers to meet their contractual obligations under our supply arrangements and our inability to make alternative arrangements or resume the manufacture of these systems ourselves could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with our customers and/or our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nIn addition, certain of the components and sub-assemblies included in our products are obtained from a single source or a limited group of suppliers. Our inability to develop alternative sources, if necessary, could result in a prolonged interruption in supply or a significant increase in the price of one or more components, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nOur inability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success depends upon our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees, including those in executive, managerial, engineering, and marketing positions, as well as highly skilled and qualified technical personnel and personnel to implement and monitor our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems. Attracting, retaining, and motivating such qualified personnel may be difficult due to challenging industry conditions, competition for such personnel by other technology companies, consolidations and relocations of operations, and workforce reductions. While we have entered into employment agreements with certain key personnel, our inability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nOur acquisition strategy subjects us to risks associated with evaluating and pursuing these opportunities and integrating these businesses.\nWe have considered numerous acquisition opportunities and completed several significant acquisitions in the past. We may consider acquisitions of, or investments in, other businesses in the future. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, many of which are unpredictable and beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7 difficulties and increased costs in integrating the personnel, operations, technologies, and products of acquired companies;\n\u00b7 diversion of management\u2019s attention while evaluating, pursuing, and integrating the business to be acquired;\n\u00b7 potential loss of key employees of acquired companies, especially if a relocation or change in responsibilities is involved;\n\u00b7 difficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations in a cost-effective manner;\n\u00b7 lack of synergy or inability to realize expected synergies;\n\u00b7 unknown, underestimated, and/or undisclosed commitments or liabilities;\n\u00b7 increased amortization expense relating to intangible assets; and\n\u00b7 other adverse effects on our business, including the potential impairment and write-down of amounts capitalized as intangible assets and goodwill as part of the acquisition, as a result of technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance by the acquired company.\nOur inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operation. We are subject to many of these risks in connection with our recent acquisitions of Synos Technology, Inc. and Solid State Equipment LLC. Refer to Note 5, \u201cBusiness Combinations,\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on these recent acquisitions.\nIn addition, if we issue equity securities to pay for an acquisition, the ownership percentage of our then-existing shareholders would be reduced and the value of the shares held by these shareholders could be diluted, which could adversely affect the price of our stock. If we use cash to pay for an acquisition, the payment could significantly reduce the cash that would be available to fund our operations or other purposes.\nTiming of market adoption of LED technology for general lighting is uncertain.\nOur future business prospects depend largely on the market adoption of products that incorporate our technologies. Potential barriers to such adoption include higher initial costs and customer familiarity with, and substantial investment and know-how in, existing technologies. These barriers apply to the adoption of LED technology for general illumination applications, including residential, commercial, and street lighting markets. While the use of LED technology for general lighting has grown in recent years, challenges remain and widespread adoption may not occur at currently projected rates. Furthermore, the adoption of, or changes in, government policies that discourage the use of traditional lighting technologies may impact LED adoption.\nOur sales to LED, data storage and other manufacturers are highly dependent on these manufacturers\u2019 sales for consumer electronics applications, which can experience significant volatility due to seasonal and other factors, which could materially adversely impact our future results of operations.\nThe demand for LEDs, hard disk drives, and other Company products is highly dependent on sales of consumer electronics, such as flat-panel televisions and computer monitors, computers, tablets, digital video recorders, camcorders, MP3/4 players, smartphones, cell phones, and other mobile devices. Manufacturers of LEDs and hard disk drives are among our largest customers and have accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues for the past several years. Factors that could influence the levels of spending on consumer electronic products include consumer confidence, access to credit, volatility in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets, labor and healthcare costs, and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. These and other economic factors have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on the demand for our customers\u2019 products and, in turn, on our customers\u2019 demand for our products and services and on our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, manufacturers of LEDs have in the past overestimated their potential market share growth. If this growth is currently overestimated or is overestimated in the future, we may experience further cancellations of orders in backlog, rescheduling of customer deliveries, obsolete inventory and/or liabilities to our suppliers for products no longer needed.\nIn addition, the demand for some of our customers\u2019 products can be even more volatile and unpredictable due to the possibility of competing technologies, such as flash memory as an alternative to hard disk drives. Unpredictable fluctuations in demand for our customers\u2019 products or rapid shifts in demand from our customers\u2019 products to alternative technologies could materially adversely impact our future results of operations.\nOur operating results have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by tightening credit markets.\nAs a global company with worldwide operations, we are subject to volatility and adverse consequences associated with worldwide economic downturns. In the event of a worldwide downturn, many of our customers may delay or further reduce their purchases of our products and services. If negative conditions in the global credit markets prevent our customers from obtaining credit, product orders in these channels may decrease, which could result in lower revenue. In addition, we may\nexperience cancellations of orders in backlog, rescheduling of customer deliveries, and attendant pricing pressures. If our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit, in selling their products, or otherwise in operating their businesses, they may become unable to continue to offer the materials we use to manufacture our products which could impair our operations.\nFurthermore, tightening macroeconomic measures and monetary policies adopted by China\u2019s government aimed at preventing overheating of China\u2019s economy and controlling China\u2019s high level of inflation have limited, and may continue to limit, the availability of financing to our customers in this region. Limited financing, or delays in the timing of such financing, may result in delays and cancellations of shipments of our products (and associated revenues) conditioned on such financing.\nIn addition, we finance a portion of our sales through trade credit. In addition to ongoing credit evaluations of our customers\u2019 financial condition, we seek to mitigate our credit risk by obtaining deposits and/or letters of credit on certain of our sales arrangements. We could suffer significant losses if a customer whose accounts receivable we have not secured fails or is otherwise unable to pay us. A significant loss in collections on our accounts receivable would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operation.\nWe are exposed to the risks of operating a global business, including the need to obtain export licenses for certain of our shipments and political risks in the countries we operate.\nIn 2014, approximately 89% of our net sales were generated from sales outside of the United States. We expect sales from non-U.S. markets to continue to represent a significant, and possibly increasing, portion of our sales in the future. Our non-U.S. sales and operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business outside the United States, many of which are outside our control, including:\n\u00b7 difficulties in managing a global enterprise, including staffing, managing distributors and representatives, and repatriating cash in a tax efficient manner;\n\u00b7 regional economic downturns, varying foreign government support, and unstable political environments;\n\u00b7 political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations, and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;\n\u00b7 longer sales cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u00b7 multiple, conflicting, and changing governmental laws and regulations, including import/export controls and other trade barriers;\n\u00b7 reliance on various information systems and information technology to conduct our business, which may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks by third parties or breached due to employee error, misuse or other causes that could result in business disruptions, loss of or damage to intellectual property, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, or other adverse consequences should our security practices and procedures prove ineffective, and\n\u00b7 different customs and ways of doing business.\nThese challenges, many of which are associated with sales into the Asia-Pacific region, may continue and recur again in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, political instability, terrorism, acts of war, or epidemics in regions where we operate may adversely affect or disrupt our business and results of operation.\nFurthermore, products which are either manufactured in the United States or based on U.S. technology are subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d) when exported to and re-exported from international jurisdictions, in addition to the local jurisdiction\u2019s export regulations applicable to individual shipments. Currently, our MOCVD deposition systems and certain of our other products are controlled for export under the EAR. Licenses or proper license exceptions may be required for the shipment of our products to certain countries. Obtaining an export license requires cooperation from the customer and customer-facility readiness and can add time to the order fulfillment process. While we have generally been successful in obtaining export licenses in a timely manner, there can be no assurance that this will continue or that an export license can be obtained in each instance where it is required. If an export license is required but cannot be obtained, then we will not be permitted to export the product to the customer. The administrative processing, potential delay, and risk of ultimately not obtaining an export license pose a particular disadvantage to us relative to our non-U.S. competitors who are not required to comply with U.S. export controls. Non-compliance with the EAR or other applicable export regulations could result in a wide range of penalties including the denial of export privileges, fines, criminal\npenalties, and the seizure of commodities. In the event that any export regulatory body determines that any of our shipments violate applicable export regulations, we could be fined significant sums and/or our export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and any determination that we violated these or similar laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign government officials, as defined by the statute, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, many of our customers have policies limiting or prohibiting us from providing certain types or amounts of entertainment, meals, or gifts to their employees. It is our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees and representatives. However, our safeguards may prove to be ineffective and our employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors may engage in conduct for which we may be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA or similar laws or similar customer policies may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions or the loss of supplier privileges to a customer, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nWe are subject to internal control evaluations and attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any delays or difficulty in satisfying these requirements or negative reports concerning our internal controls could adversely affect our future results of operations and our stock price.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we must include in our Annual Report on Form 10-K a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Ongoing compliance with this requirement is complex, costly, time-consuming, and is subject to significant judgment. If our internal controls are ineffective or if our management does not timely assess the adequacy of such internal controls, our ability to file timely and accurate periodic reports may be impeded. Any delays in filing may cause us to face the following risks and concerns, among others:\n\u00b7 concern on the part of our customers, partners, investors, and employees about our financial condition and filing delay status, including the potential loss of business opportunities;\n\u00b7 significant time and expense required to complete delayed filings and the distraction of our senior management team and board of directors as we work to complete delayed filings;\n\u00b7 investigations by the SEC and other regulatory authorities of the Company and of members of our management;\n\u00b7 limitations on our ability to raise capital and make acquisitions;\n\u00b7 suspension or termination of our stock listing on The NASDAQ Stock Market and the removal of our stock as a component of certain stock market indices; and\n\u00b7 general reputational harm.\nAny or all of the foregoing could result in the commencement of stockholder lawsuits against the Company. Any such litigation, as well as any proceedings that could arise as a result of a filing delay and the circumstances which gave rise to it, may be time consuming and expensive, may divert management attention from the conduct of our business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and may expose us to costly indemnification obligations to current or former officers, directors, or other personnel, regardless of the outcome of such matters, which may not be adequately covered by insurance.\nChanges in accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our financial results.\nChanges in accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results. New accounting pronouncements or taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements or taxation practices have occurred and may occur in the future. New rules, changes to existing rules, if any, or the questioning of our current or past practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or change the way we conduct our business.\nWe may be required to take additional impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets or definite-lived intangible and long-lived assets.\nWe are required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment, or on an interim basis, whenever certain events occur or circumstances change, such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount. We are also required to test our definite-lived assets, including acquired intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, for recoverability and impairment whenever there are indicators of impairment, such as an adverse change in business climate.\nAs part of our long-term strategy, we may pursue future acquisitions of other companies or assets which could potentially increase our goodwill and intangible and long-lived assets. Adverse changes in business conditions could materially impact our estimates of future operations and result in additional impairment charges to these assets. If our goodwill or intangible and long-lived assets were to become further impaired, our financial condition and results of operation could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe price of our common shares may be volatile and could decline significantly.\nThe stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies. If these market or industry-based fluctuations continue, the trading price of our common shares could decline significantly independent of our actual operating performance, and shareholders could lose all or a substantial part of their investment. The market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly in response to several factors, including, among others:\n\u00b7 general stock market conditions and uncertainty, such as those occasioned by a global liquidity crisis, negative financial news, and a failure of large financial institutions;\n\u00b7 receipt of substantial orders or cancellations for our products;\n\u00b7 issues associated with the performance and reliability of our products;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations;\n\u00b7 announcements of financial developments or technological innovations;\n\u00b7 our failure to meet the performance estimates of investment research analysts;\n\u00b7 changes in recommendations and/or financial estimates by investment research analysts;\n\u00b7 strategic transactions, such as acquisitions, divestitures, or spin-offs; and\n\u00b7 the occurrence of major catastrophic events.\nSignificant price and value fluctuations have occurred with respect to the publicly traded securities of the Company and technology companies generally. The price of our common shares is likely to be volatile in the future. In the past, securities class action litigation often has been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. If similar litigation were pursued against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation, and liquidity.\nThe enforcement and protection of our intellectual property rights may be expensive and could divert our limited resources.\nOur success depends in part upon the protection of our intellectual property rights. We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary information, technologies, and processes. We own various U.S. and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to certain of our products and technologies. The process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive, and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be circumvented, invalidated, or rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change. Policing unauthorized use of our products and technologies is difficult and time consuming. Furthermore, the laws of other countries may less effectively protect our proprietary rights than U.S. laws. Our outsourcing strategy requires that we share certain portions of our technology with our outsourcing partners, which poses additional\nrisks of infringement and trade secret misappropriation. Infringement of our rights by a third party, possibly for purposes of developing and selling competing products, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities. Similar exposure could result in the event that former employees seek to compete with us through their unauthorized use of our intellectual property and proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary information and technologies, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary intellectual property rights as fully or as readily as U.S. laws. Further, we cannot be certain that the laws and policies of any country, including the United States, with respect to intellectual property enforcement or licensing will not be changed in a way detrimental to the sale or use of our products or technology.\nWe may need to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. As a result of any such litigation, we could lose our ability to enforce one or more patents or incur substantial unexpected costs. Any action we take to enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention, which, in turn, could negatively impact our operating results. In addition, failure to protect our trademark rights could impair our brand identity.\nWe may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by others.\nFrom time to time we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent or other rights which they believe cover certain of our products. We also periodically receive notice from customers who believe that we are required to indemnify them for damages they may incur related to infringement claims made against these customers by third parties. Our customary practice is to evaluate such assertions and to consider the available alternatives, including whether to seek a license, if appropriate. However, we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or, if obtained, will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur. If we are not able to resolve a claim, negotiate a settlement of the matter, obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, and/or successfully prosecute or defend our position, our business, financial condition, and results of operation could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange risks.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks that are inherent in our anticipated sales, sales commitments, and assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Although we attempt to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, hedging activities may not always be available or adequate to eliminate, or even mitigate, the impact of our exchange rate exposure. Failure to sufficiently hedge or otherwise manage foreign currency risks properly could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation, and liquidity.\nIf we are subject to cyber-attacks we could incur substantial costs and, if such attacks are successful, significant liabilities, reputational harm, and disruption to our operations.\nWe manage, store, and transmit various proprietary information and sensitive data relating to our operations. We may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use for these purposes. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information (and/or third party confidential information), create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or our products, or that otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities.\nThe costs to address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution, or other critical functions. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive data about us or our customers or other third parties, could expose us, our customers, or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe have adopted certain measures that may have anti-takeover effects which may make an acquisition of our Company by another company more difficult.\nWe have adopted, and may in the future adopt, certain measures that may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a takeover or other change in control of our Company, any of which a holder of our common stock might not consider to be in the holder\u2019s best interest. These measures include:\n\u00b7 \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock;\n\u00b7 classified board of directors; and\n\u00b7 certain certificate of incorporation and bylaws provisions.\nOur board of directors has the authority to issue up to 500,000 shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights (including voting rights), preferences, and privileges of these shares (\u201cblank check\u201d preferred). Such preferred stock may have rights, including economic rights, senior to our common stock. As a result, the issuance of the preferred stock could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock.\nOur board of directors is divided into three classes with each class serving a staggered three-year term. The existence of a classified board will make it more difficult for our shareholders to change the composition (and therefore the policies) of our board of directors in a relatively short period of time.\nWe have adopted certain certificate of incorporation and bylaws provisions which may have anti-takeover effects. These include: (a) requiring certain actions to be taken at a meeting of shareholders rather than by written consent, (b) requiring a super-majority of shareholders to approve certain amendments to our bylaws, (c) limiting the maximum number of directors, and (d) providing that directors may be removed only for \u201ccause.\u201d These measures and those described above may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a takeover or other change in control of the Company that a holder of our common stock might consider to be in the holder\u2019s best interest.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination, including mergers and asset sales, with an interested stockholder (generally, a 15% or greater stockholder) for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The operation of Section 203 may have anti-takeover effects, which could delay, defer, or prevent a takeover attempt that a holder of our common stock might consider to be in the holder\u2019s best interest.\nDespite the above measures, an activist shareholder could undertake action to implement governance, strategic, or other changes to the Company which a holder of our common stock might not consider to be in the holder\u2019s best interest. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plans, be costly and time consuming, disrupt our operations, and divert the attention of management and our employees.\nWe are subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental, health, and safety regulations.\nWe are subject to environmental, health, and safety regulations in connection with our business operations, including but not limited to regulations related to the research, development, and use of our products. Failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations could result in significant remediation liabilities, the imposition of fines, and/or the suspension or termination of research, development, or use of certain of our products, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation. In addition, some of our operations involve the storage, handling, and use of hazardous materials that may pose a risk of fire, explosion, or environmental release. Such events could result from acts of terrorism, natural disasters, or operational failures and may result in injury or loss of life to our employees and others, local environmental contamination, and property damage. These events might cause a temporary shutdown of an affected facility, or portion thereof, and we could be subject to penalties or claims as a result. Each of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals will force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chain more complex, and may result in damage to our relationships with customers.\nOn August 22, 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted new requirements for companies that manufacture products that contain certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals. These rules require public companies to perform diligence and to report annually to the SEC whether such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. The implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of minerals we use in the manufacture of our products. In addition, we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products. Given the complexity of our supply chain, we may not be able to ascertain the origins of these minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as conflict mineral free, which could harm our relationships with these customers and lead to a loss of revenue. These new requirements could limit the pool of suppliers that can provide conflict-free minerals, and we may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at competitive prices, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability.\nWe have significant operations in locations which could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a natural disaster or other significant disruption.\nOur operations in the United States, the Asia-Pacific region, and in other areas could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including earthquakes, tsunamis, fires, hurricanes, floods, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications failures, and other natural and manmade disasters or disruptions. In the event of such a natural disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers, destruction of facilities, and/or loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operation.", "PERMNO": 81116, "SIC": 3559, "TIC": "VECO"}
