Risk Factors\nIn addition to other information referenced in this report, we are subject to a number of specific risks, which are outlined below. If any of these events occur, our business, financial condition, profitability and the market price of our Class A Common Stock could be materially affected.\nRisks Factors Related to Our Markets and Clients\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations, or fundamental changes in the operations of government agencies, could reduce demand or impact the timing for our services.\nMost of our business is driven by laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment. The current U.S. government administration has declined to enforce some environmental laws and has repealed certain regulations, adversely impacting our ability to generate revenue. Any further relaxation or repeal of these laws, or changes in governmental policies regarding the funding or enforcement of these laws, may have additional adverse impacts on our revenue. Fundamental changes in the operations of government agencies (i.e., significant agency staff reductions, changes or delays in processes for awarding contracts, and decisions to shutdown portions of the U.S. federal government) also could impact the amount or timing of our revenue. Also, reduced spending by governmental agencies may increase competition within our industry which may directly affect future revenue and profits.\nAs a federal government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement laws and regulations and government agency audits. Any violation of these laws could result in economic harm to our operations.\nRevenue from federal government contracts represented 17%, 23% and 26% of total revenue for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nWe must comply with federal laws relating to the procurement and administration of government contracts. Federal laws include the Federal Acquisition Regulation (\u201cFAR\u201d), the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Cost Accounting Standards (\u201cCAS\u201d), and the Service Contract Act. These laws impact how we do business with government clients and can increase the cost of doing business. In addition, in recent years, government agencies have mandated that their primary contractors utilize a higher portion of small and disadvantaged businesses as subcontractors.\nCertain federal government agencies, such as EPA and the Defense Contract Audit Agency (\u201cDCAA\u201d), as well as numerous state agencies, routinely audit government contractors and their performance under specific contracts to determine if a contractor\u2019s cost structure is compliant with applicable laws and regulations. They may question the incurrence of certain costs based on the FAR and CAS and disallow those costs on their contracts. These audits may occur several years after payment for services has been received. Historically, we have been able to successfully defend against the disallowance of any significant costs. However, future audits may uncover instances of noncompliance and result in material disallowances for costs previously incurred. Such material disallowances could negatively affect revenue, profits and cash flow.\nWe depend on municipal, state and federal government work for a significant portion of our revenue. Inability to win or renew government contracts during procurement cycles could significantly reduce our revenue and profits.\nGovernment contracts are typically awarded through a highly regulated procurement process. Some government contracts are awarded to multiple competitors, causing increased competition and downward pricing pressure. Inability to win or renew government contracts could adversely affect our operations and significantly reduce our revenue and profits. In addition, if we cannot reduce or control costs associated with these contracts, we may not be able to bid competitively, or unexpected losses on these contracts may occur.\nOur commercial clients may be acquired by other entities or may elect to sell their interest in ongoing projects to other entities. These transactions would subject us to increased risk of contract terminations or renegotiations.\nIf our commercial clients sell their interest in ongoing projects or are acquired by other entities, we may not be able to control or influence decisions made by the acquiring company regarding the ongoing contractual relationships of our client, including decisions to modify contracts to mitigate conflict of interest, terminate existing contracts or to award future contracts. Such decisions by acquiring companies to terminate existing contracts, or to exclude us when awarding future contracts, could have an adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations. Additionally, poor global and domestic economic conditions could impact the availability of funding for certain private environmental projects causing significant delay or cancellation of projects.\nFailure to retain or renew significant contracts with certain government and key commercial clients.\nOur failure to maintain contracts that contribute a material amount to our annual revenue could significantly reduce our income and profits if we are unable to enter into more or other contracts with new clients for similar values within the fiscal year.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Operations\nOur South American operations are subject to a number of risks.\nGross revenue from our South American operations represented 21%, 16% and 16% of consolidated gross revenue for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Compared with our U.S. operations, our South American operations are subject to a number of heightened risks, including:\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nexposure to liability and sanctions under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022\nexposure to liability and sanctions under laws and regulations established by foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business; and\n\u2022\nvolatility in economic and political conditions.\nFailure to manage these risks effectively may result in a negative impact on our future revenue, earnings, financial position and liquidity.\nFailure to attract and retain key employees during our current corporate reorganization could impair our ability to provide quality service to our clients.\nWe provide professional and technical services that depend on our ability to attract, retain and train our professional employees to conduct our business and perform our obligations to ensure success. Impacts from the Staff Reduction Programs (as defined in Item 7 of this Annual Report) may impair the corporate experience of our senior management team and other key employees that are essential to our profitability and success. Failure to effectively develop staff and complete succession planning for key senior management roles could adversely affect customer relationships, the quality of work that we complete for our clients and business development efforts.\nFailure to appoint a permanent chief executive officer in a timely manner could have a detrimental impact on our corporate strategy and success.\nFailure to appoint a permanent chief executive officer with the desired level of experience and expertise, versus an executive chairman and operating committee leading the Company, in a timely manner may impact employee, client and shareholder confidence in the Company\u2019s ability to have and implement a consistent strategic plan to perform and prosper, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nExtraordinary events, including natural disasters and terrorist actions, could negatively impact the economies in which we operate or disrupt our operations.\nThe geographic areas of our operations include regions that have experienced hurricanes, earthquakes and forest fires. The occurrence of extraordinary events such as these, as well as other natural disasters or terrorist actions, could cause the delay or cancellation of projects, closure of offices, and the evacuation or loss of personnel. Such events could limit or disrupt markets and our operations, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flows.\nFailure to establish and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting has resulted in, and may in the future result in, material misstatements in our financial statements.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting. As reported in Item 9A of this Annual Report, management identified control deficiencies as of July 31, 2018 related to the Company\u2019s accounting for its majority investment in GAC, income taxes and the financial statement close process. Management concluded that material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting existed as of July 31, 2018, and that consolidated financial statements for annual and quarterly reporting periods prior to July 31, 2018 were materially misstated. Our management has also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of July 31, 2018. We are in the process of developing and implementing a remediation plan to address the material weaknesses. Implementation of measures to remediate these material weaknesses may prove to be ineffective or inadequate and the Company may still be exposed to risk of misstatements in its financial statements. Investors and other users of the Company\u2019s financial statements could lose confidence in the reliability of the Company\u2019s financial information. The Company could be obligated to incur additional costs to improve the Company\u2019s internal controls, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation and its operating prospects. Further, if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material errors and misstatements, and we could be required to restate financial results reported in prior periods.\nInternal information technology systems or service failures could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services and products to our clients, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenue, profitability and operating results.\nOur information technology systems are subject to failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, third-party service providers, intruders or hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks. Any such failures could cause loss of data and interruptions or delays in our business, cause us to incur remediation costs, subject us to claims and damage our reputation. Failure or disruption of our communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business. Any system or service disruptions if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have a material adverse effect on our business including, among other things, an adverse effect on our ability to bill our clients for work performed on our contracts, collect the amounts that have been billed and produce accurate financial statements in a timely manner. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We have invested and will continue to pursue further investments in systems that will allow us to achieve and remain in compliance with the regulations governing our business; however, there can be no assurance that such systems will be effective at achieving and maintaining compliance or that we will not incur additional costs in order to make such systems effective.\nRisk Factors Related to Ownership and Corporate Governance\nVoting rights of an executive officer and certain directors could block or discourage a change in control.\nTwo of EEI\u2019s current directors, one of whom is also an executive officer, owned or controlled approximately 40% of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock as of March 31, 2019, which has one vote per share, while the Class A Common Stock has one-tenth of a vote per share. In addition, since the Company qualifies for the Nasdaq \u201ccontrolled company exception,\u201d there exists a group of holders of Class B Common Stock, composed principally of certain of the Company\u2019s current directors and executive officers and members of their families (the \u201cCCE Group\u201d), that controls greater than 50% of the votes that may be cast for any proposal at a shareholders meeting. This concentration of voting control by the CCE Group may effectively prevent any influence by other holders of Class A or Class B Common Stock over matters submitted to a vote by all shareholders.\nAs a result, the CCE Group has effective control over the outcome of votes on all matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including significant corporate transactions such as mergers, tender offers and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. The interests of the CCE Group could conflict with or differ from the Company\u2019s interests or the interests of other shareholders. For example, the concentration of ownership held by the CCE Group could discourage, delay, defer or prevent a change of control of the Company or impede a merger, takeover or other business combination which may otherwise be favorable for us or the Company\u2019s other shareholders.", "PERMNO": 71837, "SIC": 8711, "TIC": "EEI"}
