{"cik": "1724965", "company": "TALOS ENERGY INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile. Significant declines in commodity prices in the future may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, cash flows, access to the capital markets, and ability to grow.\nOur revenues, cash flows, profitability and future rate of growth substantially depend upon the market prices of oil and natural gas. Prices affect our cash flows available for capital expenditures and our ability to access funds under our Bank Credit Facility and through the capital markets. The amount available for borrowing under our Bank Credit Facility is subject to a borrowing base, which is determined by the lenders taking into account our estimated proved reserves, and is subject to periodic redeterminations based on pricing models to be determined by the lenders at such time. Oil and natural gas prices significantly declined in the second half of 2014, with sustained lower prices continuing throughout 2015, 2016 and 2017. Despite a modest recovery from late 2017 to mid-2018, commodity prices could remain suppressed in 2020 or decline further in the future, which will likely have material adverse effects on our proved reserves and borrowing base. Further, because we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas operations, we perform a ceiling test each quarter, which is impacted by declining prices. Significant price declines could cause us to take ceiling test write-downs, which would be reflected as non-cash charges against current earnings. See the Risk Factor entitled \u201cLower oil and natural gas prices and other factors in the future may result in ceiling test write-downs and other impairments of our asset carrying values\u201d for further discussion.\nIn addition, significant or extended price declines may also adversely affect the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. A reduction in production could result in a shortfall in our expected cash flows and require us to reduce our capital spending or borrow funds to cover any such shortfall. Any of these factors could negatively impact our ability to replace our production and our future rate of growth.\nThe markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile historically and are likely to remain volatile in the future. For example, during the period January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019, the NYMEX WTI crude oil price per Bbl ranged from a low of $45.18 to a high of $70.98, and the NYMEX natural gas price per MMBtu ranged from a low of $2.22 to a high of $4.09. Commodity prices have experienced significant further declines during the first quarter of 2020, with prices for NYMEX WTI crude oil and NYMEX natural gas, respectively, reaching lows of $31.13 per Bbl and $1.68 during the period from January 1, 2020 through March 9, 2020. The high, low and average prices for NYMEX WTI and NYMEX Henry Hub are monthly contract prices. The prices we receive for our oil and natural gas depend upon many factors beyond our control, including, among others:\n\u2022\nchanges in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nmarket uncertainty;\n\u2022\nlevel of consumer product demands;\n\u2022\nhurricanes and other adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\nthe impact of applicable market differentials, including those relating to quality, transportation, fees, energy content and regional pricing;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u2022\nprice and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic conditions in oil-producing countries, particularly those in the Middle East, Russia, South America and Africa;\n\u2022\nactions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil and natural gas price and production controls;\n\u2022\nU.S. and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nprice and quantity of oil and natural gas imports and exports;\n\u2022\nthe level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production;\n\u2022\nthe level of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022\nlocalized supply and demand fundamentals and transportation availability;\n\u2022\nspeculation as to the future price of oil and the speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts;\n\u2022\nprice and availability of competitors\u2019 supplies of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption; and\n\u2022\noverall domestic and foreign economic conditions.\nThese factors make it very difficult to predict future commodity price movements with any certainty. Substantially all of our oil and natural gas sales are made in the spot market or pursuant to contracts based on spot market prices and are not long-term fixed price contracts. Further, oil prices and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relation to each other. Because oil, natural gas and NGLs accounted for approximately 75%, 18%, and 7%, respectively, of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2019, and approximately 73%, 21%, and 6%, respectively, of our 2019 production on an MBoe basis, our financial results are sensitive to movements in oil, natural gas and NGL prices.\nOur debt level and the covenants in our current or future agreements governing our debt, including our Bank Credit Facility and the indenture for our 11.00% Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes, could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in the acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness.\nThe terms of the agreements governing our debt impose significant restrictions on our ability to take a number of actions that we may otherwise desire to take, including:\n\u2022\nincurring additional debt;\n\u2022\npaying dividends on stock, redeeming stock or redeeming subordinated debt;\n\u2022\nmaking investments;\n\u2022\ncreating liens on our assets;\n\u2022\nselling assets;\n\u2022\nguaranteeing other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nentering into agreements that restrict dividends from our subsidiaries to us;\n\u2022\nmerging, consolidating or transferring all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nhedging future production; and\n\u2022\nentering into transactions with affiliates.\nOur level of indebtedness, and the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt, including the Bank Credit Facility and the indenture for our 11.00% Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2022 (the \u201c11.00% Notes\u201d) of Talos Production Inc. and Talos Production Finance, Inc. (together, the \u201cTalos Issuers\u201d), have important consequences on our operations, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring that we dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operating activities to required payments on debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures, and other general business activities;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general business activities;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\ndetracting from our ability to successfully withstand a downturn in our business or the economy generally;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage against other less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nmaking us vulnerable to increases in interest rates because debt under our Bank Credit Facility is at variable rates.\nWe may be required to repay all or a portion of our debt on an accelerated basis in certain circumstances. If we fail to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in the agreements governing our debt, it could lead to an event of default and the acceleration of repayment of outstanding debt. Our ability to comply with these covenants and other restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic and financial conditions. Sustained low oil and natural gas prices have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity position. Our cash flow is highly dependent on the prices we receive for oil and natural gas, which have declined significantly as compared to mid-2014.\nWe depend on our Bank Credit Facility for a portion of our future capital needs. We are required to comply with certain debt covenants and certain financial ratios under the Bank Credit Facility. Our borrowing base under the Bank Credit Facility, which is redetermined semi-annually, is based on an amount established by the lenders after their evaluation of our proved oil and natural gas reserve values. If, due to a redetermination of our borrowing base, our outstanding borrowings plus outstanding letters of credit exceed our redetermined borrowing base (referred to as a borrowing base deficiency), we could be required to repay such borrowing base deficiency. Our Bank Credit Facility allows us to cure a borrowing base deficiency through any combination of the following actions: (i) repay amounts outstanding sufficient to cure the borrowing base deficiency within 30 days after the existence of such deficiency; (ii) add additional oil and gas properties acceptable to the banks to the borrowing base and take such actions necessary to grant the banks a mortgage in such oil and gas properties within 30 days after the existence of such deficiency; (iii) pay the deficiency in four equal monthly installments with the first installment due within 30 days after the existence of such deficiency; or (iv) any combination of the above. We are required to elect one of the foregoing options within 10 days after the existence of such deficiency.\nWe may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments. If we do not repay our debt out of cash on hand, we could attempt to restructure or refinance such debt, reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, sell assets, or repay such debt with the proceeds from an equity offering. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to pay the interest on our debt or that future borrowings, equity financings or proceeds from the sale of assets are available to pay or refinance such debt. Any refinancing of indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict business operations. The terms of our debt, including our Bank Credit Facility and the indenture for our 11.00% Notes, may also prohibit us from taking such actions. Factors that affect our ability to raise cash through offerings of our capital stock, a refinancing of our debt or a sale of assets include financial market conditions and our market value and operating performance at the time of such offerings, refinancing or sale of assets. We cannot assure you that any such offerings, restructuring, refinancing or sale of assets would be successfully completed.\nChanges in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) in the United Kingdom announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021, or whether different benchmark rates used to price indebtedness will develop. In the future, we may need to renegotiate the Bank Credit Facility or incur other indebtedness, and the phase-out of LIBOR may negatively impact the terms of such indebtedness. In addition, the overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial market could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nRegulatory requirements and permitting procedures imposed by BOEM and BSEE could significantly delay our ability to obtain permits to drill new wells in offshore waters.\nBSEE and BOEM have imposed new and more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for new wells to be drilled in federal waters. Compliance with these added and more stringent regulatory requirements and with existing environmental and spill regulations, together with uncertainties or inconsistencies in decisions and rulings by governmental agencies and delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration, development, oil spill response and decommissioning plans and possible additional regulatory initiatives could result in difficult and more costly actions and adversely affect or delay new drilling and ongoing development efforts. Moreover, these governmental agencies are continuing to evaluate aspects of safety and operational performance in the United States Gulf of Mexico and, as a result, are continuing to develop and implement new, more restrictive requirements. For example, in 2016, BSEE under the Obama Administration published a final rule on well control that, among other things, imposes rigorous standards relating to the design, operation and maintenance of blow-out preventers, real-time monitoring of deepwater, high temperature, high pressure drilling activities and enhanced reporting requirements. However, pursuant to President Trump\u2019s Executive Orders, BSEE initiated a review of the well control regulations to determine whether the rules are consistent with the stated policy of encouraging energy exploration and production, while ensuring that any such activity is safe and environmentally responsible. One consequence of this review is that on May 15, 2019, BSEE published final revisions to the existing 2016 rule on well control that became effective on July 15, 2019 and, among other things, eliminated the requirement for offshore operators to certify through an independent third party that their critical safety and pollution prevention equipment (e.g., subsea safety equipment, including blowout preventers) is operational and functioning as designed in the most extreme conditions. There exists the possibility that any mitigatory actions under the Trump Administration could be withdrawn or revised in the future as a result of litigation or by a different presidential administration to impose or re-implement more stringent standards.\nCompliance with these regulatory actions, or any new laws, regulations or other legal initiatives, whether under the Trump Administration or another administration could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business. Furthermore, among other adverse impacts, to the extent that BOEM and BSEE do not reduce the stringency of existing oil and gas safety and performance-related regulations and other regulatory initiatives, the regulatory requirements imposed by such existing or future, more stringent regulations or other regulatory initiatives could delay operations, disrupt our operations or increase the risk of leases expiring before exploration and development efforts have been completed due to the time required to develop new technology. Additionally, if left unchanged, the existing, or future, more stringent oil and gas safety and performance-related regulations and other regulatory initiatives imposed by BOEM and BSEE could result in incurrence of associated added costs, limit operational activities in certain areas or cause us to incur penalties or shut-in production at one or more of our facilities. Also, if material spill incidents were to occur in the future, the United States or other countries where such an event may occur could elect to issue directives to temporarily cease drilling activities and, in any event, may from time to time issue further safety and environmental laws and regulations regarding offshore oil and natural gas exploration and development, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict with any certainty the full impact of any new laws or regulations on our drilling operations or on the cost or availability of insurance to cover some or all of the risks associated with such operations.\nFinally, due primarily to the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions, certain candidates seeking the office of President of the United States in 2020 have pledged to take actions to ban new mineral leases on federal properties, including offshore leases on the OCS.\nGuidelines issued by BOEM related to financial assurance requirements to cover decommissioning obligations for operations on the OCS may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nBOEM requires that lessees demonstrate financial strength and reliability according to its regulations or provide acceptable financial assurances to assure satisfaction of lease obligations, including decommissioning activities on the OCS. In 2016, BOEM under the Obama Administration issued the 2016 NTL to clarify the procedures and guidelines that BOEM Regional Directors use to determine if and when additional financial assurances may be required for OCS leases, ROWs or RUEs. The 2016 NTL became effective in September 2016, but pursuant to President Trump\u2019s Executive Orders, BOEM initiated a review of the 2016 NTL and extended implementation indefinitely beyond June 30, 2017, except in certain circumstances where there is a substantial risk of nonperformance of the interest holder\u2019s decommissioning liabilities, so as to provide BOEM with time to review its complex financial assurance program.\nFollowing the effectiveness of the 2016 NTL, we received the BOEM 2016 Orders in late 2016 directing us to provide additional financial assurance in material amounts relating to our OCS properties. We entered into discussions with BOEM regarding the requested additional financial security and submitted a proposed tailored plan for the posting of additional financial security to the agency for review. However, as noted, BOEM under the Trump Administration has indefinitely delayed beyond June 30, 2017 implementation of the 2016 NTL, has rescinded the BOEM 2016 Orders while BOEM reviews its financial assurance program and, to date, has taken no action with respect to our previously submitted proposed tailored plan.\nAs of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have no outstanding BOEM orders for financial assurance obligations. Until BOEM and BSEE\u2019s completion and publication of its proposed joint rule regarding financial assurance, we cannot estimate what additional financial assurance may be required by us, and therefore, we cannot provide any assurance of the amount of any additional financial assurance, which may be material, that may be ordered by BOEM and required of us in the future, or that such additional financial assurance amounts can be obtained. Moreover, BOEM, whether under the Trump Administration or another administration, could in the future make new demands for additional financial assurances in material amounts relating to the decommissioning of our OCS properties. BOEM may reject our proposals to satisfy any such additional financial assurance coverage and make demands that exceed our capabilities.\nIf we fail to comply with the current or future orders of BOEM to provide additional surety bonds or other financial assurances, BOEM could commence enforcement proceedings or take other remedial action, including assessing civil penalties, suspending operations or production, or initiating procedures to cancel leases, which, if upheld, would have a material adverse effect on our business, properties, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, if fully implemented, the 2016 NTL is likely to result in the loss of supplemental bonding waivers for a large number of operators on the OCS, which could in turn force these operators to seek additional surety bonds and could, consequently, challenge the surety bond market\u2019s capacity for providing such additional financial assurance. Operators who have already leveraged their assets as a result of the declining oil market could face difficulty obtaining surety bonds because of concerns the surety companies may have about the priority of their lien on the operator\u2019s collateral. Moreover, depressed oil prices could result in sureties seeking additional collateral to support existing bonds, such as cash or letters of credit, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to satisfy collateral demands for future bonds to comply with supplemental bonding requirements of BOEM. If we are required to provide collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit, our liquidity position could be negatively impacted and we may be required to seek alternative financing. To the extent we are unable to secure adequate financing, we may be forced to reduce our capital expenditures. All of these factors may make it more difficult for us to obtain the financial assurances required by BOEM to conduct operations on the OCS. These and other changes to BOEM bonding and financial assurance requirements could result in increased costs on our operations and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur operations may incur substantial liabilities to comply with environmental laws and regulations as well as legal requirements applicable to marine mammals and endangered and threatened species.\nOur oil and natural gas operations are subject to stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the release or disposal of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations:\n\u2022\nrequire the acquisition of a permit or other approval before drilling or other regulated activity commences;\n\u2022\nrestrict the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities;\n\u2022\nlimit or prohibit exploration or drilling activities on certain lands lying within protected areas or that may affect certain marine species and endangered and threatened species; and\n\u2022\nimpose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in:\n\u2022\nthe assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nloss of our leases;\n\u2022\nincurrence of investigatory, remedial or corrective obligations; and\n\u2022\nthe imposition of injunctive relief, which could prohibit, limit or restrict our operations in a particular area.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our industry in general and on our own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. Under these environmental laws and regulations, we could incur strict joint and several liability for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or contamination, regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination and regardless of whether our operations met previous standards in the industry at the time they were conducted. Our permits require that we report any incidents that cause or could cause environmental damages.\nNew laws and regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement could significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating costs or could result in delays, limitations or cancelations to our exploration and production activities, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. See Business - Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Regulations under Part I, Item 1 in this Form 10-K for a more detailed description of our environmental, marine species, and endangered and threatened species legal requirements.\nA financial crisis may impact our business and financial condition and may adversely impact our ability to obtain funding under our Bank Credit Facility or in the capital markets.\nWe use our cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under our Bank Credit Facility to fund our capital expenditures, and we rely on the capital markets and asset monetization transactions to provide us with additional capital for large or exceptional transactions. However, we may not be able to access adequate funding under our Bank Credit Facility as a result of (i) a decrease in our borrowing base due to the outcome of a borrowing base redetermination or a breach or default under our Bank Credit Facility, including a breach of a financial covenant or (ii) an unwillingness or inability on the part of our lending counterparties to meet their funding obligations. In addition, we may face limitations on our ability to access the debt and equity capital markets and complete asset sales, an increased counterparty credit risk on our derivatives contracts, and the requirement by our contractual counterparties to post collateral guaranteeing performance.\nWe require substantial capital expenditures to conduct our operations and replace our production, and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms necessary to fund our planned capital expenditures.\nWe spend a substantial amount of capital for the acquisition, exploration, exploitation, development, and production of oil and natural gas reserves. We fund our capital expenditures primarily through operating cash flows, cash on hand and borrowings under our Bank Credit Facility, if necessary. The actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, oil and natural gas prices, actual drilling results, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment, and regulatory, technological and competitive developments. A further reduction in commodity prices may result in a further decrease in our actual capital expenditures, which would negatively impact our ability to grow production.\nOur cash flow from operations and access to capital is subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022\nour proved reserves;\n\u2022\nthe level of hydrocarbons we are able to produce from our wells;\n\u2022\nthe prices at which our production is sold;\n\u2022\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves; and\n\u2022\nour ability to borrow under our Bank Credit Facility.\nIf low oil and natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or other factors, many of which are beyond our control, cause our revenues, cash flows from operating activities, and the borrowing base under our Bank Credit Facility to decrease, we may be limited in our ability to fund the capital necessary to complete our capital expenditure program. After utilizing our available sources of financing, we may be forced to raise additional debt or equity proceeds to fund such capital expenditures. We cannot be sure that additional debt or equity financing will be available, and we cannot be sure that cash flows provided by operations will be sufficient to meet these requirements. For example, the ability of oil and gas companies to access the equity and high yield debt markets has been, and continues to be, significantly limited since the significant decline in commodity prices as compared to mid-2014.\nWe are a holding company that has no material assets other than our ownership of the equity interests of Talos Production Inc. Accordingly, we are dependent upon distributions from Talos Production Inc. to pay taxes, cover our corporate and other overhead expenses and pay dividends, if any, on our common stock.\nWe are a holding company that has no material assets other than our ownership of the equity interests of Talos Production Inc. We have no independent means of generating revenue. To the extent Talos Production Inc. has available cash, we will cause Talos Production Inc. to make distributions of cash to us, directly and indirectly through our wholly owned subsidiaries, to pay taxes, cover our corporate and other overhead expenses and pay dividends, if any, on our common stock. As we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, we anticipate that any available cash, other than the cash distributed to us to pay taxes and cover our corporate and other overhead expenses, will be retained by Talos Production Inc. to satisfy its operational and other cash needs. Accordingly, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Although we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock, if our board of directors decides to do so in the future, our ability to do so may be limited to the extent Talos Production Inc. is limited in its ability to make distributions to us, including the significant restrictions the agreements governing Talos Production Inc.\u2019s debt impose on the ability of Talos Production Inc. to make distributions and other payments to us. To the extent that we need funds and Talos Production Inc. is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of our financing agreements, or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nOur production, revenue and cash flow from operating activities are derived from assets that are concentrated in a single geographic area, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one geographic area.\nOur production, revenue, and cash flow from operating activities are derived from assets that are concentrated in a single geographic area, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and in the shallow waters off the coast of Mexico. Unlike other entities that are geographically diversified, we may not have the resources to effectively diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. Our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have an adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we operate, and result in our dependency upon a single or limited number of hydrocarbon basins. In addition, the geographic concentration of our properties in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and in the shallow waters off the coast of Mexico means that some or all of our properties could be affected should the region experience:\n\u2022\nsevere weather, such as hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\ndelays or decreases in production or the availability of equipment, facilities or services;\n\u2022\ndelays or decreases in the availability or capacity to transport, gather or process production;\n\u2022\nchanges in the status of pipelines that we depend on for transportation of our production to the marketplace;\n\u2022\nextensive governmental regulation (including regulations that may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for pollution damage or require posting substantial bonds to address decommissioning and P&A costs) and interruption or termination of operations by governmental authorities based on environmental, safety or other considerations;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory environment such as the guidelines issued by BOEM related to financial assurance requirements to cover decommissioning obligations for operations on the OCS; and/or\n\u2022\nchanges imposed as a result of litigation or by a new presidential administration or by the Congress in the United States that may result in added restrictions and delays or prohibitions in offshore oil and natural gas exploration and production activities, including with respect to permitting, site development or operation in federal waters, or hydraulic fracturing.\nBecause all or a number of our properties could experience many of the same conditions at the same time, these conditions may have a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other producers who have properties over a wider geographic area.\nWe may experience significant shut-ins and losses of production due to the effects of hurricanes in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and in the shallow waters off the coast of Mexico.\nOur production is primarily associated with our properties in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and in the shallow waters off the coast of Mexico. Accordingly, if the level of production from these properties substantially declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production level and our revenue. We are particularly vulnerable to significant risk from hurricanes and tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico. We are unable to predict what impact future hurricanes and tropical storms might have on our future results of operations and production.\nA significant portion of our production, revenue and cash flow is concentrated in our Phoenix Field and our Pompano Field. Because of this concentration, any production problems, impacts of adverse weather or inaccuracies in reserve estimates could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 32% and 21% of our production and 34% and 24% of our oil, natural gas, and NGL revenue was attributable to our Phoenix Field and our Pompano Field, respectively, both of which are located in the federal waters offshore in the United States Gulf of Mexico. This concentration in these fields means that any impact on our production from these fields, whether because of mechanical problems, adverse weather, well containment activities, changes in the regulatory environment, or otherwise, could have a material effect on our business. We produce the Phoenix Field through the HP-I, a dynamically positioned floating production facility that is operated by Helix. The HP-I interconnects the Phoenix Field through a production buoy that can be disconnected if the HP-I cannot maintain its position on station, such as in the event of a mechanical problem with the dynamic positioning system or the approach of a hurricane. Because the HP-I may have to be disconnected from the Phoenix Field if circumstances require, our production from the Phoenix Field may be subject to more frequent interruptions than if the Phoenix Field was produced by a more conventional platform. We are also required to disconnect and dry-dock the HP-I every two to three years for inspection as required by the United States Coast Guard, during which time we are unable to produce the Phoenix Field. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Helix dry-docked the HP-1. After conducting sea trials, production resumed in late March 2019, resulting in a total shut-in period of 57 days.\nThe HP-I is part of the Helix Well Containment Group (\u201cHWCG\u201d), which is a consortium that is available to respond to any deepwater well control event, such as the Macondo well oil spill. If such an event were to occur and the HWCG was to be utilized for well control, the HP-I, which is the vessel that would be used to respond to the deepwater well control event, would be required to disconnect from the Phoenix Field until such time as the well control event was resolved and the HP-I could return to the Phoenix Field. During such time period, we would not be able to produce the Phoenix Field. In the event the HP-I has to disconnect from the Phoenix Field, our production, revenue, and cash flow could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, all of our production from the Phoenix Field flows through the Green Canyon 19 connection facility operated by Shell GOM Pipeline Company LLC. To the extent Shell GOM Pipeline Company LLC temporarily shuts in its Green Canyon 19 connection facility, whether for maintenance or otherwise, we would not be able to produce the Phoenix Field during this period of time, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf the actual reserves associated with the Phoenix Field are less than our estimated reserves, such a reduction of reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, all of our production from the Pompano Field flows through the Pompano Pipeline System operated by Crimson Gulf LLC. To the extent Crimson Gulf LLC temporarily shuts in the Pompano Pipeline System, whether for maintenance or otherwise, we would not be able to produce the Pompano Field during this period of time, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf the actual reserves associated with the Pompano Field are less than our estimated reserves, such a reduction of reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are not insured against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed.\nIn accordance with industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the operating risks to which our business is exposed. We insure some, but not all, of our properties from operational loss-related events. We have insurance policies that include coverage for general liability, physical damage to our oil and gas properties, operational control of well, named Gulf of Mexico windstorm, oil pollution, construction all risk, workers\u2019 compensation and employers\u2019 liability and other coverage. Our insurance coverage includes deductibles that have to be met prior to recovery, as well as sub-limits or self-insurance. Additionally, our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations, and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences, damages or losses.\nWe have general liability insurance coverage with an annual aggregate limit of $500 million. We selectively purchase physical damage insurance coverage for our pipelines, platforms, facilities and umbilicals for losses resulting from named windstorms and operational activities.\nOur operational control of well coverage is expected to provide limits that vary by well location and depth and range from a combined single limit of $25 million to $500 million per occurrence. Exploratory deepwater wells have a coverage limit of up to $500 million per occurrence. Additionally, we maintain up to $150 million in oil pollution liability coverage. Our operational control of well and physical damage policy limits is scaled proportionately to our working interests. Our general liability program utilizes a combination of assured\u2019s interest and scalable limits. All of our policies described above are subject to deductibles, sub-limits, or self-insurance. Under our service agreements, including drilling contracts, generally we are indemnified for injuries and death of the service provider\u2019s employees as well as contractors and subcontractors hired by the service provider, subject to the application of various states\u2019 laws.\nAn operational or hurricane or other adverse weather-related event may cause damage or liability in excess of our coverage that might severely impact our financial position. We may be liable for damages from an event relating to a project in which we own a non-operating working interest. Such events may also cause a significant interruption to our business, which might also severely impact our financial position. We may experience production interruptions for which we do not have production interruption insurance.\nWe reevaluate the purchase of insurance, policy limits and terms annually. Future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable. No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable, and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage. We may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations. This may cause us to restrict our operations in the Gulf of Mexico, which might severely impact our financial position. The occurrence of a significant event, not fully insured against, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLower oil and natural gas prices and other factors in the future may result in ceiling test write-downs and other impairments of our asset carrying values.\nWe use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas operations. Accordingly, we capitalize the costs to acquire, explore for and develop oil and gas properties. Under the full cost method of accounting, we compare, at the end of each financial reporting period for each cost center, the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves (based on a trailing 12-month average, hedge-adjusted commodity price and excluding cash flows related to estimated abandonment costs), to the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties, net of related deferred taxes. We refer to this comparison as a ceiling test. If the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties exceed the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves, we are required to write down the value of our oil and gas properties to the value of the estimated discounted future net cash flows. A write-down of oil and gas properties does not impact cash flows from operating activities, but does reduce net income. The risk that we are required to write-down the carrying value of oil and gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are low or volatile. In addition, write-downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or our undeveloped property values, or if estimated future development costs increase. Volatility in commodity prices, poor conditions in the global economic markets and other factors could cause us to record additional write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties and other assets in the future, and incur additional charges against future earnings. Any required write-downs or impairments could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur oil and gas operations are subject to various international, foreign and U.S. federal, state and local governmental regulations that materially affect our operations.\nOur oil and gas operations are subject to various international, foreign and U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations may be changed in response to economic or political conditions. Regulated matters include: permits for exploration, development and production operations; limitations on our drilling activities in environmentally sensitive areas, such as marine habitats, and restrictions on the way we can discharge materials into the environment; bonds or other financial responsibility requirements to cover drilling contingencies and well P&A and other decommissioning costs; reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells and unitization and pooling of properties; regulations regarding the rate, terms and conditions of transportation service or the price, terms, and conditions related to the purchase and sale of oil and natural gas; and taxation. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the issuance of remedial obligations and the imposition of injunctions limiting or prohibiting certain of our operations. In addition, because we hold federal leases, the federal government requires that we comply with numerous additional regulations applicable to government contractors.\nIn July 2017, we, along with partners Sierra and Premier, reported the discovery of a significant reservoir of crude oil in the Sureste Basin offshore Mexico through the Zama-1 well. Data from the Zama-1 well indicates that it is possible the deposit could be part of a field that extends into an exploration block in which the state entity Pemex holds exploration and development rights.\nThe Ministry of Energy of Mexico has promulgated guidelines to establish procedures for conducting the unitization of shared reservoirs and approving the terms and conditions of unitization and unit operating agreements, as well as the authority to direct parties holding rights in a potentially shared reservoir to appraise and potentially form a unit for development of such reservoir.\nEven with the final regulations in place, there are still some uncertainties regarding the unitization process, including the selection of a unit operator and the exact length of time that it will take to obtain approvals of any unit agreements. Any unit operating agreement eventually agreed to by the relevant parties or any unit order issued by a governmental entity in Mexico could be adverse to us and affect the value that we are able to recognize from the reservoir discovery, including but not limited to an agreement or unit order that would require us to allow a third party to develop and produce the crude oil reservoir identified through the Zama-1 well.\nIn September 2015, we, together with our consortium partners executed a PSC with the CNH for each of Blocks 2 and 7 of Round 1. The PSCs require that the consortium execute a minimum work program expressed in work units during a four-year exploration period. Effective January 23, 2018, the activities already performed on Block 7 have satisfied the minimum work program on Block 7. Effective September 4, 2019, the activities already performed on Block 2 have satisfied the minimum work program on Block 2. As a result of the 2019 drilling program, pending government approval, the activities already performed on Block 31 have satisfied the minimum work program on Block 31.\nOur Mexican operations are subject to certain offshore regulatory and environmental laws and regulations promulgated by Mexico.\nOur operations on oil and natural gas blocks in shallow waters off the coast of Mexico\u2019s Veracruz and Tabasco states, and in other Mexican offshore areas where we are assessing other exploration opportunities, are subject to regulation by the SENER, the CNH and other Mexican regulatory bodies. The CNH is responsible for, among other things, overseeing the tender procedures for awarding contracts for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in Mexican waters, managing and supervising contracts that have been awarded, and approving exploration and production plans. The PSCs that we and our consortium partners have entered into for the development of these acreages contain terms that impose on us the duty to comply with various laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons (including certain national content requirements), the treatment, conveyance, marketing, transport and storage of petroleum, requirements for industrial safety, operational security, and facility decommissioning. Failure to comply can result in the imposition of monetary penalties, revocation of permits, rescission of the relevant PSC, suspension of operations, and ordered decommissioning of offshore facilities and systems. The laws and regulations governing activities in the Mexican energy sector are relatively new, having been significantly reformed in 2013, and the legal regulatory framework continues to evolve as SENER, the CNH and other Mexican regulatory bodies issue new regulations and guidance. Such regulations are subject to change, and it is possible that SENER, the CNH or other Mexican regulatory bodies may impose new or revised requirements that could increase our operating costs and/or capital expenditures for operations in Mexican offshore waters.\nIn addition, our operations on oil and natural gas blocks in shallow waters off the coast of Mexico\u2019s Veracruz and Tabasco states, and in other Mexican offshore areas where we are assessing other exploration opportunities, are subject to regulation by the ASEA. We must obtain ASEA-issued permits and comply with ASEA regulations governing hydrocarbon activities, including requirements for environmental impact and risk assessments, industrial safety, waste management, water and air emissions, operational security and facility decommissioning. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in the imposition of monetary penalties, revocation of permits, suspension of operations and ordered decommissioning of offshore facilities and systems. The laws and regulations governing the protection of health, safety and the environment from activities in the Mexican energy sector are relatively new, having been significantly reformed in 2013 and 2014, and the legal regulatory framework continues to evolve as ASEA and other Mexican regulatory bodies issue new regulations and guidance. Such regulations are subject to change, and it is possible that ASEA or other Mexican regulatory bodies may impose new or revised requirements that could increase our operating costs and/or capital expenditures for operations in Mexican offshore waters. For example, in January 2019, the ASEA published the \u201cGeneral Administrative Provisions on the Guidelines for the Design, Construction, Pre-start, Maintenance, Closing, Dismantling and Abandonment of the Facilities and Transfer Operations associated with the Transportation and/or Distribution of Hydrocarbons and/or Oil Products activities, by means other than Pipelines.\u201d These legal provisions apply to permit holders in charge of the transportation or distribution of hydrocarbons and oil products by means other than pipelines, such as tank trucks, tank vessels and/or by railroad, in connection with the transfer, racking, loading, discharge, reception or delivery of such hydrocarbons and oil products. The permit holders must comply with requirements relating to insurance, facility construction and design, law compliance, and risk analysis scenarios.\nUnder the PSCs, we are also jointly and severally liable for the performance of all obligations under the PSCs, including exploration, appraisal, extraction and abandonment activities and compliance with all environmental regulations, and failure to perform such obligations could result in contractual rescission of the PSCs.\nProduction periods or reserve lives for Gulf of Mexico properties may subject us to higher reserve replacement needs and may impair our ability to reduce production during periods of low oil and natural gas prices.\nSubstantially all of our operations are in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result, our reserve replacement needs from new prospects may be greater than those of other oil and gas companies with longer-life reserves in other producing areas. Our future oil and natural gas production is highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves at a unit cost that is sustainable at prevailing commodity prices.\nExploring for, developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive and uncertain. We may not be able to economically find, develop or acquire additional reserves or make the necessary capital investments if our cash flows from operations decline or external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. Our need to generate revenues to fund ongoing capital commitments or repay debt may limit our ability to slow or shut-in production from producing wells during periods of low prices for oil and natural gas. We cannot assure you that our future exploitation, exploration, development and acquisition activities will result in additional proved reserves or that we will be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs. Further, current market conditions may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing to fund acquisitions, and they have lowered the level of activity and depressed values in the oil and natural gas property sales market.\nOur actual recovery of reserves may substantially differ from our proved reserve estimates.\nEstimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves and the estimated future net cash flows from such reserves are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. This process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir and is therefore inherently imprecise. Additionally, our interpretations of the rules governing the estimation of proved reserves could differ from the interpretation of staff members of regulatory authorities resulting in estimates that could be challenged by these authorities.\nActual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will most likely vary from those estimated. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves. Our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nYou should not assume that any present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves represents the market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. We base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves at December 31, 2019 on historical 12-month average prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. Further, actual future net revenues are affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of capital expenditures and decommissioning costs;\n\u2022\nthe rate and timing of production;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental legislation, regulations or taxation;\n\u2022\nvolume, pricing and duration of our oil and natural gas hedging contracts;\n\u2022\nsupply of and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nactual prices we receive for oil and natural gas; and\n\u2022\nour actual operating costs in producing oil and natural gas.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties affects the timing of actual future net cash flows from reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor that we use to calculate the net present value of future net revenues and cash flows may not necessarily be the most appropriate discount factor based on our cost of capital in effect from time to time and the risks associated with our business and the oil and gas industry in general.\nAt December 31, 2019, approximately 31% of our estimated proved reserves (by volume) were undeveloped and approximately 21% were non-producing. Any or all of our PUD or proved developed non-producing reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced. Furthermore, any or all of our undeveloped and developed non-producing reserves may not be ultimately produced during the time periods we plan or at the costs we budget, which could result in the write-off of previously recognized reserves. Recovery of undeveloped reserves generally requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling or waterflood operations. Our reserve estimates include the assumptions that we incur capital expenditures to develop these undeveloped reserves and the actual costs and results associated with these properties may not be as estimated. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions materially affects the quantities and present value of our reserves, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThree-dimensional seismic interpretation does not guarantee that hydrocarbons are present or if present, produce in economic quantities.\nWe rely on 3D seismic studies to assist us with assessing prospective drilling opportunities on our properties, as well as on properties that we may acquire. Such seismic studies are merely an interpretive tool and do not necessarily guarantee that hydrocarbons are present or, if present, produce in economic quantities, and seismic indications of hydrocarbon saturation are generally not reliable indicators of productive reservoir rock. These limitations of 3D seismic data may impact our drilling and operational results, and consequently our financial condition.\nSEC rules could limit our ability to book additional PUD reserves in the future.\nSEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, PUD reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking. This requirement may limit our ability to book additional PUD reserves as we pursue our drilling program. Moreover, we may be required to write down our PUD reserves if we do not drill those wells within the required five-year timeframe.\nOur acreage has to be drilled before lease expiration in order to hold the acreage by production. If commodity prices become depressed for an extended period of time, it might not be economical for us to drill sufficient wells in order to hold acreage, which could result in the expiry of a portion of our acreage, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nUnless production is established as required by the leases covering the undeveloped acres, the leases for such acreage may expire.\nOur drilling plans for areas not held by production are subject to change based upon various factors. Many of these factors are beyond our control, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. On the acreage that we do not operate, we have less control over the timing of drilling, and therefore there is additional risk of expirations occurring in those sections.\nThe marketability of our production depends mostly upon the availability, proximity, and capacity of oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities.\nThe marketability of our production depends upon the availability, proximity, operation and capacity of oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities. The lack of availability or capacity of these gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities could result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. The disruption of these gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities due to maintenance and/or weather could negatively impact our ability to market and deliver our products. Federal, state, and local regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation, general economic conditions, and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market our oil and natural gas. If market factors changed dramatically, the financial impact could be substantial. The availability of markets and the volatility of product prices are beyond our control and represent a significant risk.\nOur actual production could differ materially from our forecasts.\nFrom time to time, we may provide forecasts of expected quantities of future oil and gas production. These forecasts are based on a number of estimates, including expectations of production from existing wells. In addition, our forecasts may assume that none of the risks associated with our oil and natural gas operations summarized in this section would occur, such as facility or equipment malfunctions, adverse weather effects or significant declines in commodity prices or material increases in costs, which could make certain production uneconomical.\nOur operations are subject to numerous risks of oil and natural gas drilling and production activities.\nOil and gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reserves are found. The cost of drilling and completing wells is often uncertain. To the extent we drill additional wells in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater and/or in the Gulf Coast deep gas, our drilling activities increase capital cost. In addition, the geological complexity of the areas in which we have oil and natural gas operations make it more difficult for us to sustain the historical rates of drilling success. Oil and natural gas drilling and production activities may be shortened, delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022\npressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022\nhurricanes and other adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\nshortages in experienced labor; and\n\u2022\nshortages or delays in the delivery of equipment.\nThe prevailing prices of oil and natural gas also affect the cost of and the demand for drilling rigs, production equipment and related services. We cannot assure you that the wells we drill will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment. Drilling for oil and natural gas may be unprofitable. Drilling activities can result in dry holes and wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient cash flows to recoup drilling costs.\nOur industry experiences numerous operating risks.\nThe exploration, development and production of oil and gas properties involves a variety of operating risks, including the risk of fire, explosions, blowouts, pipe failure, abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards. Environmental hazards include oil spills, gas leaks, pipeline ruptures or discharges of toxic gases. We are also involved in completion operations that utilize hydraulic fracturing, which may potentially present additional operational and environmental risks. Additionally, our offshore operations are subject to the additional hazards of marine operations, such as capsizing, collisions and adverse weather and sea conditions, including the effects of hurricanes.\nIn addition, an oil spill on or related to our properties and operations could expose us to joint and several strict liability, without regard to fault, under applicable law for containment and oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil, natural resource damages and economic damages suffered by persons adversely affected by an oil spill. If an oil discharge or substantial threat of discharge were to occur, we could be liable for costs and damages, which costs and damages could be material to our results of operations and financial position.\nOur business is also subject to the risks and uncertainties normally associated with the exploration for and development and production of oil and natural gas that are beyond our control, including uncertainties as to the presence, size and recoverability of hydrocarbons. We may not encounter commercially productive oil and natural gas reservoirs. We may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells. The presence of unanticipated pressures or irregularities in formations, miscalculations or accidents may cause our drilling activities to be unsuccessful and/or result in a total loss of our investment, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we may be uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling, completing and operating wells.\nWe have an interest in deepwater fields and may attempt to pursue additional operational activity in the future and acquire additional fields and leases in the deepwaters of the Gulf of Mexico. Exploration for oil or natural gas in the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico generally involves greater operational and financial risks than exploration in the shallower waters of the Gulf of Mexico conventional shelf. Deepwater drilling generally requires more time and more advanced drilling technologies, involving a higher risk of technological failure and usually higher drilling costs. For example, the drilling of deepwater wells requires specific types of drilling rigs with significantly higher day rates and limited availability as compared to the rigs used in shallower water. Deepwater wells often use subsea completion techniques with subsea trees tied back to host production facilities with flow lines. The installation of these subsea trees and flow lines requires substantial time and the use of advanced remote installation mechanics. These operations may encounter mechanical difficulties and equipment failures that could result in cost overruns. Furthermore, the deepwater operations generally lack the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in the shallower waters of the Gulf of Mexico conventional shelf. As a result, a considerable amount of time may elapse between a deepwater discovery and the marketing of the associated oil or natural gas, increasing both the financial and operational risk involved with these operations. Because of the lack and high cost of infrastructure, some reserve discoveries in the deepwater may never be produced economically.\nIf any of these industry operating risks occur, we could have substantial losses. Substantial losses may be caused by injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation and penalties, suspension of operations and production and repairs to resume operations. Any of these industry operating risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be negatively affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, terrorist attacks and other disruptions.\nAs an oil and gas producer, we have various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable, threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines, and threats from terrorist acts. The potential for such security threats subjects our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, the implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls are sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. These events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability.\nThe U.S. government has issued warnings that U.S. energy assets may be the future targets of terrorist organizations. These developments subject our operations to increased risks. Any future terrorist attack at our facilities, or those of our purchasers or vendors, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nEvents outside of our control, including an epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (or COVID-19), may materially adversely affect our business.\nWe face risks related to epidemics, outbreaks or other public health events that are outside of our control, and could significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial condition. For example, the recent outbreak in Wuhan, China of COVID-19, which has spread across the globe and impacted financial markets and worldwide economic activity, may adversely affect our operations or the health of our workforce by rendering employees or contractors unable to work or unable to access our facilities for an indefinite period of time. In addition, the effects of COVID-19 and concerns regarding its global spread could negatively impact the domestic and international demand for crude oil and natural gas, which could contribute to price volatility, impact the price we receive for oil and natural gas and materially and adversely affect the demand for and marketability of our production. As the potential impact from COVID-19 is difficult to predict, the extent to which it may negatively affect our operating results or the duration of any potential business disruption is uncertain. Any potential impact will depend on future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the severity and duration of COVID-19 and the actions taken by authorities to contain it or treat its impact, all of which are beyond our control. These potential impacts, while uncertain, could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur estimates of future asset retirement obligations may vary significantly from period to period and unanticipated decommissioning costs could materially adversely affect our future financial position and results of operations.\nWe are required to record a liability for the discounted present value of our asset retirement obligations to plug and abandon inactive, non-producing wells, to remove inactive or damaged platforms, facilities and equipment, and to restore the land or seabed at the end of oil and natural gas operations. These costs are typically considerably more expensive for offshore operations as compared to most land-based operations due to increased regulatory scrutiny and the logistical issues associated with working in waters of various depths. Estimating future restoration and removal costs in the Gulf of Mexico is especially difficult because most of the removal obligations may be many years in the future, regulatory requirements are subject to change or more restrictive interpretation, and asset removal technologies are constantly evolving, which may result in additional or increased or decreased costs. As a result, we may significantly increase or decrease our estimated asset retirement obligations in future periods. For example, because we operate in the Gulf of Mexico, platforms, facilities and equipment are subject to damage or destruction as a result of hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions. The estimated costs to plug and abandon a well or dismantle a platform can change dramatically if the host platform from which the work was anticipated to be performed is damaged or toppled rather than structurally intact. Accordingly, our estimates of future asset retirement obligations could differ dramatically from what we may ultimately incur as a result of damage from a hurricane or other natural disaster. Also, a sustained lower commodity price environment may cause our non-operator partners to be unable to pay their share of costs, which may require us to pay our proportionate share of the defaulting party\u2019s share of costs.\nMoreover, the timing for pursuing restoration and removal activities has accelerated for operators in the U.S Gulf of Mexico following BSEE\u2019s issuance of an NTL in 2010 and updated in late 2018 that establishes a more stringent regimen for the timely decommissioning of what is known as \u201cidle iron,\u201d which are wells, platforms and pipelines that are no longer producing or serving exploration or support functions with respect to an operator\u2019s lease in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Pursuant to the idle iron NTL requirements, on October 3, 2019, BSEE issued us a letter, directing us to P&A numerous wells that the agency identified as no longer capable of production in paying quantities by a specified timeline of December 31, 2021. In response, we are currently evaluating the list of wells proposed as idle iron by BSEE and currently anticipate that those wells determined to be idle iron will be decommissioned by the specified timeline or at times as otherwise determined following further discussions with BSEE. While we have established AROs for well decommissioning, additional AROs, significant in amount, may be necessary to conduct P&A of the wells designated by BSEE as idle iron but we do not expect the costs to P&A these wells will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, there exists the possibility that increased decommissioning costs beyond what we established as AROs may arise and the pace for completing these activities could be adversely affected by idle iron decommissioning activities being pursued by other offshore oil and gas lessees in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico that may also have received similar BSEE directives, which could restrict the availability of salvage contractors and equipment necessary to accomplish this work. We may have to draw on funds from other sources to satisfy decommissioning costs. The use of other funds to satisfy such decommissioning costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nIn addition, we could become responsible for decommissioning liabilities related to offshore facilities we no longer own or operate. Under existing BOEM rules relating to assignment of offshore leases and other legal interests on the OCS, assignors of such interest may be held jointly and severally liable, regardless of any indemnity agreements, for decommissioning of OCS facilities existing at the time the assignment was approved by BOEM in the event that the assignee, or any subsequent assignee, is unable or unwilling to conduct required decommissioning obligations. The costs of performance of required decommissioning obligations, whether our or any assignees, may be material. Moreover, several onshore and offshore exploration and production companies have sought bankruptcy protection over the past several years. The government may seek to impose a bankrupt entity\u2019s P&A obligations on us or other predecessors-in-interest, which could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may not receive payment for a portion of our future production.\nWe may not receive payment for a portion of our future production. We attempt to diversify our sales and obtain credit protections, such as parent guarantees, from certain of our purchasers. The tightening of credit in the financial markets may make it more difficult for customers to obtain financing and, depending on the degree to which this occurs, there may be a material increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by customers. We are unable to predict what impact the financial difficulties of certain purchasers may have on our future results of operations and liquidity.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the ILX and Castex Acquisition.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the ILX and Castex Acquisition (defined below) if, among other things, we are unable to achieve the expected benefits of the transaction, or if the transaction costs related thereto and with respect to integration thereof are greater than expected. The market price also may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the ILX and Castex Acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or if the effect of the ILX and Castex Acquisition on our financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from our future acquisitions, and we may be unable to successfully integrate future acquisitions.\nOur growth strategy will, in part, rely on acquisitions. We have to plan and manage acquisitions effectively to achieve revenue growth and maintain profitability in our evolving market. We expect to grow in the future by expanding the exploitation and development of our existing assets, in addition to growing through targeted acquisitions in the Gulf of Mexico or in other basins. We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from our future acquisitions, such as increased earnings, cost savings and revenue enhancements, for various reasons, including difficulties integrating operations and personnel, higher than expected acquisition and operating costs or other difficulties, inexperience with operating in new geographic regions, unknown liabilities, inaccurate reserve estimates and fluctuations in market prices.\nIn addition, integrating acquired businesses and properties involves a number of special risks and unforeseen difficulties can arise in integrating operations and systems and in retaining and assimilating employees. These difficulties include, among other things:\n\u2022\noperating a larger organization;\n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically disparate organizations, systems and facilities;\n\u2022\nintegrating corporate, technological and administrative functions;\n\u2022\ndiverting management\u2019s attention from regular business concerns;\n\u2022\ndiverting financial resources away from existing operations;\n\u2022\nincreasing our indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nincurring potential environmental or regulatory liabilities and title problems.\nAny of these or other similar risks could lead to potential adverse short-term or long-term effects on our operating results. The process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. Members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which decreases the time they have to manage our business. If our management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer.\nAdditionally, in connection with the signing and closing of the ILX and Castex Acquisition, we have released certain estimated operating results, costs and activities, including without limitation, estimated Adjusted EBITDA and capital expenditures for the assets acquired under the ILX and Castex Acquisition. The guidance released represents our management\u2019s estimates as of the date thereof, and is based upon a number of assumptions that are inherently uncertain and is subject to numerous business, economic, competitive, financial and regulatory risks. Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control, such as declines in commodity prices and the speculative nature of estimating natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves and in projecting future rates of production. In addition, the Adjusted EBITDA estimates exclude general and administrative expenses associated with the acquired assets, which may not be representative following the integration of the acquired assets into our existing business. If any of these risks and uncertainties actually occur or the assumptions underlying our estimates are incorrect, our actual operating results, costs and activities may be materially and adversely different from our estimates.\nOur future acquisitions could expose us to potentially significant liabilities, including P&A liabilities.\nWe expect that future acquisitions will contribute to our growth. In connection with potential future acquisitions, we may only be able to perform limited due diligence.\nSuccessful acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties require an assessment of a number of factors, including estimates of recoverable reserves, the timing of recovering reserves, exploration potential, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs and potential environmental, regulatory and other liabilities, including P&A liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and may not disclose all material issues or liabilities. In connection with our assessments, we perform a review of the acquired properties. However, such a review may not reveal all existing or potential problems. In addition, our review may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities.\nThere may be threatened, contemplated, asserted or other claims against the acquired assets related to environmental, title, regulatory, tax, contract, litigation or other matters of which we are unaware, which could materially and adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations. We may be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities, including environmental liabilities, but we expect that we will generally acquire interests in properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties. In addition, even if we are able to obtain such indemnification from the sellers, these indemnification obligations usually expire over time and could potentially expose us to unindemnified liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d).\nWe are subject to the FCPA and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We may do business in the future in countries and regions in which we may face, directly or indirectly, corrupt demands by officials, tribal or insurgent organizations, or private entities. Thus, we face the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or consultants, given that these parties may not always be subject to our control. Our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and our employees and consultants may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible.\nUnder the PSCs with the CNH, we work as a consortium with our partners. Violations of the FCPA, by any consortium partner, may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the CNH has the authority to rescind the PSCs if these violations occur.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by political and economic circumstances in the countries in which we operate.\nOur oil and gas exploration, development and production activities are subject to political and economic uncertainties (including but not limited to changes, sometimes frequent or marked, in energy policies or the personnel administering them), expropriation of property, cancellation or modification of contract rights, changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies, unilateral renegotiation of contracts by governmental entities, redefinition of international boundaries or boundary disputes, foreign exchange restrictions, currency fluctuations, royalty and tax increases, and other risks arising out of governmental sovereignty over the areas in which our operations are conducted, as well as risks of loss due to acts of terrorism, piracy, disease, illegal cartel activities and other political risks, including tension and confrontations among political parties. Some of these risks may be higher in the developing countries in which we conduct our activities, namely, Mexico. Mexico\u2019s most recent presidential election was held in July 2018. Presidential reelection is not permitted in Mexico. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, took office on December 1, 2018, and his political party, Movimiento Regeneraci\u00f3n Nacional has a majority in both houses of Mexico\u2019s congress. Mr. Lopez Obrador, and certain members of his cabinet have, in the past, made statements that would call into question the degree of support their administration will have for Mexico\u2019s energy reforms. However, at this time we cannot predict what changes (if any) will result from this change in administration. Political events in Mexico could adversely affect economic conditions and/or the oil and gas industry and, by extension, our results of operations and financial position.\nOur operations may be exposed to risks of illegal cartel activities, local economic conditions, political disruption, and governmental policies that may:\n\u2022\ndisrupt our operations;\n\u2022\nrestrict the movement of funds or limit repatriation of profits;\n\u2022\nin the case of our non-U.S. operations, lead to U.S. government or international sanctions; and\n\u2022\nlimit access to markets for periods of time.\nDisruptions may occur in the future, and losses caused by these disruptions may not be covered by insurance. Consequently, our exploration, development and production activities may be substantially affected by factors that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, in the event of a dispute arising from non-U.S. operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts outside the United States or may not be successful in subjecting non-U.S. persons to the jurisdiction of courts in the United States, which could adversely affect the outcome of such dispute.\nOur operations are adversely affected by laws and policies of the jurisdictions, including Mexico, the United States, Luxembourg and other jurisdictions, in which we do business that affect foreign trade and taxation. Changes in any of these laws or policies or the implementation thereof could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nNew technologies may cause our current exploration and drilling methods to become obsolete, and we may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is subject to rapid and significant advancements in technology, including the introduction of new products and services using new technologies. As competitors use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and competitive pressures may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost. In addition, competitors may have greater financial, technical, and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and that may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We rely heavily on the use of seismic technology to identify low-risk development and exploitation opportunities and to reduce our geological risk. Seismic technology or other technologies that we may implement in the future may become obsolete. We cannot be certain that we will be able to implement technologies on a timely basis or at a cost that is acceptable to us. If we are unable to maintain technological advancements consistent with industry standards, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be in a position to control the timing of development efforts, the associated costs or the rate of production of the reserves from our non-operated properties.\nAs we carry out our drilling program, we may not serve as operator of all planned wells. We may have limited ability to exercise influence over the operations of some non-operated properties and their associated costs. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs of properties operated by others could prevent the realization of anticipated results in drilling or acquisition activities. The success and timing of development and exploitation activities on properties operated by others depends upon a number of factors that could be largely outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe availability of suitable offshore drilling rigs, drilling equipment, support vessels, production and transportation infrastructure and qualified operating personnel;\n\u2022\nthe operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources;\n\u2022\napproval of other participants in drilling wells;\n\u2022\nrisk of other non-operator\u2019s failing to pay its share of costs, which may require us to pay our proportionate share of the defaulting party\u2019s share of costs;\n\u2022\nselection of technology;\n\u2022\nthe rate of production of the reserves; and\n\u2022\nthe timing and cost of P&A operations.\nIn addition, with respect to oil and natural gas projects that we do not operate, we have limited influence over operations, including limited control over the maintenance of safety and environmental standards. The operators of those properties may, depending on the terms of the applicable joint operating agreement:\n\u2022\nrefuse to initiate exploration or development projects;\n\u2022\ninitiate exploration or development projects on a slower or faster schedule than we would prefer;\n\u2022\ndelay the pace of exploratory drilling or development; and/or\n\u2022\ndrill more wells or build more facilities on a project than we can afford, whether on a cash basis or through financing, which may limit our participation in those projects or limit the percentage of our revenues from those projects.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our anticipated exploration and development activities.\nCompetition within our industry may adversely affect our operations.\nCompetition within our industry is intense, particularly with respect to the acquisition of producing properties and undeveloped acreage. We compete with major oil and gas companies and other independent producers of varying sizes, all of which are engaged in the acquisition of properties and the exploration and development of such properties. Many of our competitors have financial resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than our budget, which may adversely affect our ability to compete. If other companies relocate to the Gulf of Mexico region, levels of competition may increase and our business could be adversely affected. In the exploration and production business, some of the larger integrated companies may be better able than we are to respond to industry changes including price fluctuations, oil and gas demand, political change and government regulations.\nWe actively compete with other companies when acquiring new leases or oil and gas properties. For example, new leases acquired from BOEM are acquired through a \u201csealed bid\u201d process and are generally awarded to the highest bidder. These additional resources can be particularly important in reviewing prospects and purchasing properties. The competitors may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low oil and gas prices, such as the current decline in oil prices, and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxation. Competitors may be able to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Competitors may also be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and exploratory prospects than we are able or willing to pay. Further, our competitors may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe impacts attaining success in the industry. If we are unable to compete successfully in these areas in the future, our future revenues and growth may be diminished or restricted.\nThe loss of our larger customers could materially reduce our revenue and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a limited number of customers that provide a substantial portion of our revenue. The loss of our larger customers, including Shell Trading (US) Company, could adversely affect our current and future revenue, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends on access to oil and natural gas processing, gathering and transportation systems and facilities.\nThe marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in large part on the operation, availability, proximity, capacity and expansion of processing, gathering and transportation facilities owned by third parties. We can provide no assurance that sufficient processing, gathering and/or transportation capacity exists or that we will be able to obtain sufficient processing, gathering and/or transportation capacity on economic terms. A lack of available capacity on processing, gathering and transportation facilities or delays in their planned expansions could result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of drilling plans for properties. A lack of availability of these facilities for an extended period of time could negatively impact our revenues. In addition, we enter into contracts for firm transportation, and any failure to renew those contracts on the same or better commercial terms could increase our costs and our exposure to the risks described above. In addition, the rates charged for processing, gathering and transportation services may increase over time.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nOur industry has lost a significant number of experienced professionals over the years due to its cyclical nature, which is attributable, among other reasons, to the volatility in commodity prices. Our operations are dependent upon key management and technical personnel. We cannot assure you that individuals will remain with us for the immediate or foreseeable future. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect on us and our operations.\nIn addition, our exploration, production and decommissioning activities require personnel with specialized skills and experience. As a result, our ability to remain productive and profitable depends upon our ability to employ and retain skilled workers. Our ability to expand operations depends in part on our ability to increase the size of our skilled labor force, including geologists and geophysicists, field operations managers and engineers, to handle all aspects of our exploration, production and decommissioning activities. The demand for skilled workers in our industry is high, and the supply is limited. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers or the unionization of our Gulf of Mexico employees could result in a reduction of our labor force, increases in the wage rates that we will have to pay, or both. If either of these events were to occur, our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired.\nResolution of litigation could materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nResolution of litigation could materially affect our financial position and results of operations. To the extent that potential exposure to liability is not covered by insurance or insurance coverage is inadequate, we may incur losses that could be material to our financial position or results of operations in future periods.\nWe have operations in multiple jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which the tax laws, their interpretation or their administration may change. As a result, our tax obligations and related filings are complex and subject to change, and our after-tax profitability could be lower than anticipated. Additionally, future tax legislative or regulatory changes in the United States, Mexico or any other jurisdiction in which we operate or have subsidiaries could result in changes to the taxation of our income and operations, which could also adversely impact our after-tax profitability.\nWe are subject to income, withholding and other taxes in the United States on a worldwide basis and in numerous state, local and foreign jurisdictions with respect to our income, operations and subsidiaries related to those jurisdictions. Our after-tax profitability could be affected by numerous factors, including the availability of tax credits, exemptions, refunds (including refunds of value added taxes) and other benefits to reduce our tax liabilities, changes in the relative amount of our earnings subject to tax in the various jurisdictions in which we operate or have subsidiaries, the potential expansion of our business into or otherwise becoming subject to tax in additional jurisdictions, changes to our existing business structure and operations, the extent of our intercompany transactions and the extent to which taxing authorities in the relevant jurisdictions respect those intercompany transactions.\nOur after-tax profitability may also be affected by changes in the relevant tax laws and tax rates, regulations, administrative practices and principles, judicial decisions, and interpretations, in each case, possibly with retroactive effect. In 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation in Public Law No. 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Additionally, the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS recently entered into force among the jurisdictions that have ratified it, although the United States has not yet entered into this convention. Both of these recent changes could result in further changes to our global taxation. Additionally, Mexico enacted tax reform legislation, and a majority of the provisions became effective on January 1, 2020, and most of the remaining provisions will become effective in the near future. These tax reforms provided for new and complex provisions that significantly change how the United States and Mexico tax entities and operations, and these provisions are subject to further legislative change and administrative guidance and interpretation, all of which may differ from our interpretation. Future tax legislative or regulatory changes in the United States, Mexico or in any other jurisdictions in which we operate now or in the future could also adversely impact our after-tax profitability.\nFinal regulations relating to and interpretations of the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may vary from our current interpretation of such legislation.\nThe U.S. federal income tax legislation enacted in Public Law No. 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, is highly complex and subject to interpretation. The presentation of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our current interpretation of the provisions contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service have issued, and are expected to continue to issue, final regulations and additional interpretive guidance with respect to the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Any significant variance of our current interpretation of such legislation from any future final regulations or interpretive guidance could result in a change to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could negatively affect our business.\nOur operations are subject to various risks that could result in increased operating costs, limit the areas in which oil and natural gas production may occur, and reduced demand for the crude oil and natural gas that we produce.\nClimate change continues to attract considerable public, governmental and scientific attention. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of GHG. These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs, and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. At the federal level, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered climate change legislation but no comprehensive climate change legislation has been adopted. The EPA, however, has adopted regulations under the existing CAA to restrict emissions of GHG. For example, the EPA imposes preconstruction and operating permit requirements on certain large stationary sources that are already potential sources of certain other significant pollutant emissions. The EPA also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions on an annual basis from specified large GHG emission sources in the United States, including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities. Federal agencies have also begun directly regulating emissions of methane, a GHG, from oil and natural gas operations as described above. Compliance with these rules could result in increased compliance costs on our operations.\nState implementation of these revised air emission standards could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay, limit or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. At the international level, there exists the United Nations-sponsored \u201cParis Agreement,\u201d which is a non-binding agreement for nations to limit their GHG emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020, although the United States has announced its withdrawal from such agreement, effective November 4, 2020.\nGovernmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in federal political risks in the United States in the form of pledges made by certain candidates seeking the office of the President of the United States in 2020. Critical declarations made by one or more presidential candidates include proposals to ban hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells and to ban new leases for production of minerals on federal properties, including onshore lands and offshore waters. Other actions to oil and natural gas production activities that could be pursued by presidential candidates may include more restrictive requirements for the establishment of pipeline infrastructure or the permitting of liquefied natural gas export facilities, as well as the rescission of the United States\u2019 withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in November 2020. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of cities, local governments and other plaintiffs have sought to bring suit against oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts. While our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\nThere are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers as stockholders and bondholders currently invested in fossil-fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Additionally, the lending practices of institutional lenders have been the subject of intensive lobbying efforts in recent years, oftentimes public in nature, by environmental activists, proponents of the international Paris Agreement, and foreign citizenry concerned about climate change not to provide funding for fossil fuel producers. Limitation of investments in and financings for fossil fuel energy companies could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of drilling programs or development or production activities.\nThe adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce or eliminate future emissions of GHG could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce or eliminate future emissions of GHG could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, political, financial and litigation risks may result in our restricting or canceling production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes, or impairing the ability to continue to operate in an economic manner.\nFinally, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHG in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods, and other climatic events. Our offshore operations are particularly at risk from severe climatic events. If any such effects of climate changes were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe enactment of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, enacted on July 21, 2010, expanded federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC and the SEC to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. Although the CFTC and the SEC have finalized certain regulations, others remain to be finalized or implemented and it is not possible at this time to predict when this is accomplished.\nIn one of its rulemaking proceedings still pending under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC issued on December 5, 2016, re-proposed rules imposing position limits for certain futures and option contracts in various commodities (including oil and gas) and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Under the proposed rules on position limits, certain types of hedging transactions are exempt from these limits on the size of positions that may be held, provided that such hedging transactions satisfy the CFTC\u2019s requirements for certain enumerated \u201cbona fide hedging\u201d transactions or positions. As these new position limit rules are not yet final, the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time.\nThe CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and the associated rules also requires us, in connection with covered derivative activities, to comply with clearing and trade-execution requirements or to take steps to qualify for an exemption to such requirements. Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception from the mandatory clearing requirements for swaps to be entered into to hedge our commercial risks, the application of the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. In addition, certain banking regulators and the CFTC have recently adopted final rules establishing minimum margin requirements for uncleared swaps. Although we expect to qualify for, and to utilize, the end-user exception from such margin requirements for swaps to be entered into to hedge our commercial risks, the application of such requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. If any of our swaps do not qualify for the commercial end-user exception, posting of collateral could impact liquidity and reduce cash available to us for capital expenditures, therefore reducing our ability to execute hedges to reduce risk and protect cash flows.\nThe full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory requirements upon our business will not be known until the regulations are fully implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has adjusted. The Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we may encounter, or reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nIn addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions have implemented and continue to implement new regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions, we may become directly subject to such regulations and in any event the global derivatives market are affected to the extent that foreign counterparties are affected by such regulations. At this time, the impact of such regulations is not clear.\nHedging transactions may limit our potential gains.\nIn order to manage our exposure to price risks in the marketing of our oil, natural gas and NGLs, we periodically enter into oil, natural gas and NGLs price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. Our hedging policy provides that we may enter into hedging arrangements covering up to the following maximum percentages of volumes: (i) 90% of the reasonably anticipated quarterly production of oil, natural gas and NGLs of PDP volumes during months January through July and November through December, (ii) 65% of the reasonably anticipated quarterly production of oil, natural gas and NGLs of PDP volumes during months August through October, (iii) 50% of the reasonably anticipated quarterly production of oil, natural gas and NGLs of our proved developed non-producing volumes during months January through July and November through December and (iv) 0% of the reasonably anticipated quarterly production of oil, natural gas and NGLs of its proved developed non-producing volumes during months August through October. These arrangements may include futures contracts on the NYMEX. While intended to reduce the effects of volatile oil and natural gas prices, such transactions, depending on the hedging instrument used, may limit our potential gains if oil and natural gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge. In addition, such transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:\n\u2022\nour production is less than expected or is shut-in for extended periods due to hurricanes or other factors;\n\u2022\nthere is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point to be assumed in the hedge arrangement;\n\u2022\nthe counterparties to our futures contracts fails to perform the contracts;\n\u2022\na sudden, unexpected event materially impacts oil or natural gas prices; or\n\u2022\nwe are unable to market our production in a manner contemplated when entering into the hedge contract.\nA majority of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments are with certain lenders or affiliates of the lenders under our Bank Credit Facility. Our derivative agreements with the lenders are secured by the security documents executed by the parties under the Bank Credit Facility. Future collateral requirements for our commodity hedging activities are uncertain and depend on the arrangements we negotiate with the counterparty and the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and market conditions.\nWe are controlled by Apollo Funds and Riverstone Funds. The interests of Apollo Funds and Riverstone Funds may differ from the interests of our other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the funds and other alternative investment vehicles managed by Apollo Management VII, L.P. and Apollo Commodities Management, L.P., with respect to Series I (\u201cApollo Funds\u201d) and entities controlled by or affiliated with Riverstone Energy Partners V, L.P. (\u201cRiverstone Funds\u201d) beneficially owned and possessed voting power over 62.9% of our common stock. At the closing of the ILX and Castex Acquisition, the Riverstone Funds received 110,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock which are subject to automatic conversion into common stock upon the terms of the Certificate of Designation. Following the closing of the ILX and Castex Acquisition, the Riverstone Funds are expected to beneficially own and possess voting power over 39.8% of our common stock. Under the Stockholders\u2019 Agreement, the Apollo Funds and the Riverstone Funds may acquire additional shares of our common stock without the approval of our Independent Directors as defined in that certain Stockholders\u2019 Agreement, dated as of May 10, 2018 (the \u201cStockholders\u2019 Agreement\u201d).\nThrough their ownership of a majority of our voting power and the provisions set forth in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Amended and Restated Bylaws and the Stockholders\u2019 Agreement, the Apollo Funds and the Riverstone Funds have the ability to designate a majority of our directors to be nominated for election by our stockholders. As a result of the Apollo Funds\u2019 and the Riverstone Funds\u2019 ownership of a majority of the voting power of our common stock, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d as defined in the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) listing rules and, therefore, we are not subject to NYSE requirements that would otherwise require us to have a majority of independent directors and nominating and compensation committees composed solely of independent directors. We have not elected to take advantage of the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemptions available to us, but we may choose to do so in the future.\nThe Apollo Funds and the Riverstone Funds also have control over all other matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including changes in capital structure, transactions requiring stockholder approval under Delaware law, and corporate governance, subject to the terms of the Stockholders\u2019 Agreement that require the Apollo Funds and the Riverstone Funds to vote in a specified manner on certain actions, including their agreement to vote in favor of director nominees not designated by the Apollo Funds and the Riverstone Funds. The Apollo Funds and the Riverstone Funds may have different interests than other holders of our common stock and may make decisions adverse to your interests.\nAmong other things, the Apollo Funds\u2019 and Riverstone Funds\u2019 control could delay, defer or prevent a sale of us that our other stockholders support, or, conversely, this control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could discourage a potential investor from seeking to acquire our common stock and, as a result, might harm the market price of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our common stock, or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nNegative publicity may adversely impact us.\nMedia coverage and public statements that insinuate improper actions by us, regardless of their factual accuracy or truthfulness, may result in negative publicity, litigation or governmental investigations by regulators. Addressing negative publicity and any resulting litigation or investigations may distract management, increase costs and divert resources. Negative publicity may have an adverse impact on our reputation and the morale of our employees, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows, growth prospects and stock price.\nThe corporate opportunity provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation could enable others to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us.\nSubject to the limitations of applicable law, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, among other things:\n\u2022permits us to enter into transactions with entities in which one or more of our officers or directors are financially or otherwise interested;\n\u2022permits the Apollo Funds, the Riverstone Funds, and any of our officers or directors who is also an officer, director, employee, managing director, or other affiliate of the Apollo Funds or the Riverstone Funds to conduct business that competes with us and to make investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments; and\n\u2022provides that if the Apollo Funds, the Riverstone Funds, or any of our officers or directors who is also an officer, director, employee, managing director or other affiliate of the Apollo Funds or the Riverstone Funds becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction or other matter (other than one expressly offered to that director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as an director or officer of us), that director or officer will have no duty to communicate or offer that opportunity to us, and will be permitted to communicate or offer that opportunity to any other entity or individual and that director or officer will not be deemed to have acted in a manner inconsistent with his or her fiduciary duty to us or our stockholders.\nThese provisions create the possibility that a corporate opportunity that would otherwise be available to us may be used for the benefit of others.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the \u201cCourt of Chancery\u201d) as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers, employees, agents or stockholders (including a beneficial owner of stock) to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and Restated Bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to the Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants in the case. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to actions arising under the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. However, Section 22 of the Securities Act provides for concurrent federal and state court jurisdiction over actions under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, subject to a limited exception for certain \u201ccovered class actions\u201d as defined in Section 16 of the Securities Act and interpreted by the courts. Accordingly, we believe that the exclusive forum provision would apply to actions arising under the Securities Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except to the extent a particular action fell within the exception for covered class actions or the exception in the certificate of incorporation described above otherwise applied to such action, which could occur if, for example, the action also involved claims under the Exchange Act. Stockholders will not be deemed, by operation of Article 12 of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation alone, to have waived claims arising under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any share of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and consent to these provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. This exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA change in the jurisdictional characterization of our FERC-jurisdictional pipelines, tribal or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of such asset, which may cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase or delay or increase the cost of expansion projects.\nSP 49 Pipeline LLC is considered a common carrier pipeline subject to regulation by FERC under ICA. The ICA requires that we maintain a tariff on file with FERC for SP 49 Pipeline LLC that sets forth the rates we charge for providing transportation service as well as the rules and regulations governing such service. The ICA requires, among other things, that the rates, terms and conditions of service on interstate common carrier pipelines be \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d and non-discriminatory. In the event a shipper protests the rates, terms or conditions of service in effect pursuant to the tariff, we may be required to modify such rates, terms, or conditions, which could adversely affect the results of our operations. With respect to CKB Petroleum, Inc., which has been granted a waiver of certain portions of the ICA and related regulations by FERC, should the pipeline\u2019s circumstances change, FERC could, either at the request of other entities or on its own initiative, assert that such pipeline no longer qualifies for a waiver. In the event that FERC were to determine that CKB Petroleum, Inc. no longer qualified for a waiver, we would likely be required to file a tariff with FERC, provide a cost justification for the transportation charge, and provide service to all potential shippers without undue discrimination. Such a change in the jurisdictional status of transportation on the CKB Petroleum, Inc. pipeline could adversely affect our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 79444, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "TALO"}
