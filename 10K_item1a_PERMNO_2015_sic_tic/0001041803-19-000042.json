{"cik": "1041803", "company": "PRICESMART INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-10-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn evaluating the Company\u2019s business, you should consider the following discussion of risk factors, in addition to other information contained in this report and in the Company\u2019s other public filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Any such risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and prospects. However, the risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and prospects.\n\ufeff\nRisks Associated with Our Business Strategy and Operations\n\ufeff\nAny failure by us to manage our widely dispersed operations could adversely affect our business.\n\ufeff\nAs of August 31, 2019, the Company had 43 warehouse clubs in operation, located in 12 countries and one U.S. territory (seven each in Colombia and Costa Rica; six in Panama; five in the Dominican Republic; four in Trinidad; three each in Guatemala and Honduras, two each in El Salvador and Nicaragua; and one each in Aruba, Barbados, Jamaica, and the United States Virgin Islands), and expects to open six new clubs in these countries in the next two years. We will need to continually evaluate the adequacy of our existing infrastructure, systems and procedures, financial controls, inventory and safety controls and make upgrades from time to time. Moreover, we will be required to continually analyze the sufficiency of our inventory distribution channels and systems and may require additional or expanded facilities in order to support our operations. We may not adequately anticipate all the changing demands that will be imposed on these systems. Any inability to effectively update our internal systems or procedures as required could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe might not identify in a timely manner or effectively respond to changes in consumer preferences for merchandise, which could adversely affect our relationship with members, demand for our products and market share.\n\ufeff\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and changes in consumer preferences for merchandise. It is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our members will demand. Failure to timely identify or respond effectively to changing consumer tastes, preferences or spending patterns could adversely affect our relationship with our members, the demand for our products and our market share. If we are not successful at predicting sales trends and adjusting purchases accordingly, we might have too much or too little inventory of certain products.\nIf we buy too much of a product, we might be required to reduce prices or otherwise liquidate the excess inventory, which could have an adverse effect on margins (net sales less merchandise costs) and operating income. If we do not have sufficient quantities of a popular product, we might lose sales and profits we otherwise could have made.\n\ufeff\nFuture sales growth depends, in part, on our ability to successfully open new warehouse clubs in our existing and new markets.\n\ufeff\nSales growth at the existing warehouse clubs can be impacted by, among other things, the physical limitations of the warehouse clubs, which restrict the amount of merchandise that can be safely stored and displayed in the warehouse clubs and the number of members that can be accommodated during business hours. As a result, sales growth will depend, in part, upon our acquiring suitable sites for additional warehouse clubs. Land for purchase or lease, or buildings to be leased, in the size and locations in those markets that would be suitable for new PriceSmart warehouse clubs may be limited in number or not be available or financially feasible. In this regard, we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations. Additionally, local land use, environmental and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouse clubs may impact our ability to find suitable locations, and increase the cost of constructing, leasing and operating our warehouse clubs. We have experienced these limitations in Colombia and in some of our other existing markets, which has negatively affected our growth rates in those markets. Limitations on the availability of appropriate sites for new warehouse clubs in the areas targeted by us could have a material adverse effect on the future growth of PriceSmart.\n\ufeff\nIn some cases, we have more than one warehouse club in a single metropolitan area, and we may open new warehouse clubs in certain areas where we already have warehouse clubs. A new warehouse club in an area already served by existing warehouse clubs may draw members away from existing warehouse clubs and adversely affect comparable store sales performance. We experienced this adverse effect on comparable sales for existing warehouse clubs recently within our Costa Rica and Dominican Republic markets when we opened one new warehouse club in each of these markets in areas that already had an existing warehouse club.\n\ufeff\nWe operate in relatively small markets. Given the growth of our sales over the past few years, market saturation could impact the rate of future sales growth.\n\ufeff\nWe might open warehouse clubs in new markets in the future. The risks associated with entering a new market include potential difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us and our lack of familiarity with local member preferences. In addition, entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large, established market presence. As a result, our new warehouse clubs might not be successful in new markets.\n\ufeff\nFailure to grow our e-commerce business through the integration of physical and digital retail or otherwise, and the cost of our increasing e-commerce investments, may materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance.\n\ufeff\nThe retail business is quickly evolving and consumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications. As a result, the portion of total consumer expenditures with all retailers and wholesale clubs occurring online and through mobile commerce applications is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate. As demonstrated by our recent acquisition of Aeropost and other ongoing investments, we are increasing our investments in e-commerce, technology and other customer initiatives. The success of our e-commerce initiative will depend in large measure on our ability to build and deliver a seamless shopping experience across the physical and digital retail channels. If we fail to successfully implement our e-commerce initiative, our market position, net sales and financial performance could be adversely affected. In addition, a greater concentration of e-commerce sales could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our warehouse clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-club sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our clubs and materially adversely affect the financial performance of the physical retail side of our operations. In addition, the cost of certain e-commerce and technology investments will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term.\n\ufeff\nOur profitability is vulnerable to cost increases.\n\ufeff\nFuture increases in costs such as the cost of merchandise, wage and benefits costs, shipping rates, freight costs, fuel costs, utilities and other store occupancy costs may reduce our profitability. We seek to adjust our product sales pricing, operate more efficiently, and increase our comparable store net sales to offset currency rate changes, changes in tax rates or in the methods used to calculate or collect taxes on our sales or income, inflation and other factors that can increase costs. We might not be able to adjust prices, operate more efficiently or increase our comparable store net sales in the future to a great enough extent to offset increased costs. Please see Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the effect of currency rate changes, inflation and other economic factors on our operations.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to risks associated with our dependence on third-party suppliers and service providers, and we have no assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new merchandise.\n\ufeff\nWe have important ongoing relationships with various third-party suppliers of services and merchandise. These include, but are not limited to, local, regional, and international merchandise suppliers, information technology suppliers, equipment suppliers, financial institutions, credit card issuers and processors, and lessors. Significant changes in the relationships or the agreements that govern the terms through which business is conducted could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have no assurances of continued supply, pricing or access to new merchandise, and any supplier could at any time change the terms upon which it sells to us or discontinue selling to us. One of our significant suppliers operates a warehouse club business and may in the future seek to compete with us in some of our markets. In addition, the manner in which we acquire merchandise, either directly from the supplier\u2019s parent company or through a local subsidiary or distributor, is subject to change from time to time based on changes initiated by the supplier and for reasons beyond our control. Significant changes or disruptions in how we acquire merchandise from these suppliers could negatively affect our access to such merchandise, as well as the cost of merchandise to us and hence our members, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nOur failure to maintain our brand and reputation could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\ufeff\nOur success depends on our ability to continue to preserve and enhance our brand and reputation. Damage to the PriceSmart brand could adversely impact merchandise club sales, diminish member trust, reduce member renewal rates and impair our ability to add new members. A failure to maintain and enhance our reputation also could lead to loss of new opportunities or employee retention and recruiting difficulties. Negative incidents, such as a data breach or product recall, can quickly erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse mainstream publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. In particular, the propagation of negative publicity on social media, whether merited or not, can have a damaging effect on our business in one or more markets. In addition, we sell many products under our private label Member\u2019s Selection brand. If we do not maintain consistent product quality of our Member\u2019s Selection products, which generally carry higher margins than national brand products carried in our warehouse clubs, our net warehouse sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected and member loyalty could be harmed.\n\ufeff\nWe face the risk of exposure to product liability claims, a product recall and adverse publicity.\n\ufeff\nIf our merchandise, such as food and prepared food products for human consumption, drugs, children's products, pet products and durable goods, do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety standards or our members\u2019 expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, increased costs, litigation or reputational harm. The sale of these items exposes us to the risk of product liability claims, a product recall and adverse publicity. We may inadvertently redistribute food products or prepare food products that are contaminated, which may result in illness, injury or death if the contaminants are not eliminated by processing at the food service or consumer level. As we begin to package and market fresh produce products within our markets, we may be exposed to additional risk of product liability and adverse publicity if those fresh food products are contaminated, which may result in illness, injury or death if the contaminants are not eliminated by processing at our packaging service centers.\n\ufeff\nWe generally seek contractual indemnification and proof of insurance from our major suppliers and carry product liability insurance for all products we sell to or package for our members. However, if we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available, product liability claims relating to products that are contaminated or otherwise harmful could have a material adverse effect on our ability to successfully market our products and on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if a product liability claim is not successful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding a product recall or any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could have a material adverse effect on our reputation with existing and potential members and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Failure to adequately maintain our systems and disruptions in our systems could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.\n\ufeff\nGiven the high number of individual transactions we have each year, we seek to maintain uninterrupted operation of our business-critical computer systems. Our computer systems, including back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes, and errors by our employees. If our computer systems and back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material interruption in our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\n\ufeff\nFrom time to time, we make technology investments to improve or replace our information processes and systems that are key to managing our business. The risk of system disruption is increased when system changes are undertaken. Targeting the wrong opportunities, failing to make the best investments or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term. These initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost.\n\ufeff\nIn 2017, we began evaluating options to replace our existing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. However, due to the rapidly evolving retail and technological landscape, as well as our recent acquisition of Aeropost, we have delayed this evaluation project in order to more holistically assess our overall IT landscape and strategy. Subsequent to that assessment, we will reconsider the need, timing, scope, and approach to our ERP replacement project. Not updating our systems on a timely basis could leave us at a disadvantage with respect to operational capabilities of our competitors. Our current ERP system is not supported by the developer of the software, which could increase the risk of a system disruption. In addition, there are newer versions available from the vendors of some of our other internal systems offering more current technology and functionality, which we have not yet implemented, and other systems which were internally developed a number of years ago which will require migration to more industry-standard technologies We are in the process of evaluating the state of all such systems and establishing a transition plan to newer technologies. If we are unable to seamlessly transition these systems, we may cause disruption in operations, member satisfaction, or sales.\n\ufeff\nBusiness acquisitions and new business initiatives could adversely impact the Company\u2019s performance.\n\ufeff\nFrom time to time we may consider acquisition opportunities and new business initiatives. During fiscal year 2018, we acquired Aeropost, Inc. (\u201cAeropost\u201d). Located in Miami, Aeropost is a cross border freight forwarding business that also operates an online marketplace. Aeropost provides logistics, payment, and e-commerce services in Latin America and the Caribbean and currently serves customers in 38 countries with Costa Rica, Trinidad and Jamaica as its largest markets. We are leveraging Aeropost\u2019s technology, its management\u2019s experience in developing software and systems for e-commerce and logistics, and its distribution and logistics systems to advance PriceSmart\u2019s development of an omni-channel shopping experience for our members. Acquisitions and new business initiatives involve certain inherent risks, including the failure to retain key personnel from an acquired business; undisclosed or subsequently arising liabilities or accounting, internal control, regulatory or compliance issues associated with an acquired business; challenges in the successful integration of operations, and alignment of standards, policies and systems; future developments that may impair the value of our purchased goodwill or intangible assets; and the potential diversion of management resources from existing operations to respond to unforeseen issues arising in the context of the integration of a new business or initiative.\n\ufeff\nFailure to attract and retain qualified employees could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\n\ufeff\nOur success depends to a significant degree on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations, merchandising and administrative personnel, and the loss of any such persons could have a material adverse effect on our business. We must attract, develop and retain a growing number of qualified employees, while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values. We compete with other retail and non-retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to adequately attract, develop and retain highly qualified employees in the future, or to replace retiring key executives which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not maintain life or disability insurance for our key executives.\n\ufeff\nExternal Factors that Could Adversely Affect Us\n\ufeff\nOur financial performance is dependent on international operations, which exposes us to various risks.\n\ufeff\nOur international operations account for nearly all of our total revenues. Our financial performance is subject to risks inherent in operating and expanding our international membership warehouse club business, which include:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nchanges in, and inconsistent enforcement of, laws and regulations, including those related to tariffs and taxes;\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of foreign and domestic governmental controls, including expropriation risks;\n\u00b7\nnatural disasters;\n\u00b7\ntrade restrictions, including import-export quotas and general restrictions on importation;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty and costs associated with international sales and the administration of an international merchandising business;\n\u00b7\ncrime and security concerns, which can adversely affect the economies of the countries in which we operate and which require us to incur additional costs to provide additional security at our warehouse clubs;\n\u00b7\npolitical instability, such as recent protests and civil unrest in Honduras, and Nicaragua and a general strike in Costa Rica led by public-sector unions that disrupted normal commerce in September 2018;\n\u00b7\nproduct registration, permitting and regulatory compliance;\n\u00b7\nvolatility in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic and business conditions; and\n\u00b7\ninterruption of our supply chain.\n\ufeff\nThese risks may result in disruption to our sales, banking transactions, operations and merchandise shipments, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nIn 2018, U.S. legislation was approved to restrict U.S. aid to Nicaragua. Additionally, during 2019, the U.S. State Department has announced varying strategies regarding if, when and how it would authorize disbursement of foreign aid, that had been previously approved by the U.S. Congress, to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Changes in U.S. policies regarding financial assistance could cause political or financial instability in the countries we serve.\n\ufeff\nNegative economic conditions could adversely impact our business in various respects.\n\ufeff\nA slowdown in the economies of one or more of the countries in which we operate or adverse changes in economic conditions affecting discretionary consumer spending, such as employment rates, business conditions, inflation, fuel and energy costs, consumer debt levels, availability of credit, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and tax rates in each of our foreign markets, could adversely affect consumer demand for the products we sell, change the mix of products we sell to a mix with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our net sales and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operating results. Factors such as declining expatriate remittances, reduced tourism and less foreign investment also could negatively impact the economies of Latin America and the Caribbean. A significant decline in the economies of the countries in which our warehouse clubs are located may lead to increased governmental ownership or regulation of the economy, higher interest rates and increased barriers to entry such as higher tariffs and taxes. The economic factors that affect our operations also may adversely affect the operations of our suppliers, which can result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing goods in the volume typically available for sale to us.\n\ufeff\nWe face significant competition.\n\ufeff\nOur international warehouse club business competes with exporters, importers, wholesalers, local retailers and trading companies in various international markets. Some of our competitors have greater resources, buying power and name recognition than we have. We also face competition from online retailers who serve our markets, and we expect that this type of competition will grow and intensify in the future.\n\ufeff\nIn the countries in which we operate, we do not currently face direct competition from U.S. membership warehouse club operators. However, we do face competition from various retail formats such as hypermarkets, supermarkets, cash and carry, home improvement centers, electronic retailers and specialty stores, including those within Latin America that are owned and operated by large U.S. and international retailers, including Walmart Inc. in Central America and Grupo \u00c9xito and Cencosud in Colombia. We have noted that certain retailers are making investments in upgrading their locations which may result in increased competition. Further, it is possible that current U.S. warehouse club operators may decide to enter our markets and compete more directly with us in a similar warehouse club format. Our ability to operate profitably in our markets, particularly small markets, may be adversely affected by the existence or entry of competing warehouse clubs or discount retailers.\n\ufeff\nOnline we compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which we sell our merchandise, merchandise selection and availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours and the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer. We may be required to implement price reductions to remain competitive if any of our competitors reduce prices in any of our markets. In response to the increasing threat associated with online retailers, we are making technology investments which may result in increases in the use of cash and reduced profitability in the near term.\n\ufeff\nOur sales could be adversely affected if one or more major international online retailers were to enter our markets or if other competitors were to offer a superior online experience.\n\ufeff\nOnline sales currently represent a small fraction of the total sales in our markets of the types of merchandise we offer, but online shopping may become more prevalent in our markets as we and our competitors begin to offer more opportunities for online shopping and as delivery systems in our markets improve. While major international online retailers have not established a significant penetration in any of our markets, it is possible that they or smaller regional companies will increase the penetration of online shopping in our markets. We continue to invest in our websites and systems with the long-term objective of offering our members a seamless multichannel experience. If we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant multichannel experience for our members, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nWe are exposed to significant weather events and other natural disaster risks that might not be adequately compensated by insurance.\n\ufeff\nOur operations are subject to volatile weather conditions and natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and volcanic activity, which are encountered periodically in the regions in which our warehouse clubs are located. Natural disasters could result in many days of lost sales at our warehouse clubs or adversely affect our distribution chain. For example, in early fiscal year 2018, operations at our USVI warehouse club were adversely affected by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. The warehouse club was closed for nine days, and after re-opening, the warehouse club operated with limited hours for 16 days due to a government-imposed curfew. Damaged and destroyed roads restricted traffic flow, adversely affecting customer access for some time after the hurricane. Future losses from business interruption may not be adequately compensated by insurance and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe face difficulties in the shipment of, and risks inherent in the importation of, merchandise to our warehouse clubs.\n\ufeff\nOur warehouse clubs typically import nearly half or more of the merchandise that they sell. This merchandise originates from various countries and is transported over long distances, over water and land, which results in:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nsubstantial lead times needed between the procurement and delivery of product, thus complicating merchandising and inventory controls;\n\u00b7\nthe possible loss of product due to theft or potential damage to, or destruction of, ships or containers delivering goods;\n\u00b7\nproduct markdowns due to the prohibitive cost of returning merchandise upon importation;\n\u00b7\nproduct registration, tariffs, customs and shipping regulation issues in the locations we ship to and from;\n\u00b7\nocean freight and duty costs; and\n\u00b7\npossible governmental restrictions on the importation of merchandise.\n\ufeff\nCivil unrest in certain countries in which we operate may adversely affect the flow of goods through those countries. For example, in September 2018, protestors in Costa Rica blocked major highways around the country and impeded access to Costa Rica\u2019s main commerce ports and fuel distribution sites. Similarly, recent political and civil unrest in Honduras and Nicaragua have involved roadblocks in many portions of these countries. Any restriction in the movement of goods through Costa Rica\u2019s ports or over Honduras and Nicaragua\u2019s highways could impair our ability to supply warehouse clubs not just in those countries, but in countries throughout the region as well.\n\ufeff\nMoreover, each country in which we operate has different governmental rules and regulations regarding the importation of foreign products. Changes to the rules and regulations governing the importation of merchandise may result in additional delays, costs or barriers in our deliveries of products to our warehouse clubs or may affect the type of products we select to import. In addition, only a limited number of transportation companies service our regions. The inability or failure of one or more key transportation companies to provide transportation services to us, any collusion among the transportation companies regarding shipping prices or terms, changes in the regulations that govern shipping tariffs or the importation of products, or any other disruption to our ability to import our merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to payment related risks.\n\ufeff\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash and checks and a select variety of credit and debit cards. We rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services, including the processing of credit and debit cards and the processing of payments to vendors. Our business could be disrupted if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. Additionally, failures or disruptions in data communication and transfer services could significantly impact our ability to transact payments to vendors and process credit and debit card transactions. We are also subject to payment card association rules and network operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change over time. If we fail to comply with these rules or transaction processing requirements, we may not be able to accept certain payment methods. In addition, if our internal systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for banks\u2019 compromised card re-issuance costs, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and/or debit card payments from our members, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nWe face the possibility of operational interruptions related to union work stoppages.\n\ufeff\nWe currently have labor unions in three of our subsidiaries (Trinidad, Barbados and Panama). A work stoppage or other limitation on operations from union or other labor-related matters could occur for any number of reasons, including as a result of disputes under existing collective bargaining agreements with labor unions or in connection with negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements. A lengthy work stoppage or significant limitation on operations could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nLegal and Compliance Risks\n\ufeff\nWe face compliance risks related to our international operations.\n\ufeff\nIn the United States and within the international markets where we operate, there are multiple laws and regulations that relate to our business and operations. These laws and regulations are subject to change, and any failure by us to effectively manage our operations and reporting obligations as required by the various laws and regulations can result in our incurring significant legal costs and fines as well as disruptions to our business and operations. Such failure could also result in investors\u2019 loss of confidence in us, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\n\ufeff\nIn foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our employees, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the laws and regulations of other countries. We maintain policies prohibiting such business practices and have in place global anti-corruption compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our employees, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies or circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Our Aeropost subsidiary operates as a freight forwarder, dealing with local customs officials in many jurisdictions in which we have not previously operated. In some countries, Aeropost operates through agents. Aeropost has been integrated into our compliance program; however, we have limited control over actions by Aeropost\u2019s agents. Any violations of anti-corruption laws, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance.\n\ufeff\nWe could be subject to additional tax liabilities or subject to reserves on the recoverability of tax receivables.\n\ufeff\nWe compute our income tax based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate. As the tax rates vary among countries, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall taxes. Changes in tax laws, increases in the enacted tax rates, adverse outcomes in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction, or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In some countries, there have been changes in the method of computing minimum tax prepayments and there are no clear rules that allow the Company to obtain refunds or to offset prepayments that are substantially in excess of the actual computed tax liability. Additionally, in one country the government alleges that there is not a clearly defined process in the laws and regulations to allow the tax authorities to refund Value Added Tax (\u201cVAT\u201d) receivables. We, together with our tax and legal advisers, are currently appealing these interpretations in court and taking other actions to recover excess taxes paid or withheld. However, if we do not prevail in these efforts, we may be required to establish a valuation reserve against these tax receivables and take an accompanying charge, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\n\ufeff\nWe file federal and state tax returns in the United States and various other tax returns in foreign jurisdictions. The preparation of these tax returns requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions, which affects the amount of tax paid by us. We, in consultation with our tax advisors, base our tax returns on interpretations that we believe to be reasonable under the prevailing circumstances. However, our tax returns are subject to routine reviews by the various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we file our returns. As part of these reviews, a taxing authority may disagree with respect to the interpretations we used to calculate our tax liability and therefore require us to pay additional taxes.\n\ufeff\nA recent example of the significant impact of taxes is the December 2017 U.S. Tax Reform. The resulting reduction in the tax rate from 35% to 21% may have a beneficial impact on the Company in the future. However, in fiscal year 2018, we incurred charges of $12.5 million due to a one time transitional tax on unremitted foreign earnings and $222,000 to reduce the value of deferred tax assets due to the reduction in U.S. tax rates. Furthermore, while the statutory tax rate decreased in the U.S., we currently do not expect to receive the full benefit of this rate reduction. This is due to the fact that we currently expect that the foreign tax credits that we can apply to our U.S. tax payable (from foreign withholdings), will exceed taxes owed at the 21% U.S. tax rate, for which our U.S. segment recorded a valuation allowance of $6.7 million for the 12 months ended August 31, 2019.\n\ufeff\nAny failure by us to maintain the security of the information that we hold relating to our company, members, employees and vendors, could damage our reputation with members, employees, vendors and others, could disrupt our operations, could cause us to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation and could materially adversely affect our operating results.\n\ufeff\nWe receive, retain, and transmit personal information about our members and employees and entrust that information to third-party business associates, including cloud service-providers that perform activities for us. We also utilize third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, cloud services, back-office support, and other functions. In addition, our online operations and our websites in our Aeropost operations and in certain of our warehouse club foreign markets depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. Each year, computer hackers, cyber terrorists, and others make numerous attempts to access the information stored in companies\u2019 information systems.\n\ufeff\nThe use of data by our business and our business associates is regulated in all of our operating countries. Privacy and information-security laws and regulations change, and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to, among other things, systems changes and the development of new processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subjected to legal risk as a result of non-compliance.\n\ufeff\nWe or our third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate one or more of the rapidly evolving and increasingly sophisticated means by which computer hackers, cyber terrorists and others may attempt to defeat our security measures or those of our third-party service providers and breach our or our third party service providers' information systems. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated. As cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more hackers, cyber terrorists or others might defeat our security measures or those of our third-party service providers in the future and obtain the personal information of members, employees and vendors that we hold or to which our third-party service providers have access, and we or our third-party service providers may not discover any security breach and loss of information for a significant period of time after the security breach occurs. We or one of our third-party service providers also may be subject to a ransomware or cyber-extortion attack, which could significantly disrupt our operations. In the enterprise context, ransomware attacks involve restricting access to computer systems or vital data until a ransom is paid. Associate error or malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities may result in a defeat of our or our third-party service providers\u2019 security measures and breach our or our third-party service providers\u2019 information systems (whether digital or otherwise).\n\ufeff\nAny breach of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers and loss of our confidential information, which could be undetected for a period of time, or any failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations, could cause us to incur significant costs to protect any members and/or employees whose personal data was compromised and to restore member and employee confidence in us and to make changes to our information systems and administrative processes to address security issues and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation with our members, employees, vendors and stockholders, as well as our operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, could result in the release to the public of confidential information about our operations and financial condition and performance and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties or liabilities. Moreover, a security breach could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the security breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures that we employ to guard such important personal information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access such information, resulting in a disruption of our operations.\n\ufeff\nA few of our stockholders own approximately 24.2% of our voting stock as of August 31, 2019, which may make it difficult to complete some corporate transactions without their support and may impede a change in control.\n\ufeff\nRobert E. Price, the Company\u2019s Chairman of the Board, and affiliates of Mr. Price, including Price Charities, Price Philanthropies, The Price Group, LLC, The Robert & Allison Price Charitable Remainder Trust and various other trusts, collectively beneficially own approximately 24.2% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Of this amount, approximately 78.0% (i.e., 18.9% of our total outstanding shares) is held by charitable entities. As a result of their beneficial ownership, these stockholders have the ability to significantly affect the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors. In addition, this ownership could discourage the acquisition of our common stock by potential investors and could have an anti-takeover effect, possibly depressing the trading price of our common stock.\n\ufeff\nFinancial and Accounting Risks\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and limits on our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars.\n\ufeff\nAs of August 31, 2019, we had a total of 43 warehouse clubs operating in 12 foreign countries and one U.S. territory, 34 of which operate under currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For fiscal year 2019, approximately 77.0% of our net merchandise sales were in foreign currencies. We may enter into additional foreign countries in the future or open additional locations in existing countries, which may increase the percentage of net merchandise sales denominated in foreign currencies, such as in the case of five of the six clubs we intend to open in fiscal 2020 and 2021.\n\ufeff\nOur consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, and to prepare those financial statements we must translate the amounts of the assets, liabilities, net sales, other revenues and expenses of our operations outside of the U.S. from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars using exchange rates for the current period. As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period may result in our consolidated financial statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, devaluing foreign local currencies compared to the U.S. dollar could negatively impact the purchasing power of our members for imported merchandise in those countries. Merchandise imported into our markets is generally purchased by the Company in U.S. dollars and priced and sold in the local currency of that country. If the local currency devalues against the U.S. dollar, we may elect to increase prices in the local currency to maintain our target margins, making the products more expensive for our members. Depending on the severity of the devaluation and corresponding price increase (as experienced in Colombia in 2015 and 2019), the demand for, and sales of, those products could be negatively impacted.\n\ufeff\nFinally, the ability of the Company to convert local currency into U.S. dollars to settle U.S. dollar invoices can be impacted in certain markets due to economic factors or government policies creating illiquidity of the local currency. This was the case in Trinidad at the end of 2016 which led us to reduce shipments from the U.S. to Trinidad to amounts that our Trinidad subsidiary could pay for using the amount of tradeable currency that could be sourced in that market, resulting in lost sales. Although the Company\u2019s ability to convert Trinidad dollars for U.S. dollars has improved, and the Company is not reducing shipments, the illiquidity of the local currency in Trinidad continues to be a risk for the Company\u2019s operations in that market.\n\ufeff\nVolatility and uncertainty regarding the currencies and economic conditions in the countries where we operate could have a material impact on our operations in future periods.\n\ufeff\nChanges in accounting standards and assumptions, projections, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, projections, estimates and judgments by our management. These include, but are not limited to assumptions, projections, estimates and judgements related to contingencies and litigation, income taxes, value added taxes, and long-lived assets. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, projections, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance. For example, because of Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-02 - Leases (Topic 842), which will be effective for the Company starting September 1, 2019, the Company is required to recognize a \u201cRight-of-Use\u201d (ROU) asset and lease liability for each of the Company\u2019s long-term leases. Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 842 requires that the ROU asset be designated as a nonmonetary asset and the lease liability as a monetary liability. Therefore, when accounting for a lease that is denominated in a foreign currency, if remeasurement into the lessee\u2019s functional currency is required, the lease liability is remeasured using the current exchange rate. We have leases in several of our subsidiaries in which the lease payments are denominated in a foreign currency that is not the functional currency of that entity. Therefore, we are subject to additional volatility in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of this accounting standard update.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 85394, "SIC": 5331, "TIC": "PSMT"}
