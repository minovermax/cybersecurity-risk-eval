{"cik": "1617227", "company": "J. Alexander's Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn connection with the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are including the following cautionary statements identifying important factors that could significantly and adversely affect the Company and cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. The risks and uncertainties described below should be considered carefully, and all information contained in this Annual Report, in evaluating the Company and its business.\nChanges in general economic conditions, including any economic downturn or continuing economic uncertainty, have adversely impacted our business and results of operations in the past and may do so again.\nPurchases at our restaurants are discretionary for consumers, and we are therefore susceptible to economic slowdowns. We believe that consumers generally are more willing to make discretionary purchases, including upscale and high-end restaurant meals, during favorable economic conditions. The most recent economic downturn, uncertainty and disruptions in the overall economy, including high unemployment, reduced access to credit and financial market volatility and unpredictability, and the related reduction in consumer confidence, negatively affected guest traffic and sales throughout our industry, including our category. If the economy experiences a new downturn or there are continued uncertainties regarding U.S. budgetary and fiscal policies, our guests, particularly price-sensitive families and couples and cost-conscious business clientele, may reduce their level of discretionary spending, impacting the frequency with which they choose to dine out or the amount they spend on meals while dining out.\nThere is also a risk that, if uncertain economic conditions persist for an extended period of time, consumers might make long-lasting changes to their discretionary spending behavior, including dining out less frequently on a more permanent basis. The ability of the U.S. economy to withstand this uncertainty is likely to be affected by many national and international factors that are beyond our control. These factors, including national, regional and local politics and economic conditions, the impact of higher gasoline prices, and reductions in disposable consumer income and consumer confidence, also affect discretionary consumer spending. Uncertainty in or a worsening of the economy, generally or in a number of our markets, and our guests\u2019 reactions to these trends could adversely affect our business and cause us to, among other things, reduce the number and frequency of new restaurant openings, close restaurants and delay our remodeling of existing locations.\nChanges in consumer dining preferences and discretionary spending patterns generally could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer preferences, national, regional or local economic conditions, demographic trends, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond quickly to these changes. Shifts in consumer preferences away from meals at our price point or our beef, seafood and signature cocktails and wine menu offerings, which are significant components of our concepts\u2019 menus and appeal, whether as a result of economic, competitive or other factors, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nMany of our restaurants are located in or adjacent to traditional commercial retail centers, and to an extent rely on elevated levels of retail area traffic in these areas during the holiday seasons. As consumer spending patterns continue to migrate to online shopping or to boutique, local shopping resources, and away from malls and other traditional commercial retail centers, these restaurant locations may be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, we place a high priority on maintaining the competitive positioning of our concepts, including the image and condition of our restaurant facilities and the quality of our guest experience. Consequently, we may need to evolve our concepts in order to compete with popular new restaurant formats or concepts that emerge from time to time, which could result in significant capital expenditures in the future for remodeling and updating. In addition, with improving product offerings, including an increased number of health-focused options at fast casual restaurants and quick-service restaurants, combined with the effects of uncertain economic conditions and other factors, consumers may choose less expensive alternatives, which could also negatively affect guest traffic at our restaurants. Any unanticipated slowdown in demand at any of our restaurants due to industry competition may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur future growth depends in part on our ability to open new restaurants and operate them profitably, and if we are unable to successfully execute this strategy, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur financial success depends in part on management\u2019s ability to execute our growth strategy. One key element of our growth strategy is opening new restaurants. However, future developments, including macroeconomic changes, could cause us to re-evaluate this growth strategy. Additionally, in the past, we have experienced delays in opening some restaurants, and that could happen again. Delays or failures in opening new restaurants and operating them profitably could materially and adversely affect our growth strategy and expected results.\nOur ability to open new restaurants on a timely basis, or at all, and operate them profitably is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nfinding quality site locations, competing effectively to obtain quality site locations and reaching acceptable agreements to lease or purchase sites;\n\u2022\ncomplying with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations and obtaining, for an acceptable cost and in a timely manner, required permits and approvals, including permits for construction, as well as required business and alcohol licenses;\n\u2022\nhaving adequate capital for construction and opening costs and efficiently managing the time and resources committed to building and opening each new restaurant;\n\u2022\nengaging and relying on third-party architects, contractors and their subcontractors responsible for building our restaurants to our specifications, on budget and within anticipated timelines;\n\u2022\ntimely hiring and training and retaining the skilled management and other employees necessary to meet staffing needs consistent with our superior professional service expectations in each local market;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully promoting our new locations and competing in their markets;\n\u2022\nacquiring food and other supplies for new restaurants from local suppliers; and\n\u2022\naddressing unanticipated problems or risks that may arise during the development or opening of a new restaurant or entering a new market.\nIt has generally been our experience that new restaurants generate operating losses while they build sales levels to maturity, with maturity typically achieved within 36 months but in certain instances it has taken considerably longer. This is due to lower sales generated by new restaurants compared to our restaurants operated in other areas, the costs associated with opening a new restaurant and higher operating costs caused by start-up and other temporary inefficiencies associated with opening new restaurants. For example, there are a number of factors which may impact the amount of time and money we commit to the construction and development of new restaurants, including landlord delays, shortages of skilled labor, labor disputes, shortages of materials, delays in obtaining necessary permits, local government regulations and weather interference. Once the restaurant is open, how quickly it achieves a desired level of profitability is impacted by many factors, including the level of market awareness and acceptance of our concepts when we enter new markets, as well as the availability of experienced, professional staff. Our business and profitability may be adversely affected if it takes longer than expected for our new restaurants to achieve the desired level of profitability.\nOur ability to successfully execute new restaurant development depends heavily on successful site selection. If a site does not produce the anticipated results, a restaurant location may never reach our desired level of profitability, if it becomes profitable at all. In those cases, we may be forced to close restaurants and will incur significant costs associated with our exit from those markets, including costs associated with lease terminations or potential losses on the sale of real property that we own. For example, in 2013, we closed restaurants in Orlando, Scottsdale and Chicago and, in January 2017, we closed a restaurant in Houston because management determined that these restaurants were not producing acceptable levels of profitability. Additionally, previously successful restaurants may cease to produce acceptable or desired results in the future due to changes within the market in which they operate, such as a geographic shift in commercial development that drives guests away from the area in which we have an existing location. In those cases, if we determine that the market is still desirable, we may choose to relocate our existing restaurant or restaurants within that same market, which could result in increased costs associated with the purchase or lease of new property.\nThe failure to successfully develop and improve our Stoney River concept to achieve operational and quality standards consistent with those of our J. Alexander\u2019s concept could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nPrior to February 2013, when the Stoney River Assets were transferred to J. Alexander\u2019s Holdings, LLC from an affiliate of FNF, Stoney River was operated by a separate restaurant company. Since that time, our focus has been on the improvement of restaurant-level operations and the integration of Stoney River into our existing infrastructure. Our growth strategy for Stoney River will continue to require significant capital expenditures and management attention. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving the desired level of profitability at Stoney River while delivering on the quality standards that we expect, and a failure to achieve the desired profitability of our Stoney River concept may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, new openings of Stoney River restaurants may take longer to achieve the desired level of profitability than has been our\nexperience with J. Alexander\u2019s restaurants. We may not be able to attract enough guests to meet targeted levels of performance at new restaurants because potential guests may be unfamiliar with Stoney River or the atmosphere or menu might not appeal to them. In addition, although we believe that the differentiation in the menu and restaurant design between our concepts is substantial enough that they can each successfully operate within the same market, opening a new Stoney River in an existing market could reduce the revenue of our existing J. Alexander\u2019s, Redlands Grill or other restaurant concepts in that market, and vice versa. If we cannot successfully execute our growth strategies for Stoney River, or if guest traffic generated by Stoney River results in a decline in guest traffic at one of our other restaurants in the same market, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nSignificant capital is required to develop new restaurants and to maintain existing restaurants and to the extent financing is available to us, it may only be available on terms that could impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us.\nWe believe that the required capital investment in our upscale restaurants is high compared to more casual dining restaurants. Failure of a new restaurant to generate satisfactory net sales and profits in relation to its investment could result in our failure to achieve the desired financial return on the restaurant. Additionally, we may require capital beyond the cash flow provided from operations in order to open new units, which may be difficult to obtain on favorable terms, if at all. The terms of any financing we may obtain could impose restrictions on our operations, development and new financings. Further, after a restaurant is opened, we continue to incur significant capital costs associated with our strategy to reinvest in our restaurants in order to maintain the highly attractive, contemporary and comfortable environment in each of our locations that we believe our guests expect. For example, in 2016, we began remodeling or completed the remodel of one J. Alexander\u2019s restaurant, two Redlands Grill restaurants and one Stoney River restaurant. The J. Alexander\u2019s / Redlands Grill remodels were routine in nature and resulted in an average cost of approximately $350 as of the fiscal year end. The one remodel at Stoney River was the first such remodel to occur at this location since the concept was contributed to us in 2013 resulting in a cost of $355 as of the fiscal year end. For 2017, we intend to complete reinvestments and improvements at our locations across all of our concepts at an approximate total cost of $7,000. Consequently, our ability to carry out our growth strategy and to execute on development and capital expenditure decisions that we believe to be in our long-term best interest could be limited by the availability of additional financing sources and could involve additional borrowing which would further increase our long-term debt and interest expense.\nOur growth, including the development and improvement of our Stoney River and Redlands Grill concepts, may strain our infrastructure and resources, which could delay the opening of new restaurants and adversely affect our ability to manage our existing restaurants.\nWe believe there are opportunities to open up to four restaurants annually beginning in 2017. Our targeted growth will increase our operating complexity and place increased demands on our management as well as our human resources, purchasing and site management teams. We also need to develop concept identity and concept awareness of our Redlands Grill concept. This may require the commitment of a significant amount of human capital and marketing expenditures. While we have committed significant resources to expanding our current restaurant management systems, financial and management controls and information systems in connection with our integration of the Stoney River concept and development of our Redland Grills concept, if this infrastructure is insufficient to support our anticipated expansion, our ability to open new restaurants and to manage our existing restaurants could be adversely affected. If we fail to continue to improve our infrastructure or if our infrastructure fails, we may be unable to implement our growth strategy or maintain current levels of operating performance in our existing restaurants.\nIf we are unable to successfully transition certain of our J. Alexander\u2019s locations to Redlands Grill locations, we may experience reduced revenue and margins at these locations, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nA key element of our business model is to pursue a multiple concept strategy consisting of the development of a number of restaurant concepts competing in the upscale casual dining segment of the restaurant industry. This is intended to, among other things, allow us to avoid being identified as a chain restaurant and to operate multiple concepts in the same market. In furtherance of this strategy, over the past two years we have developed the Redlands Grill concept and have commenced the conversion of 12 J. Alexander\u2019s restaurants into Redlands Grills. These conversions are being undertaken in markets and particular locations where we believe the Redlands Grill concept will be successful. However, we may experience a decrease in traffic, revenue or margins related to our strategy.\nIf consumer preferences change, acceptance of the Redlands Grill concept is not as strong as expected, or the existing guest base patronizing these converted locations diminishes or discontinues, revenue at these restaurants may decrease and we could be required to expend additional resources on advertising and promotion which would reduce profit margins at these locations which may have a material adverse effect on our overall financial performance.\nIf our restaurants are not able to compete successfully with other restaurants, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur industry is highly fragmented and intensely competitive with respect to price, quality of service, restaurant location, ambiance of facilities and type and quality of food. A substantial number of national and regional restaurant chains and independently owned restaurants compete with us for guests, real estate and qualified management and other restaurant staff. The principal competitors for our concepts are local, chef-driven restaurants and regional, high-quality restaurant chains in each of our local markets. However, we also compete with other upscale national chains. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources, have been in business longer, have greater name recognition and are better established in the markets where our restaurants are located or where we may expand. Additionally, in recent years many upscale and high-end restaurants have expanded into the smaller and midsize markets in which some of our restaurants are located. Our inability to compete successfully with other restaurants may harm our ability to maintain acceptable levels of revenue growth, limit or otherwise inhibit our ability to grow one or more of our concepts, or force us to close one or more of our restaurants.\nAs a result of revenue or geographic concentrations within our restaurant base, we may be more exposed to economic downturns or other disruptions in certain locations that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nAt March 15, 2017, we operated 44 restaurants in 15 states. Because of our relatively small restaurant base, unsuccessful restaurants could have a more adverse effect in relation to our financial condition and results of operations than would be the case in a restaurant company with a greater number of restaurants. For example, our J. Alexander\u2019s locations in Franklin, Tennessee and Plantation, Florida represented approximately 3.7% and 4.1% of our revenues in 2016, respectively.\nWe currently have a high concentration of J. Alexander\u2019s and Redlands Grill restaurants within the south Florida market (and in broader geographic markets, with respect to the concentration of J. Alexander\u2019s, Redlands Grill and Lyndhurst Grill restaurants in Ohio and the concentration of J. Alexander\u2019s, Redlands Grill and Stoney River restaurants in Tennessee) and may in the future have similar concentrations of restaurants within one or more overlapping markets as we execute on our growth strategy. This concentration exposes us to risks that one or more of these markets may be adversely affected by factors that are unique to that particular market, such as negative publicity, changes in consumer preferences, demographic shifts or other adverse economic impacts, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, any natural disaster, prolonged inclement weather, act of terrorism or national emergency, accident, system failure or other unforeseen event in or around regions in which we operate multiple locations could result in significant and prolonged declines in guest traffic in these geographic regions, or a temporary or permanent closing of those locations, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to increase our sales at existing restaurants or improve our margins at existing Stoney River restaurants, our profitability and overall results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAnother key aspect of our growth strategy is increasing same store sales across all restaurants and improving the restaurant-level margins at our Stoney River restaurants to the level achieved at our existing J. Alexander\u2019s and Redlands Grill restaurants. Improving same store sales and restaurant-level margins depends in part on whether we achieve revenue growth through increases in the average check or traffic counts. Our ability to improve margins at Stoney River is further impacted by the costs that we have incurred, and will continue to incur, as we strive to improve the quality standards at Stoney River to make them consistent with those at our J. Alexander\u2019s and Redlands Grill restaurants. We believe that there are opportunities to increase the average check at our restaurants through, for example, selective introduction of new profitable menu items and increases in menu pricing. However, these strategies may prove unsuccessful, especially in times of economic hardship, as guests may not order new or higher priced items. Further, we believe that part of the appeal of our concepts is the opportunity to experience outstanding, professional service and high-quality menu items at reasonable prices. Consequently, any price increases must be balanced with our desire to meet guest expectations with respect to service and quality at a reasonable value. Modest price increases generally have not adversely impacted guest traffic; however, we expect that there is a price level at which point guest traffic would be adversely affected, and these changes could cause our revenues to decrease. If we are not able to increase our sales at existing restaurants for any reason, our profitability and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIncreases in the prices of, and/or reductions in the availability of commodities, primarily beef and seafood, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur profitability is dependent in part on our ability to purchase food commodities which meet our specifications and to anticipate and react to changes in food costs and product availability. Ingredients are purchased from suppliers on terms and conditions that management believes are generally consistent with those available to similarly situated restaurant companies. Although alternative distribution sources are believed to be available for most products, increases in overall food prices, failure to perform by suppliers or distributors or limited availability of products at reasonable prices could cause our food costs to fluctuate and/or cause us to make adjustments to our menu offerings.\nBeef costs represented approximately 31% of our food and beverage costs during 2016. We currently do not purchase beef pursuant to any long-term contractual arrangements with fixed pricing or use futures contracts or other financial risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to potential price fluctuations. The beef market is particularly volatile and is subject to extreme price fluctuations due to seasonal shifts, climate conditions, the price of feed, industry demand, energy demand and other factors. We expect that beef prices in 2017 will continue to decrease relative to those prices experienced in 2016 for a significant portion of the fiscal year with the potential for such prices to flatten somewhat during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIn addition, our dependence on frequent deliveries of fresh seafood subjects us to the risk of possible shortages or interruptions in supply caused by adverse weather, environmental factors or other conditions that could adversely affect the availability and cost of such items. In the past, certain types of seafood have experienced fluctuations in availability. In addition, some types of seafood have been subject to adverse publicity due to certain levels of contamination at their source or a perceived scarcity in supply, which can adversely affect both supply and market demand. We can make no assurances that in the future either seafood contamination or inadequate supplies of seafood might not have a significant and materially adverse effect on our operating results.\nFinally, the prices of other commodities can affect our costs as well, including corn and other grains, which are ingredients we use regularly and are also used as cattle feed and therefore affect the price of beef. Additional factors beyond our control, including adverse weather and market conditions, disease and governmental food safety regulation and enforcement, may also affect food costs and product availability. Energy prices can also affect our bottom line, as increased energy prices may cause increased transportation costs for beef and other supplies, as well as increased costs for the utilities required to run each restaurant. Historically, we have passed increased commodity and other costs on to our guests by increasing the prices of our menu items. There can be no assurance that additional price increases would not affect future guest traffic. Although we believe that our integrated cost systems allows us to anticipate and quickly respond to fluctuations in commodity prices, including beef prices, if prices increase in the future and we are unable to anticipate or react to these increases, or if there are beef shortages, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nNegative customer experiences or negative publicity surrounding our restaurants or other restaurants could adversely affect sales in one or more of our restaurants and make our concepts less valuable.\nBecause we believe that our success depends significantly on our ability to provide exceptional food quality, outstanding service and an excellent overall dining experience, adverse publicity, whether or not accurate, relating to food quality, public health concerns, illness, safety, injury or government or industry findings concerning our restaurants, restaurants operated by other foodservice providers or others across the food industry supply chain could affect us more than it would other restaurants that compete primarily on price or other factors. If customers perceive or experience a reduction in our food quality, service or ambiance or in any way believe we have failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, the value and popularity of one or more of our concepts could suffer. Further, because we rely heavily on \u201cword-of-mouth,\u201d as opposed to more conventional mediums of advertisement, to establish concept recognition, our business may be more adversely affected by negative customer experiences than other upscale dining establishments, including those of our competitors.\nNegative publicity relating to the consumption of beef, seafood, chicken, produce and our other menu offerings, including in connection with food-borne illness, could result in reduced consumer demand for our menu offerings, which could reduce sales.\nShifts in consumer preferences away from the kinds of food we offer, particularly beef and seafood, whether because of dietary or other health concerns or otherwise, would make our restaurants less appealing and could reduce guest traffic and/or impose practical limits on pricing. In addition, instances of food-borne illness, such as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, which is also known as BSE or mad cow disease, as well as hepatitis A, listeria, salmonella and E. coli, whether or not found in the United States or traced directly to one of our suppliers or our restaurants, could reduce demand for our menu offerings. Any negative publicity relating to these and other health-related matters may affect consumers\u2019 perceptions of our restaurants and the food that we offer, reduce guest visits to our restaurants and negatively impact demand for our menu offerings. Adverse publicity relating to any of these matters, beef in general or other similar concerns could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nGovernmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new restaurants or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local regulations, including those relating to building and zoning requirements and those relating to the preparation and sale of food. The development and operation of restaurants depends to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations and requirements. Our restaurants are also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health, alcoholic beverage, sanitation, food and occupational safety and other agencies. In addition, stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning,\nland use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations or cause increases in development costs.\nWe are subject to the ADA and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas, including our restaurants. We may in the future have to modify restaurants by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural fixtures, for example, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons. The expenses associated with these modifications could be material.\nOur operations are also subject to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act, which governs worker health and safety, the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wages and overtime, and a variety of similar federal, state and local laws that govern these and other employment law matters. We may also be subject to lawsuits from our employees, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or others alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters, and we have been party to such matters in the past. Compliance with these laws can be costly and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation. In addition, federal, state and local proposals related to paid sick leave or similar matters could, if implemented, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or our inability to respond effectively to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and, therefore, have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with the aforementioned laws and regulations can be costly, and failure to comply can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.\nLegislation and regulations requiring the display and provision of nutritional information for our menu offerings and new information or attitudes regarding diet and health could result in changes in consumer consumption habits that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRegulations and consumer eating habits may change as a result of new information or attitudes regarding diet and health or new information regarding the adverse health effects of consuming certain menu offerings. Such changes may include federal, state and local regulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of the food and beverages we offer. The growth of our restaurant operations is dependent, in part, upon our ability to effectively respond to changes in any consumer health regulations and our ability to adapt our menu offerings to trends in food consumption. If consumer health regulations or consumer eating habits change significantly, we may choose or be required to modify or retire certain menu items, which may adversely affect the attractiveness of our restaurants to new or returning guests. We may also experience higher costs associated with the implementation of those changes. To the extent that we are unwilling or unable to respond with appropriate changes to our menu offerings, it could materially affect consumer demand and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSuch changes have also resulted in, and may continue to result in, laws and regulations requiring us to disclose the nutritional content of our food offerings, and they have resulted in, and may continue to result in, laws and regulations affecting permissible ingredients and menu offerings. For example, a number of states, counties and cities have enacted menu labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to disclose to consumers certain nutritional information, or have enacted legislation restricting the use of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. These requirements may be different or inconsistent with requirements under the PPACA, which establishes a uniform, federal requirement for certain restaurants to post nutritional information on their menus. Specifically, the PPACA requires chain restaurants with 20 or more locations operating under the same name to publish the total number of calories of standard menu items on menus and menu boards, along with a statement that puts this calorie information in the context of a total daily calorie intake. The PPACA also requires covered restaurants to provide to consumers, upon request, a written summary of detailed nutritional information for each standard menu item, and to provide a statement on menus and menu boards about the availability of this information upon request. This component of the PPACA is scheduled to become effective on May 5, 2017.\nWhile we do not anticipate that we will have more than 20 locations operating under the same name when this particular component of the PPACA becomes effective, compliance with current and future laws and regulations regarding the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items will likely be costly and time-consuming. The risks and costs associated with nutritional disclosures on our menus could also impact our operations, particularly given differences among applicable legal requirements and practices within the restaurant industry with respect to testing and disclosure, ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants, and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of nutritional information obtained from third-party suppliers.\nWe may not be able to effectively respond to changes in consumer health perceptions or to successfully implement the nutrient content disclosure requirements and to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits. The imposition of menu labeling\nlaws could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our position within the restaurant industry in general.\nCompliance with environmental laws may negatively affect our business.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning waste disposal, pollution, protection of the environment, and the presence, discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous or toxic substances. These environmental laws provide for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance and liabilities for remediation, sometimes without regard to whether the owner or operator of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of hazardous toxic substances. Third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of, or actual or alleged exposure to, such hazardous or toxic substances at, on or from our restaurants. Environmental conditions relating to releases of hazardous substances at prior, existing or future restaurant sites could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, environmental laws, and the administration, interpretation and enforcement thereof, are subject to change and may become more stringent in the future, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe effect of changes to healthcare laws in the United States may increase the number of employees who choose to participate in our healthcare plans, which may significantly increase our healthcare costs and negatively impact our financial results.\nIn 2010, the PPACA was signed into law in the United States to require healthcare coverage for many uninsured individuals and expand coverage to those already insured. As a result of the elections which took place in November 2016 and related recently proposed legislation, it appears that certain changes to the PPACA might be forthcoming, although there can be no assurances that such changes will be successfully implemented. We currently offer and subsidize a portion of comprehensive healthcare coverage, primarily for our salaried employees. Starting in 2015, the PPACA required us to offer healthcare benefits to all full-time employees (including full-time hourly employees) that meet certain minimum requirements of coverage and affordability, or face penalties. Starting in 2014, the PPACA also required most individuals to obtain coverage or face individual penalties. The amount of the individual penalty may increase significantly in future years. Accordingly, employees who are eligible for but currently elect not to participate in our healthcare plans may find it more advantageous to elect to participate in our healthcare plans. It is also possible that by making changes or failing to make changes in our healthcare plans we will become less competitive in the market for our labor. Finally, implementing the requirements of the PPACA is likely to impose additional administrative costs. The costs and other effects of new healthcare requirements did not have a significant effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in fiscal year 2016 and are not expected to significantly impact us in fiscal year 2017, but they may significantly increase our healthcare coverage costs in future periods and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to minimum wage laws and potential labor shortages could increase our labor costs substantially, which could slow our growth and adversely impact our ability to operate our restaurants.\nUnder the minimum wage laws in most jurisdictions, we are permitted to pay certain hourly employees a wage that is less than the base minimum wage for general employees because these employees receive tips as a substantial part of their income. A considerable portion of our employees earn this lower minimum wage. If cities, states or the federal government change their laws to require all employees to be paid the general employee minimum base wage regardless of supplemental tip income, our labor costs would increase substantially. In addition, any increase in the minimum wage, such as the last increase in the minimum wage on July 24, 2009 to $7.25 per hour under the Federal Minimum Wage Act of 2007, would increase our costs. Certain states in which we operate restaurants have adopted or are considering adopting minimum wage statutes that exceed the federal minimum wage as well. Any increases in federal or state minimum wages may cause us to increase the wages paid to our employees who already earn above-minimum wages in order to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. We may be unable or unwilling to increase our prices in order to pass these increased labor costs on to our guests, in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nA failure to recruit, develop and retain effective leaders, the loss or shortage of personnel with key capacities and skills, could jeopardize our ability to meet growth targets.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including restaurant managers, kitchen staff, hosts and servers necessary to meet the needs of our existing restaurants and anticipated expansion schedule, and who can meet the high standards necessary to deliver the levels of food quality, service and professionalism on which our concepts are based. Qualified individuals of the caliber and number needed to fill these positions are in short supply in some communities and competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages and provide greater benefits to attract sufficient employees. Any inability to recruit and retain qualified individuals may also delay the planned openings of new restaurants and could adversely impact our existing restaurants. Any such inability to retain or recruit qualified employees, increased costs of attracting qualified employees or delays in restaurant openings could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFurther, increases in employee turnover could have an adverse effect on food quality and guest service resulting in an adverse effect on net sales and results of operations.\nRestaurant companies, including ours, have been the target of claims and lawsuits. Proceedings of this nature, if successful, could result in our payment of substantial costs and damages.\nIn recent years, we and other restaurant companies have been subject to claims and lawsuits alleging various matters, including those that follow. Claims and lawsuits may include class action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. Similar lawsuits have been instituted from time to time alleging violations of various federal and state wage and hour laws regarding, among other things, employee meal deductions, the sharing of tips amongst certain employees, overtime eligibility of assistant managers and failure to pay for all hours worked. Insurance may not be available at all or in sufficient amounts to cover any liabilities with respect to these matters. Accordingly, if we are required to pay substantial damages and expenses as a result of these types or other lawsuits, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOccasionally, our guests file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to one of our restaurants, including actions seeking damages resulting from food-borne illness and relating to notices with respect to chemicals contained in food products required under state law. We are also subject to a variety of other claims from third parties arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims and claims alleging violations of federal and state laws. In addition, most of our restaurants are subject to state \u201cdram-shop\u201d or similar laws which generally allow a person to sue us if that person was injured by a legally intoxicated person who was wrongfully served alcoholic beverages at one of our restaurants. The restaurant industry has also been subject to a growing number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of certain of their guests. In addition, we may also be subject to lawsuits from our employees or others alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, discrimination and similar matters. A number of these lawsuits in the restaurant industry have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants.\nAdditionally, certain of our tax returns and employment practices are subject to audits by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) and various state tax authorities. Such audits could result in disputes regarding tax matters that could lead to litigation that would be costly to defend or could result in the payment of additional taxes, which could affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRegardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert resources away from our operations. In addition, they may generate negative publicity, which could reduce guest traffic and sales. Insurance may not be available at all or in sufficient amounts to cover any liabilities with respect to these or other matters. Defense costs, even for unfounded claims, or a judgment or other liability in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims or any adverse publicity resulting from claims could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur insurance policies may not provide adequate levels of coverage against all claims, and fluctuating insurance requirements and costs could negatively impact our profitability.\nWe currently maintain insurance coverage that we believe is reasonable for businesses of our size and type. However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not commercially reasonable to insure. These losses, if they occur, could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Additionally, health insurance costs in general have risen significantly across the country over the past few years and are expected to continue to increase. Obtaining insurance coverage responsive to these increases could have a negative impact on our profitability, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully offset the effect of such increases with plan modifications and cost control measures, additional operating efficiencies or the pass-through of such increased costs to our guests or employees.\nHealth concerns arising from food-related pandemics, outbreaks of flu viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe United States and other countries have experienced, or may experience in the future, outbreaks of viruses, such as norovirus, avian flu or \u201cSARS\u201d, H1N1 or \u201cswine flu\u201d or other diseases such as bovine spongiform, encephalopathy, commonly known as \u201cmad cow disease.\u201d If a virus or disease is foodborne, or perceived to be foodborne, future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availably of certain food products and cause our guests to eat less of a product, or could reduce public confidence in food handling and/or public assembly. If we change a restaurant menu in response to such concerns, we may lose guests who do not prefer the new menu, and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new guest base to produce the sales needed to make the restaurant profitable. We also may have different or additional competitors for our intended guests as a result of such a change and may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors. If a virus is transmitted by human contact, our employees or guests could become\ninfected, or could choose, or be advised, to avoid gathering in public places, any of which events could adversely affect our restaurant guest volume, and our ability to adequately staff our restaurants, receive deliveries on a timely basis or perform functions at the corporate level.\nWe occupy most of our restaurants under long-term, non-cancelable leases for which we may remain obligated to perform under even after a restaurant closes, and we may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms.\nAt March 15, 2017, we are a lessee under both ground leases (under which we lease the land and build our own restaurants on such land) and improved leases (where the lessor owns the land and the building) with respect to 26 current restaurant locations as well as two restaurant locations to be opened during 2017, two restaurants locations closed in 2013 and leased corporate office space in Nashville, Tennessee. Many of our current leases are non-cancelable and typically have terms ranging from approximately 15 to 20 years and provide for rent escalations and for one or more five-year renewal options. We are generally obligated to pay the cost of property taxes, insurance and maintenance under such leases, and certain of our leases provide for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of sales at the leased location. We believe that leases that we enter into in the future will be on substantially similar terms. If we were to close or fail to open a restaurant at a location we lease, we would generally remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, which could include, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Our obligation to continue making rental payments and fulfilling other lease obligations in respect of leases for closed or unopened restaurants could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Alternatively, at the end of the lease term and any renewal period for a restaurant, we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost, if at all. If we cannot renew such a lease we may be forced to close or relocate a restaurant, which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks. If we are required to make payments under one of our leases after a restaurant closes, or if we are unable to renew our restaurant leases, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe impact of negative economic factors, including the availability of credit, on our landlords and other retail center tenants could negatively affect our financial results.\nNegative effects on our existing and potential landlords due to any inaccessibility of credit and other unfavorable economic factors may, in turn, adversely affect our business and results of operations. If our landlords are unable to obtain financing or remain in good standing under their existing financing arrangements, they may be unable to provide construction contributions or satisfy other lease covenants to us. If any landlord files for bankruptcy protection, the landlord may be able to reject our lease in the bankruptcy proceedings. While we would have the option to retain our rights under the lease, we could not compel the landlord to perform any of its obligations and would be left with damages as our sole recourse. In addition, if our landlords are unable to obtain sufficient credit to continue to properly manage their retail sites, we may experience a drop in the level of quality of such retail centers. Our development of new restaurants may also be adversely affected by the negative financial situations of developers and potential landlords. In recent years, many landlords have delayed or cancelled development projects (as well as renovations of existing projects) due to the instability in the credit markets and declines in consumer spending, which has reduced the number of high-quality locations available that we would consider for our new restaurants. These failures may lead to reduced guest traffic and a general deterioration in the surrounding retail centers in which our restaurants are located or are proposed to be located and may contribute to lower guest traffic at our restaurants. If any of the foregoing affect any of our landlords or their other retail tenants our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nFixed rental payments account for a significant portion of our operating expenses, which increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and could limit our operating and financing flexibility.\nPayments under our operating leases account for a significant portion of our operating expenses, and we expect the new restaurants we open in the future will similarly be leased by us. Specifically, cash payments under our operating leases accounted for approximately 3.0% of our restaurant operating expenses in 2016. Our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our available cash flow to be applied to our rental obligations, thus reducing cash available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing.\nWe depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease obligations and to fulfill our other cash needs. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from borrowings under our credit facility or other sources, we may not be able to meet our operating lease obligations, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur level of indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur may limit our operational and financing flexibility and negatively impact our business.\nJ. Alexander\u2019s, LLC is currently the borrower on a Second Amended and Restated Loan Agreement with Pinnacle Bank which consists of the following loans:\n\u2022\na seven-year $15,000 mortgage loan dated September 3, 2013;\n\u2022\na five-year $20,000 development line of credit dated May 20, 2015;\n\u2022\na five-year $10,000 term loan dated May 20, 2015; and\n\u2022\na three-year $1,000 revolving line of credit dated September 3, 2016.\nOur outstanding indebtedness under these loans is $23,583 as of January 1, 2017, and $17,000 is available for borrowing under the above stated lines of credit. We may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Our credit facility, and other debt instruments we may enter into in the future, may significantly impact our business, including the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired;\n\u2022\nwe are required to use a significant portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest on our indebtedness, which will reduce the funds available to us for operations and other purposes;\n\u2022\nour level of indebtedness could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt;\n\u2022\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited; and\n\u2022\nour level of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business.\nWe expect that we will depend primarily on cash generated by our operations for funds to pay our expenses and any amounts due under our credit facility and any other indebtedness we may incur. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future and our currently anticipated growth in revenues and cash flows may not be realized, either or both of which could result in our being unable to repay indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. If we do not generate adequate resources, we may be required to refinance all or part of our then existing debt, sell assets or borrow more money, in each case on terms that may not be acceptable to us. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements, including our existing credit facility, may restrict us from adopting some or any of these alternatives. Our inability to recapitalize and incur additional debt in the future could also delay or prevent a change in control of our Company, make some transactions more difficult and impose additional financial or other covenants on us. In addition, any significant levels of indebtedness in the future could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business. Our current indebtedness and any inability to pay our debt obligations as they come due or an inability to incur additional debt could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe terms of our credit facility impose operating and financial restrictions on us.\nOur credit facility contains certain restrictions and covenants that generally limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other restricted payments to our equity holders;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nuse assets as security in other transactions;\n\u2022\nsell assets or merge with or into other companies; and\n\u2022\nsell equity or other ownership interests in our subsidiaries.\nOur credit facility may limit our ability to engage in these types of transactions even if we believed that a specific transaction would contribute to our future growth or improve our operating results. Our credit facility also requires us to achieve specified financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Specifically, these covenants require that we have a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1 and maintain a leverage ratio (adjusted debt to EBITDAR (as defined in the credit facility)) that may not exceed 4.0:1, in each case, as of the end of any fiscal quarter on a trailing four quarters basis. As of January 1, 2017, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. A breach of any of these debt covenants or our inability to comply with required financial ratios in our credit facility could result in a default under the credit facility in which case the lenders would have the right to declare all borrowings, which includes any principal amount outstanding, together with all accrued, unpaid interest and other amounts owing in respect thereof, to be immediately due and payable. If we are unable to repay all borrowings when due, whether at maturity or if declared due and payable following a default, the lenders would have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to secure the indebtedness. If we breach these covenants or fail to comply with the terms of the credit facility and the lenders accelerate the amounts outstanding under the credit facility our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur credit facility carries floating interest rates, thereby exposing us to market risk related to changes in interest rates. Accordingly, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. Assuming a 100 basis point increase on our base interest rate on our credit facility and a full drawdown on both of the revolving lines of credit, our interest expense would increase by approximately $405 over the course of 12 months. As of January 1, 2017, the balance outstanding under the $15,000 term loan was $9,583, no borrowings were outstanding under the $1,000 revolving credit facility and $4,000 in borrowings was outstanding under the $20,000 development line of credit. At January 1, 2017, we also had $10,000 outstanding under the $10,000 term loan dated May 20, 2015, which was used to refinance the remaining outstanding balance under a $20,000 related party promissory note assumed from FNFV and payable to FNF (\u201cFNF Note\u201d).\nWe depend on the services of key executives and management-level employees, and our business and growth strategy could be materially harmed if we were to lose these individuals and were unable to replace them with executives of equal experience and capabilities.\nOur success is materially dependent upon the contributions of our senior executives and management-level employees because their experience in the restaurant industry and tenure with us allow for their invaluable contributions in setting our strategic direction, day-to-day operations, and recruiting and training key personnel. The loss of the services of such key employees could adversely affect our business until a suitable replacement of equal experience and capabilities could be identified. We believe that they could not quickly be replaced with executives of equal experience and capabilities and their successors may not be as effective. See \u201cExecutive Officers.\u201d\nThe failure to enforce and maintain our intellectual property rights could enable others to use names confusingly similar to the names and marks used by our restaurants, which could adversely affect the value of our concepts.\nWe have registered the names J. Alexander\u2019s Restaurant, Redlands Grill, Stoney River Steakhouse and Grill and certain other names and logos used by our restaurants as trade names, trademarks or service marks with the PTO. The success of our business depends in part on our continued ability to utilize our existing trade names, trademarks and service marks as currently used in order to increase our restaurant concept awareness. In that regard, we believe that our trade names, trademarks and service marks are valuable assets that are critical to our success. The unauthorized use or other misappropriation of our trade names, trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our restaurant concepts and may cause a decline in our revenues and force us to incur costs related to enforcing our rights. In addition, the use of trade names, trademarks or service marks similar to ours in some markets may keep us from entering those markets. While we may take protective actions with respect to our intellectual property, these actions may not be sufficient to prevent, and we may not be aware of all incidents of, unauthorized usage or imitation by others. Any such unauthorized usage or imitation of our intellectual property, including the costs related to enforcing our rights, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nInformation technology system failures or breaches of our network security, including with respect to confidential information, could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on our computer systems and network infrastructure across our operations, including point-of-sale processing at our restaurants and integrated cost systems that are instrumental in our procurement processes and in managing our food costs. Our operations depend upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and systems against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external security breaches, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems. Any damage or failure of our computer systems or network infrastructure that causes an interruption in our operations could limit our ability to anticipate and react quickly to changing food costs and could subject us to litigation or actions by regulatory authorities. In addition, the majority of our restaurant sales are by credit or debit cards. Other restaurants and retailers have experienced security breaches in which credit and debit card information of their guests has been stolen or compromised. If this or another type of breach occurs at one of our restaurants, we may become subject to lawsuits or other proceedings for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of our guests\u2019 credit or debit card information. Although we have made significant efforts to secure our computer network and to update and maintain our systems and procedures to meet the payment card industry data security standards, our computer network could nevertheless be compromised and confidential information, such as guest credit card information, could be misappropriated. Any such claim, proceeding or action by a regulatory authority, or any adverse publicity resulting from such breaches and disruptions, or allegations of such breaches and disruptions, could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Although we maintain a cyber-risk insurance program, available coverage and policy limits may not adequately cover or compensate us in the event of a security incident.\nIf we are unable to effectively grow revenue and profitability at certain of our locations, we may be required to record impairment charges to our restaurant assets, the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe assess the potential impairment of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable. Factors considered include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner in which an asset is being used, an expectation that an asset will be disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life and significant negative industry or economic trends. We regularly review and compare the carrying value of our assets and properties, including goodwill, to the fair value of our assets and properties. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any recorded impairment to our assets. Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time we may evaluate acquisitions, joint ventures or other initiatives that could distract management from our business or have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nWe may be presented with opportunities to buy or acquire rights to other companies, businesses, restaurant concepts or assets that might be complementary or adjacent to our current strategic direction at the time and may provide growth opportunities. Any involvement in such an acquisition, merger, joint venture, alliance or divestiture may create inherent risks, including without limitation:\n\u2022\ninaccurate assessment of value, growth potential, weaknesses, liabilities, contingent or otherwise, and expected profitability of potential acquisitions or joint ventures;\n\u2022\ninability to achieve any anticipated operating synergies or economies of scale;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key personnel of any acquired business;\n\u2022\nchallenges in successfully integrating, operating and managing acquired businesses and workforce and instilling our Company\u2019s culture into new management and staff;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in aligning enterprise management systems and policies and procedures;\n\u2022\nunforeseen changes in the market and economic conditions affecting the acquired business or joint venture;\n\u2022\npossibility of impairment charges if an acquired business does not meet the performance expectations upon which the acquisition price was based; and\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention and focus from existing operations to the integration of the acquired or merged business and its personnel.\nOur business will suffer if we fail to successfully integrate acquired companies, businesses and restaurant concepts.\nIn the future, we may acquire companies, businesses, restaurant concepts and other assets. The successful integration of any companies, businesses, restaurant concepts and assets we acquire into our operations, on a cost-effective basis, can be critical to our future performance. The amount and timing of the expected benefits of any acquisition, including potential synergies, are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. The integration of acquisitions with our operations could be expensive, require significant attention from management, may impose substantial demands on our operations or other projects and may impose challenges on the combined business including, without limitation, consistencies in business standards, procedures, policies and business cultures.\nWe cannot guarantee that any acquired companies, businesses, restaurant concepts or assets will be successfully integrated with our operations in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all. Failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses or to achieve anticipated operating synergies, revenue enhancements or cost savings could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend upon frequent deliveries of food and other supplies, in most cases from a limited number of suppliers, which subjects us to the possible risks of shortages, interruptions and price fluctuations.\nOur ability to maintain consistent quality throughout our restaurants depends in part upon our ability to acquire fresh products, including beef, seafood, produce and similar items from reliable sources in accordance with our specifications. In addition, we rely on one or a limited number of suppliers for certain ingredients. This dependence on one or a limited number of suppliers, as well as the limited number of alternative suppliers of beef and quality seafood, subjects us to the possible risks of shortages, interruptions and price fluctuations in beef and seafood. If any of our suppliers is unable to obtain financing necessary to operate its business or its business is otherwise adversely affected, does not perform adequately or otherwise fails to distribute products or supplies to our restaurants, or terminates or refuses to renew any contract with us, particularly with respect to one of the suppliers on which we rely heavily for specific ingredients, we may be unable to find an alternative supplier in a short period of time or if we can, it may not be on acceptable terms. While we do not rely on any single-source supplier that we believe could not be replaced with one or more alternative suppliers without undue disruption, any delay in our ability to replace a supplier in a short period of time on acceptable terms could increase our costs or cause shortages at our restaurants that may cause us to remove certain items from a menu or increase the price of certain offerings, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to seasonal and other periodic fluctuations, and past results are not indicative of future results.\nOur net sales and net income have historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations. Net sales and operating income typically reach their highest levels during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to holiday business and the first quarter of the fiscal year due in part to the redemption of gift cards sold during the holiday season. In addition, certain of our restaurants, particularly those located in south Florida, typically experience an increase in guest traffic during the period between Thanksgiving and Easter due to an increase in population in these markets during that portion of the year.\nOur quarterly results have been and will continue to be affected by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated pre-opening costs, as well as any restaurant closures and exit-related costs and any impairments of goodwill, intangible assets and property, fixtures and equipment. As a result of these and other factors, our financial results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.\nHurricanes and other weather-related disturbances could negatively affect our net sales and results of operations.\nCertain of our restaurants are located in regions of the country which are commonly affected by hurricanes and tropical storms. Restaurant closures resulting from evacuations, damage or power or water outages caused by hurricanes, tropical storms, other natural disasters and winter weather could adversely affect our net sales and profitability. To the extent we maintain insurance policies or programs to mitigate the impact of these risks, our cash flows may be adversely impacted by delay in the receipt of proceeds under those policies or the proceeds may not fully offset any such losses.\nWe are a holding company and our only material asset is our interest in J. Alexander\u2019s Holdings, LLC, and, accordingly, we are dependent upon distributions from J. Alexander\u2019s Holdings, LLC to pay taxes and other expenses.\nWe are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of Units of J. Alexander\u2019s Holdings, LLC. We have no independent means of generating revenue. J. Alexander\u2019s Holdings, LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is not itself subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, its net taxable income is generally allocated to its members, including us, according to the membership interests each member owns. Accordingly, we incur income taxes on our proportionate share of any net taxable income of J. Alexander\u2019s Holdings, LLC and also incur expenses related to our operations. We cause J. Alexander\u2019s Holdings, LLC to distribute cash to its members, including us, in an amount at least equal to the amount necessary to cover their respective tax liabilities, if any, with respect to their allocable share of the net income of J. Alexander\u2019s Holdings, LLC and to cover dividends, if any, declared by us. To the extent that we need funds to pay our tax or other liabilities or to\nfund our operations, and J. Alexander\u2019s Holdings, LLC is restricted from making distributions to us under applicable agreements, laws or regulations or does not have sufficient cash to make these distributions, we may have to borrow funds to meet these obligations and operate our business, and our liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe could have an indemnification obligation to FNF if the Spin-off were determined not to qualify for non-recognition tax treatment, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nIf, due to a breach of any representations, covenants or undertakings made by us under the Tax Matters Agreement (as defined in the Separation and Distribution Agreement between Fidelity National Financial, Inc. and J. Alexander\u2019s Holdings, Inc., dated September 16, 2015 included as Exhibit 10.1 of Current Report on 8-K filed September 17, 2015), it were determined that the Spin-off did not qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d), we could be required to indemnify FNF for the resulting taxes and related expenses. Any such indemnification obligation could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nSection 355(e) of the Code generally creates a presumption that the Distribution would be taxable to FNF, but not to equity holders, if we or our equity holders were to engage in transactions that result in a 50% or greater change by vote or value in the ownership of our stock during the four-year period beginning on the date that begins two years before the date of the Spin-off, unless it were established that such transactions and the Spin-off were not part of a plan or series of related transactions giving effect to such a change in ownership. If the Spin-off were taxable to FNF due to such a 50% or greater change in ownership of our stock, FNF would recognize gain in an amount up to the fair market value of our common stock held by it immediately before the Spin-off, increased by the amount of the special dividend that we paid FNF in connection with the Spin-Off, and we generally would be required to indemnify FNF for the tax on such gain and any related expenses. Any such indemnification obligation could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe agreed to certain restrictions to preserve the treatment of the Spin-off as tax-free to FNF and holders of FNFV Group common stock, which will reduce our strategic and operating flexibility\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment to FNF of the Spin-off, under the Tax Matters Agreement that we entered into with FNF, we are generally prohibited, except in specified circumstances, for specified periods of up to 24 months following the Spin-off, from:\n\u2022\nissuing, redeeming or being involved in other significant acquisitions of our equity securities;\n\u2022\nvoluntarily dissolving or liquidating;\n\u2022\ntransferring significant amounts of our assets;\n\u2022\namending our certificate of incorporation or by-laws;\n\u2022\nfailing to engage in the active conduct of a trade or business; or\n\u2022\nengaging in certain other actions or transactions that could jeopardize the tax-free status of the Spin-off.\nThese covenants and restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new businesses or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business, and might discourage or delay a strategic transaction that our equity holders may consider favorable.\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Spin-off.\nWe believe that, as an independent publicly-traded company, we are able to, among other things, better focus our financial and operational resources on our specific business, implement and maintain a capital structure designed to meet our specific needs, design and implement corporate strategies and policies that are targeted to our business, more effectively respond to industry dynamics and create effective incentives for our management and employees that are more closely tied to our business performance. However, by separating from FNF, we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events. In addition, we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company in the time we expect, if at all. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn connection with the Spin-off, we and FNF undertook potentially significant indemnity obligations. If we are required to perform under these indemnities to FNF, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In the case of FNF\u2019s indemnity, there can be no assurance that the indemnity will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of any relevant liabilities or that FNF will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.\nUnder the Tax Matters Agreement that we entered into with FNF, we generally agreed to indemnify FNF for taxes and related losses it suffers as a result of the Spin-off failing to qualify as a tax-free transaction, if the taxes and related losses are attributable to: direct or indirect acquisitions of our stock or assets (regardless of whether we consent to such acquisitions); negotiations, understandings, agreements or arrangements in respect of such acquisitions; or our failure to comply with certain representations and undertakings from us, including the restrictions described in the preceding risk factor. Our indemnity obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement covers both corporate level taxes and related losses imposed on FNF in the event of a 50% or greater change in our stock ownership described in the preceding risk factor, as well as taxes and related losses imposed on FNF if, due to our representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated, the Spin-off is determined to be taxable for other reasons.\nUnder the Separation and Distribution Agreement we have agreed to indemnify FNF and its representatives against losses suffered as a result of, among other things: our failure to promptly pay or discharge any of our liabilities following the Spin-off; any breach by us of the Separation and Distribution Agreement; and any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or material omission or material alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated in the registration statement filed in connection with the Spin-off.\nIndemnities that we may be required to provide FNF may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, particularly indemnities relating to certain actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the Spin-off. Despite the Tax Matters Agreement providing to the contrary, third-parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that FNF has agreed to retain. Further, there can be no assurance that the indemnity from FNF will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that FNF will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from FNF any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe continued ownership of FNF common stock and FNFV Group common stock by some of our directors may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest.\nBecause of their current or former positions with FNF, certain of our non-employee directors own FNF common stock and FNFV Group common stock. These holdings in FNF common stock and FNFV Group common stock may be significant for some of these persons compared to that person\u2019s total assets. Even though our Board includes directors who are independent from both FNF and our Company under the applicable rules of the SEC and New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d), ownership of FNF common stock and FNFV Group common stock by our directors and officers after the separation may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for FNF than they do for us. In addition, some of our directors are members of the Board of Directors of FNFV Group subsidiaries which may in the future create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interests.\nWe could have potentially received better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we received in our agreements with FNF and its affiliates.\nThe agreements we entered into with FNF or its affiliates in connection with the separation consist of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement and the Management Consulting Agreement, each of which were negotiated in the context of the separation while we were still a majority-owned subsidiary of FNF. Accordingly, during the period in which the terms of those agreements were negotiated, we did not have an independent board of directors or a management team independent of FNF. As a result, the terms of those agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm\u2019s-length negotiations between unaffiliated third-parties. The terms of the agreements negotiated in the context of the separation relate to, among other things, the consideration to be paid to Black Knight Advisory Services, LLC for management services under the Management Consulting Agreement. Arm\u2019s-length negotiations between FNF and an unaffiliated third party in another form of transaction, such as a buyer in a sale of a business transaction, may have resulted in more favorable terms to us.\nUnder our Management Consulting Agreement with Black Knight Advisory Services, LLC, we have agreed to pay cash compensation equal to 3% of our annual Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d) which could result in significant increases in management fees and our expenses.\nUnder our Management Consulting Agreement with Black Knight Advisory Services, LLC (\u201cBlack Knight\u201d or \u201cManagement Consultant\u201d), we have agreed to pay 3% of our annual Adjusted EBITDA to the Management Consultant in consideration for management consulting services. As we continue to execute our business plan and grow our concepts, we expect to generate increased Adjusted EBITDA which would result in automatic increases in the amounts payable to the Management Consultant under the Management Consulting Agreement. We have also issued Class B Units to the Management Consultant reflecting profits interest in J. Alexander\u2019s Holdings, LLC. Although these arrangements are designed to align the interests of the Management Consultant with our public shareholders, the compensation payable to the Management Consultant could be substantial\nas we generate increased levels of Adjusted EBITDA. In such circumstances, the amount of profits allocable to our shareholders and the amount of cash flow otherwise available to us for other corporate purposes, including dividends or other distributions to our shareholders, would be reduced.\nThe issuance of common stock upon exchange of Class B Units may dilute our shareholders\u2019 ownership of common stock.\nThe Class B Units of J. Alexander\u2019s Holdings, LLC held by members of our management are exchangeable for, at our option, either shares of our common stock or a cash payment from J. Alexander\u2019s Holdings, LLC, and the Class B Units held by the Management Consultant are exchangeable only for shares of common stock, as described under Note 14 - Share-based Compensation and Note 18 - Related Party Transactions in the footnotes to our Consolidated Financial Statements found under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report. If we elect to issue common stock in respect of these exchanges, investor ownership of common stock will be diluted.\nIf we elect to have J. Alexander\u2019s Holdings, LLC make cash payments for future exchanges of Class B Units in lieu of issuing shares of common stock, such payments may reduce the amount of overall cash flow that would otherwise be available to us.\nIf we elect to have J. Alexander\u2019s Holdings, LLC make cash payments in lieu of issuing shares of common stock upon exchanges of Class B Units made by members of our management, such payments may require the payment of significant amounts of cash and may reduce the amount of overall cash flow that would otherwise be available for distribution to us from J. Alexander\u2019s Holdings, LLC. In such event, our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy may be negatively affected.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline due to significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to seasonality and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, resulting in a decline in our stock price. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of several factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses;\n\u2022\nrestaurant operating expenses for our newly-opened restaurants, which are often materially greater during the first several quarters of operation than thereafter;\n\u2022\nlabor availability and costs for hourly and management personnel;\n\u2022\nprofitability of our restaurants, especially in new markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u2022\nincreases and decreases in same store sales;\n\u2022\nimpairment of long-lived assets and any loss on restaurant closures;\n\u2022\nmacroeconomic conditions, both nationally and locally;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity relating to the consumption of beef, poultry, seafood or other products we serve;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer preferences and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nexpansion to new markets;\n\u2022\nincreases in infrastructure costs; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in commodity prices.\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to December 31 and generally contains 52 weeks. As a result of this format, we will periodically have a fiscal year which contains 53 weeks of operation, including a 14-week fourth quarter. Fiscal year 2015 represents such a year.\nSeasonal factors and the timing of holidays also cause our revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Net sales and operating income typically reach their highest levels during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to holiday business and the first quarter of the fiscal year due in part to the redemption of gift cards sold during the holiday season. As a result of these factors, our quarterly and annual operating results and same store sales may fluctuate significantly. Accordingly, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year, and same store sales for any particular future period may decrease. In the future, operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the price of our common stock would likely decrease.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and stockholders may not be able to sell shares at an acceptable price.\nThe market price of our stock could fluctuate significantly, and stockholders may not be able to resell shares at an acceptable price. Those fluctuations could be based on various factors in addition to those otherwise described in this Annual Report, including those described under Item 1A. Risk Factors and the following:\n\u2022\nour operating performance and the performance of our competitors or restaurant companies in general and fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who follow us or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nglobal, national or local economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new locations or menu items, capacity changes, strategic investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our or our competitors\u2019 operating results, and our or our competitors\u2019 growth rates;\n\u2022\nfailure by us or our competitors to meet analysts\u2019 projections or guidance that we or our competitors may give the market;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations, or new interpretations or applications of laws and regulations, that are applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nthe arrival or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe number of shares being publicly traded;\n\u2022\nfuture sales or issuances of our common stock, including sales or issuances by us, our officers or directors and our significant shareholders; and\n\u2022\nother developments affecting us, our industry or our competitors.\nIn addition, in recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and restaurant industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions or interest rate changes, may cause declines in the market price of our common stock.\nAs we operate in a single industry, we are especially vulnerable to these factors to the extent that they affect our industry or our products. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, and could also require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline due to the number of shares of common stock eligible for future sale upon the exchange of Class B Units.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of issuances of additional shares of our common stock eligible for future sale upon the exchange of Class B Units, or the perception that such issuances could occur. These issuances, or the possibility that these issuances may occur, may also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling equity securities in the future, at a time and price that we deem appropriate. Approximately 13.5% of the ownership interests in J. Alexander\u2019s Holdings, LLC are Class B Units held by certain members of our management and the Management Consultant. Based on the value of J. Alexander\u2019s Holdings, LLC (determined primarily by reference to the trading price of our common stock) above a specified hurdle amount and time-based vesting provisions, vested Class B Units may be immediately exchanged for our common stock or, for those held by members of our management, for cash, at our option. We will not know the exact number of shares of common stock issuable until an exchange right is exercised. The earliest date we expect an exchange right could be exercised would be in the second quarter of 2017.\nOur charter and bylaws and provisions of Tennessee law may discourage or prevent strategic transactions, including a takeover of our company, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our shareholders.\nProvisions contained in our charter and bylaws and provisions of the Tennessee Business Corporation Act could delay or prevent a third party from entering into a strategic transaction with us, as applicable, even if such a transaction would benefit our shareholders. For example, our charter and bylaws:\n\u2022\ndivide our board of directors into three classes with staggered three-year terms, which may delay or prevent a change of our management or a change in control;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by us upon approval of our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares of capital stock, making a takeover more difficult and expensive;\n\u2022\ndo not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which could otherwise make it easier for a smaller minority of shareholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\ndo not permit shareholders to take action upon less than unanimous written consent;\n\u2022\nprovide that special meetings of the shareholders may be called only by or at the direction of the board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors or the chief executive officer;\n\u2022\nrequire advance notice to be given by shareholders for any shareholder proposals or director nominees;\n\u2022\nrequire a super-majority vote of the shareholders to amend certain provisions of our charter; and\n\u2022\nallow our board of directors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws but only allow shareholders to amend or repeal our bylaws upon the approval of 66 2/3 % or more of the voting power of all of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote.\nIn addition, we are subject to certain provisions of Tennessee law that limit, in some cases, our ability to engage in certain business combinations with significant shareholders.\nThese restrictions and provisions could keep us from pursuing relationships with strategic partners and from raising additional capital, which could impede our ability to expand our business and strengthen our competitive position. These restrictions could also limit shareholder value by impeding a sale of us or J. Alexander\u2019s Holdings, LLC.\nUnder the Tax Matters Agreement that we entered into with FNF, we are generally prohibited, except in specified circumstances, for specified periods of up to 24 months following the Spin-off from consenting to certain acquisitions of significant amounts of our stock.\nAs discussed above, an acquisition or further issuance of our equity securities could trigger a tax to FNF, requiring us under the Tax Matters Agreement to indemnify FNF for such tax. This indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that might otherwise be considered favorable.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If too few securities or industry analysts cover our stock, the trading price for our common stock could be negatively impacted. If an analyst downgrades our common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If an analyst ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which could cause our stock prices and trading volume to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe may retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any future determination to declare and pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. In addition, our current credit facility restricts our ability to pay dividends. Our ability to pay dividends may also be limited by covenants of any future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. As a result, investors may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless investors sell our common stock for a price greater than that which the investor paid for it.\nWe will incur increased costs as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public, exchange listed company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company as defined under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). In addition, new and changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations promulgated and to be promulgated thereunder, as well as under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d), and the JOBS Act, have created uncertainty for public companies and increased costs and time that boards of directors and management must devote to complying with these rules and regulations. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules of the SEC and the NYSE regulate corporate governance practices of public companies. We expect compliance with these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and lead to a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities. For example, we have adopted new internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional expenses associated with our SEC reporting requirements. We currently estimate that the additional costs we incur as a result of being a public company are approximately $1,200 annually.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles applicable to us.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. In addition, the SEC has announced a multi-year plan that could ultimately lead to the use of International Financial Reporting Standards by U.S. issuers in their SEC filings. Any such change could have a significant effect on our reported financial results.\nWe are an emerging growth company and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company as defined under the JOBS Act, and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies, but not to emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, reduced disclosure about executive compensation arrangements pursuant to the rules applicable to smaller reporting companies and no requirement to seek non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. We have elected to adopt these reduced disclosure requirements. We may take advantage of these provisions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), (2) the last day our first fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period and (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our prior second fiscal quarter.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we are choosing to \u201copt out\u201d of such extended transition period and, as a result, we will comply\nwith new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our choices, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIf we are unable to implement and maintain the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to provide an unqualified report on our internal controls, which could adversely affect our stock price.\nPursuant to Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley and the related rules adopted by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, starting with the second annual report that we file with the SEC, our management will be required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, once we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act and lose the ability to rely on the exemptions related thereto discussed above, our independent registered public accounting firm will also need to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404. We may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any changes necessary to our internal control over financial reporting to conclude such controls are effective. If we conclude and, once we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm concludes, that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, investor confidence and our stock price could decline.\nMatters impacting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions by the SEC or violations of NYSE rules, and result in a breach of the covenants under our financing arrangements. There also could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements also could suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. This could materially adversely affect us and lead to a decline in the price of our common stock.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur charter and bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Tennessee law. In addition, we have entered and expect to continue to enter into agreements to indemnify our directors, executive officers and other employees as determined by our board of directors. Under the terms of such indemnification agreements, we are required to indemnify each of our directors and officers, to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Tennessee, if the basis of the indemnitee\u2019s involvement was by reason of the fact that the indemnitee is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or was serving at the Company\u2019s request in an official capacity for another entity. We must indemnify our officers and directors against all reasonable fees, expenses, charges and other costs of any type or nature whatsoever, including any and all expenses and obligations paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in, participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to defend, be a witness or participate in any completed, actual, pending or threatened action, suit, claim or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, or establishing or enforcing a right to indemnification under the indemnification agreement. The indemnification agreements also require us, if so requested, to advance within 30 days of such request all reasonable fees, expenses, charges and other costs that such director or officer incurred, provided that such person will return any such advance if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification by us. Any claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nFuture offerings of debt securities, which would rank senior to our common stock upon our bankruptcy or liquidation, and future offerings of equity securities that may be senior to our common stock for the purposes of dividend and liquidating distributions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making offerings of debt securities or additional offerings of equity securities. Upon bankruptcy or liquidation, holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both, and may result in future limitations under the tax code that could reduce the rate at which we utilize any net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our taxable income. Preferred stock, if issued, could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments or both that could limit our ability to make a dividend distribution to the holders of our common stock. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control and may have\nthe effect of reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the ownership interest of existing stockholders in J. Alexander Holdings, Inc.", "PERMNO": 66747, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "JAX"}
