{"cik": "1253317", "company": "OLD LINE BANCSHARES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should consider carefully the following risks, along with other information contained in this Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that may affect us. Additional risks and uncertainties also may adversely affect our business and operations including those discussed in Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Any of the following events, should they actually occur, could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nSystem failure or cybersecurity breaches of our network security could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other potential losses. We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. The computer systems and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to unforeseen hardware and cybersecurity issues. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect the computer systems and network infrastructure we use, including our Internet banking activities, against damage from physical break-ins, cybersecurity breaches and other disruptive problems caused by the Internet or other users. Such computer break-ins and other disruptions would jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure, which may result in significant liability to us, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customers, and inhibit current and potential customers from our Internet banking services, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Each year, we add additional security measures to our computer systems and network infrastructure to mitigate the possibility of cybersecurity breaches including firewalls and penetration testing, but there can be no assurance that such security measures will be effective in preventing such breaches, damage or failures. We continue to monitor developments in this area and consider whether additional protective measures are necessary or appropriate, and we have obtained insurance protection intended to cover losses due to network security breaches; there is no guarantee, however, that such insurance, would cover all costs associated with any breach, damage or failure of our computer systems and network infrastructure.\nWe rely on certain external vendors. Our business is dependent on the use of outside service providers that support our day-to-day operations including data processing and electronic communications. Our operations are exposed to risk that a service provider may not perform in accordance with established performance standards required in our agreements for any number of reasons including equipment or network failure, a change in their senior management, their financial condition, their product line or mix and how they support existing customers, or a simple change in their strategic focus. While we have comprehensive policies and procedures in place to mitigate risk at all phases of service provider management from selection, to performance monitoring and renewals, the failure of a service provider to perform in accordance with contractual agreements could be disruptive to our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions and results of our operations.\nA worsening of current economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in prevailing economic conditions, including declining real estate values, changes in interest rates that may cause a decrease in interest rate spreads, adverse employment conditions, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and other significant external events may adversely affect our financial results. Although the U.S. economy has emerged from the severe recession that occurred in 2007 through 2009, economic growth has been slow and\nuneven, and employment growth remains weak. Recovery by many businesses has been impaired by lower consumer spending. A return to prolonged deteriorating economic conditions could significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Although signs of stability have emerged, we expect that the business environment in the State of Maryland and the entire United States will continue to present challenges for the foreseeable future. Further continuing economic uncertainty, including regarding concerns about U.S. debt levels and related governmental actions, including potential tax increases and cuts in government spending, may hamper the ongoing recovery or otherwise negatively impact economic conditions going forward. In addition, an increase in unemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies, increases in our nonperforming and criticized classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services. These events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough the adverse economic climate during the past several years has not severely impacted us due to our strict underwriting standards, any adverse changes in the economy going forward, including decreases in current real estate values, increased unemployment or the economy moving back into a recession, could have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings.\nA worsening of credit markets and economic conditions could adversely affect our liquidity. Old Line Bank must maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure cash flow is available to satisfy current and future financial obligations including demand for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding of operating costs and other corporate purposes. We obtain funding through deposits and various short term and long term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased, unsecured borrowings, brokered certificates of deposits and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and others. Economic uncertainty and disruptions in the financial system may adversely affect our liquidity. Dramatic declines in the housing market and falling real estate prices coupled with increased foreclosures and unemployment, resulted in significant asset value write downs by financial institutions during and after the recent recession, including government sponsored entities and investment banks. These investment write downs have caused financial institutions to seek additional capital. Should we experience a substantial deterioration in our financial condition or should disruptions in the financial markets restrict our funding, it would negatively impact our liquidity. To mitigate this risk, we closely monitor our liquidity and maintain a line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank and have received approval to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.\nOur concentrations of loans in various categories may also increase the risk of credit losses. We currently invest more than 25% of our capital in various loan types and industry segments, including commercial real estate loans and loans to the hospitality industry (hotels/motels). While declines in the local commercial real estate market following the most recent recession have not caused the collateral securing our loans to exceed acceptable loan to value ratios, a deterioration in the commercial real estate market could cause deterioration in the collateral securing these loans and/or a decline in our customers\u2019 earning capacity. This could negatively impact us. Although we have made a large portion of our hospitality loans to long term, well established operators in strategic locations, a decline in the occupancy rate in these facilities could negatively impact their earnings. This could adversely impact their ability to repay their loan, which would adversely impact our net income.\nOur need to comply with extensive and complex governmental regulation could have an adverse effect on our business and our growth strategy. The banking industry is subject to extensive regulation by state and federal banking authorities. Many of these regulations are intended to protect depositors, the public or the FDIC insurance funds, not stockholders. Regulatory requirements affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, ability to attract and retain personnel and many other aspects of our business. These requirements may constrain our rate of growth and changes in regulations could adversely affect us. The cost of compliance with regulatory requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. Further, if we are not in compliance with such requirements, we could be subject to fines or other regulatory action that could restrict our ability to operate or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Although we believe we are material compliance with all applicable regulations, it is possible there are violations of which we are unaware that could be discovered by our regulators in the course of an examination or otherwise, which could trigger such fines or other adverse consequences.\nIn addition, because federal regulation of financial institutions changes regularly and is the subject of constant legislative debate, we cannot forecast how federal regulation of financial institutions may change in the future and impact\nour operations. In light of the performance of and government intervention in the financial sector, there will be significant changes to the banking and financial institutions\u2019 regulatory agencies in the future. Changes in regulation and oversight, including in the form of changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect the service and products we offer, increase our operating expenses, increase compliance challenges and otherwise adversely impact our financial performance and condition. In addition, the burden imposed by these federal and state regulations may place banks in general, and Old Line Bank specifically, at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors.\nThe Capital rules that were issued require insured depository institutions and their holding companies to hold more capital. The impact of the new rules on our financial condition and operations is uncertain but could be materially adverse. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule for the Basel III capital framework. These rules substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to us. The rules phase in over a period of time beginning in 2015 and will become fully effective in 2019. The rules apply to the Company as well as to the Bank. Beginning in 2015, our minimum capital requirements will be (i) a common Tier 1 equity ratio of 4.5%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital (common Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) of 6% (up from 4%) and (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (the current requirement). Our leverage ratio requirement will remain at the 4% level now required. Beginning in 2016, a capital conservation buffer will phase in over three years, ultimately resulting in a requirement of 2.5% on top of the common Tier 1, Tier 1 and total capital requirements, resulting in a required common Tier 1 equity ratio of 7%, a Tier 1 ratio of 8.5%, and a total capital ratio of 10.5%. Failure to satisfy any of these three capital requirements will result in limits on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.\nRegulations pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act may adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the U.S. financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFPB and other federal agencies to implement many new and significant rules and regulations to implement its various provisions. There are a number of regulations under the Dodd-Frank act that have not yet been proposed or adopted. We will not know the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business until regulations implementing the statute are adopted and implemented, which could be years. As a result, we cannot predict the full extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act will impact our business, operations or financial condition. However, compliance with these new laws and regulations may require us to make changes to our business and operations and will likely result in additional costs and a diversion of management\u2019s time from other business activities, any of which may adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.\nBecause we serve a limited market area in Maryland, an economic downturn in our market area could more adversely affect us than it affects our larger competitors that are more geographically diverse. Our current primary market area consists of the suburban Maryland (Washington, D.C. suburbs) Counties of Anne Arundel, Calvert, Charles, Montgomery, Prince George\u2019s and St. Mary\u2019s. We may expand in contiguous northern and western Counties, such as Howard County, Maryland. However, broad geographic diversification is not currently part of our community bank focus. Overall, during and following the most recent recession, the business environment has negatively impacted many businesses and households in the United States and worldwide. Although the economic decline has not impacted the suburban Maryland and Washington D.C. suburbs as adversely as other areas of the United States, it has caused an increase in unemployment and business failures and a decline in property values. As a result, if our market area should suffer another economic downturn, it may more severely affect our business and financial condition than it affects larger bank competitors. In particular, due to the proximity of our primary market area to Washington, D.C., decreases in spending by the Federal government could impact us more than banks that serve a larger or a different geographical area. Our larger competitors, for example, serve more geographically diverse market areas, parts of which may not be affected by the same economic conditions that may exist in our market area. Further, unexpected changes in the national and local economy may adversely affect our ability to attract deposits and to make loans. Such risks are beyond our control and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, the value of our securities.\nWe originate and retain in our portfolio residential mortgage loans. A downturn in the local real estate market and economy could adversely affect earnings. Our loan portfolio includes residential mortgage loans that we originate. Although the local real estate market and economy in our primary market areas have performed better than many other\nmarkets, a downturn could cause higher unemployment, more delinquencies, and could adversely affect the value of properties securing loans. In addition, the real estate market may take longer to recover or not recover to previous levels. These risks increase the probability of an adverse impact on our financial results as fewer borrowers would be eligible to borrow and property values could be below necessary levels required for adequate coverage on the requested loan.\nWe may not have adequately assessed the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities. Current accounting guidance requires that we record assets and liabilities at their estimated fair values on the purchase date. The determination of fair value requires that we consider a number of factors including the remaining life of the acquired loans and deposits, estimated prepayments or withdrawals, estimated loss ratios, estimated value of the underlying collateral, and the net present value of expected cash flows. Actual deviations from these predicted cash flows, maturities or repayments or the underlying value of the collateral may mean that our present value determination is inaccurate. This may cause fluctuations in interest income, non-interest income, provision expense, interest expense and non-interest expense and negatively impact our results of operations.\nNew regulations restrict our ability to originate residential real estate loans. A CFPB rule, effective January 10, 2014, is designed to clarify for lenders how they can avoid legal liability under the Dodd-Frank Act, which would otherwise hold lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a mortgage. Loans that meet this \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d definition set forth in the rule will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. Under the rule, a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d loan must not contain certain specified features.\nThe rule also establishes general underwriting criteria for qualified mortgages, including that the consumer must have a total (or \u201cback end\u201d) debt-to-income ratio that is less than or equal to 43%. Lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrower on the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments. The CFPB\u2019s rule on qualified mortgages limits our ability to make residential mortgage loans that include a balloon payment, and may cause us to decide to limit certain types of other loans or loans to certain borrowers, and would make it more costly and/or or time consuming to make these loans, which could limit our growth or profitability.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the regulatory agencies to issue regulations that require securitizers of loans to retain \u201cnot less than 5% of the credit risk for any asset that is not a qualified residential mortgage.\u201d The regulatory agencies issued a final rule to implement this requirement on October 21, 2014. The final rule aligns the definition of \u201cqualified residential mortgage\u201d with the definition of \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d issued by the CFPB for purposes of its regulations.. The final rule is effective February 23, 2015. Compliance with the final rule is required beginning December 24, 2015 with respect to asset-backed securities collateralized by residential mortgages, and beginning December 24, 2016 with respect to all other classes of asset-backed securities,. The final rule could have a significant effect on the secondary market for loans and the types of loans we originate, and restrict our ability to make loans.\nWe depend on the services of key personnel. The loss of any of these personnel could disrupt our operations and our business could suffer. Our success depends substantially on the skills and abilities of our executive management team, including James W. Cornelsen, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Joseph E. Burnett, our Executive Vice President and Chief Lending Officer, John Miller, our Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, and Mark A. Semanie, our Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer. Although we have entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Cornelsen, Burnett, Miller and Semanie, the existence of such agreements does not assure that we will retain their services. These executives provide valuable services to us and would be difficult to replace.\nAlso, our growth and success and our anticipated future growth and success, in a large part, is due and we anticipate will be due to the relationships maintained by our banking executives with our customers. The loss of services of one or more of these executives or of other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our business could suffer. The experienced commercial lenders that we have hired are not a party to any employment agreement with us and they could terminate their employment with us at any time and for any reason.\nOur growth and expansion strategy may not be successful. Our ability to grow depends upon our ability to attract new deposits, identify loan and investment opportunities and maintain adequate capital levels. We may also grow\nthrough acquisitions of existing financial institutions or branches thereof. There are no guarantees that our expansion strategies will be successful. Also, in order to effectively manage our anticipated and/or actual loan growth we have and may continue to make additional investments in equipment and personnel, which also will increase our non-interest expense. If we grow too quickly and are not able to control costs and maintain asset quality, growth could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease. We maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate for absorbing any potential losses in our loan portfolio. Management, through a periodic review and consideration of the loan portfolio, determines the amount of the allowance for loan losses. Although we believe the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in our loan portfolio, even under normal economic conditions, we cannot predict such losses with certainty. The unprecedented volatility experienced in the financial and capital markets during the last several years makes this determination even more difficult as processes we use to estimate the allowance for loan losses may no longer be dependable because they rely on complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions that may not be accurate. As a result, we cannot be sure that our allowance is or will be adequate in the future. If management\u2019s assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect and the allowance for loan losses is inadequate to absorb future losses, our earnings will suffer.\nAs of December 31, 2014, commercial and industrial and commercial real estate mortgage loans comprise approximately 76.24% of our loan portfolio. These types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate or consumer loans and typically have larger balances than residential real estate loans and consumer loans. A deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non-performing loans. Such an increase could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur profitability depends on interest rates and changes in monetary policy may impact us. Our results of operations depend to a large extent on our \u201cnet interest income,\u201d which is the difference between the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities, such as interest on deposit accounts, and the interest income received from our interest earning assets, such as loans and investment securities. Interest rates, because they are influenced by, among other things, expectations about future events, including the level of economic activity, federal monetary and fiscal policy, and geopolitical stability, are not predictable or controllable. Additionally, competitive factors heavily influence the interest rates we can earn on our loan and investment portfolios and the interest rates we pay on our deposits. Community banks are often at a competitive disadvantage in managing their cost of funds compared to the large regional, super regional or national banks that have access to the national and international capital markets. These factors influence our ability to maintain a stable net interest margin.\nWe seek to maintain a neutral position in terms of the volume of assets and liabilities that mature or reprice during any period so that we may reasonably predict our net interest margin. However, interest rate fluctuations, loan prepayments, loan production and deposit flows are constantly changing and influence our ability to maintain this neutral position. Generally speaking, our earnings are more sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates the greater the variance in the volume of assets and liabilities that mature and reprice in any period. The extent and duration of the sensitivity will depend on the cumulative variance over time, the velocity and direction of interest rates, and whether we are more asset than liability sensitive. Accordingly, we may not be successful in maintaining this neutral position and, as a result, our net interest margin may suffer.\nThe market value of our investments could negatively impact stockholders\u2019 equity. We have designated all of our investment securities portfolio (or 13.2% of total assets) at December 31, 2014 as available for sale. We \u201cmark to market\u201d temporary unrealized gains and losses in the estimated value of the available for sale portfolio and reflect this adjustment as a separate item in stockholders\u2019 equity, net of taxes. As of December 31, 2014, we had temporary unrealized losses in our available for sale portfolio of $147 thousand (net of taxes). As a result of the recent economic recession and the continued economic slowdown, several municipalities continue to report budget deficits and companies continue to report lower earnings. These budget deficits and lower earnings could cause temporary and other than temporary impairment charges in our investment securities portfolio and cause us to report lower net income and a decline in stockholders\u2019 equity.\nAny future issuances of common stock in connection with acquisitions or otherwise could dilute your ownership of Old Line Bancshares. We may use our common stock to acquire other companies or to make investments in banks and other complementary businesses in the future. We may also issue common stock, or securities convertible into common stock, through public or private offerings, in order to raise additional capital in connection with future acquisitions, to satisfy regulatory capital requirements or for general corporate purposes. Any such stock issuances would dilute your ownership interest in Old Line Bancshares and may dilute the per-share value of the common stock.\nOur future acquisitions, if any, may cause us to become more susceptible to adverse economic events. While we currently have no agreements to acquire additional financial institutions, we may do so in the future if an attractive acquisition opportunity arises that is consistent with our business plan. Any future business acquisitions could be material to us, and the degree of success achieved in acquiring and integrating these businesses into Old Line Bancshares could have a material effect on the value of our common stock. In addition, any acquisition could require us to use substantial cash or other liquid assets or to incur debt. In those events, we could become more susceptible to future economic downturns and competitive pressures.\nWe face limits on our ability to lend. The amount of our capital limits the amount that we can loan to a single borrower. Generally, under current law, we may lend up to 15% of our unimpaired capital and surplus to any one borrower. As of December 31, 2014, we were able to lend approximately $17.4 million to any one borrower. This amount is significantly less than that of many of our larger competitors and may discourage potential borrowers who have credit needs in excess of our legal lending limit from doing business with us. We generally try to accommodate larger loans by selling participations in those loans to other financial institutions, but this strategy is not always available. We may not be able to attract or maintain customers seeking larger loans and we may not be able to sell participations in such loans on terms we consider favorable.\nAdditional capital may not be available when needed or required by regulatory authorities. Federal and state regulatory authorities require us to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. In addition, we may elect to raise additional capital to support our business or to finance future acquisitions, if any, or we may otherwise elect or our regulators may require that we raise additional capital. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control. Current conditions in the capital markets may be such that traditional sources of capital may not be available to us on reasonable terms if we needed to raise additional capital. Accordingly, we may not be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms that are favorable or otherwise not dilutive to existing stockholders. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, or on desirable terms, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe face substantial competition which could adversely affect our growth and operating results. We operate in a competitive market for financial services and face intense competition from other financial institutions both in making loans and in attracting deposits. Many of these financial institutions have been in business for many years, are significantly larger, have established customer bases, have greater financial resources and lending limits than we do, and are able to offer certain services that we are not able to offer. If we cannot attract deposits and make loans at a sufficient level, our operating results will suffer, as will our opportunities for growth.\nConsumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions. Technology and other changes are allowing consumers to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that they have historically held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts, mutual funds or general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 89938, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "OLBK"}
