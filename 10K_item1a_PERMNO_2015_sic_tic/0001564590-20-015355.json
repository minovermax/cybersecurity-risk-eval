{"cik": "862861", "company": "JanOne Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-04-06", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below with respect to an investment in our shares. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash provided by operations could be materially harmed. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment. When evaluating an investment in our common stock, you should also refer to the other information in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nRisks Relating to Our Business Generally\nOur results of operations may be negatively impacted by the coronavirus outbreak.\nIn December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus surfaced in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared a global emergency on January 30, 2020, with respect to the outbreak and several countries, including the United States, Japan and Australia have initiated travel restrictions to and from China. The impacts of the outbreak are unknown and rapidly evolving.\nThe widespread health crisis has adversely affected the global economy, resulting in an economic downturn that could impact demand for our products.\nTo date, the outbreak has started to have a material adverse impact on our operations. For example, several customers in our appliance recycling and appliance replacement business have suspended our ability to pick up and or replace their customers\u2019 appliances resulting in decreased revenues for both recycling and replacement business. The future impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted and there is no assurance that the outbreak will not have a material adverse impact on the future results of the Company. The extent of the impact, if any, will depend on future developments, including actions taken to contain the coronavirus.\nWe could incur charges due to impairment of long-lived assets.\nAt December 28, 2019, we had long-lived asset balances of approximately $20 million, which are subject to periodic testing for impairment. A significant amount of judgment is involved in the periodic testing. Failure to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow within our GeoTraq business, or sales of our branded products or cash flow generated from operations at individual store locations could result in impairment charges for intangible or long-lived assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations. Impairment charges, if any, resulting from the periodic testing are non-cash. A significant decline in the property fair values could result in long-lived asset impairment charges. A significant and sustained decline in our stock price could result in intangible and long-lived asset impairment charges. During times of financial market volatility, significant judgment is used to determine the underlying cause of the decline and whether stock price declines are short-term in nature or indicative of an event or change in circumstances. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nIf we fail to implement our business strategy or if our business strategy is ineffective, our financial performance could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon the effectiveness of our business strategy and our ability to implement our business strategy successfully. Implementation of our strategy will require effective management of our operational, financial and human resources and will place significant demands on those resources.\nThere are risks involved in pursuing our strategy, including the following:\n\u2022\nOur employees, customers or investors may not embrace and support our strategy.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to hire or retain the personnel necessary to manage our strategy effectively.\n\u2022\nWe may be unsuccessful in implementing improvements to operational efficiency and such efforts may not yield the intended result.\n\u2022\nWe may record material charges against earnings due to any number of events that could cause impairments to our assets.\nIn addition to the risks set forth above, effectiveness of and the successful implementation of our business strategy could also be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, such as increased competition, legal developments, government regulation, general economic conditions, increased operating costs or expenses and changes in industry trends. We may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time. If we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully, our long-term growth and profitability may be adversely affected. Even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business strategy successfully, our operating results may not improve and could decline substantially.\nA cybersecurity incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers.\nWe use computers and transact, receive, transmit and store electronic data in substantially all aspects of our business operations. We also use mobile devices, social networking and other online activities to communicate with our employees and our customers. Such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. Our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information, including customers\u2019 personal information, private information about employees, and financial and strategic information about the Company and its business partners. If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with new initiatives, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. Additionally, while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability and competitive disadvantage.\nThere is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches. Any such compromise of our security or the security of information residing with our business associates or third parties could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and may expose us to material costs, penalties, compensation claims, lost sales, fines and lawsuits. In addition, any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk.\nFailure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nCertain elements of our cost structure are largely fixed in nature. The negative impact of not renewing existing or securing new contracts on our business could make it more challenging for us to maintain or increase our operating income. The competitiveness in our industries and increasing price pressures and transparency means that the focus on achieving efficient operations is greater than ever. As a result, we must continuously focus on achieving new contracts and managing our cost structure. Failure to manage our labor and benefit rates, operating leases, other facility expenses or indirect spending could materially adversely affect our profitability.\nAny failure of our information technology infrastructure or management information systems could cause a disruption in our business and our results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.\nOur ability to operate our business from day to day largely depends on the efficient operation of our information technology infrastructure and management information systems. We use our management information systems to conduct our operations and plan critical corporate and business functions, including recycling operations, sales management, supply chain and inventory management, financial reporting and accounting, delivery and other customer services and various administrative functions. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes and hurricanes, and usage errors by our employees. Operating legacy systems subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with maintaining, upgrading and replacing these systems and retaining sufficiently skilled personnel to maintain and operate the systems which may also place demands on management time, as well as create other risks and costs. Any failure that is not covered by our disaster recovery plan could cause an interruption in our operations and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing substantial amounts of space, including future increases in occupancy costs.\nWe lease our corporate headquarters and recycling centers. Our continued growth and success depend in part on our ability to locate desirable property for new recycling centers and renew leases for existing locations. Because there is no assurance that we will be able to locate acceptable real estate for new recycling centers, or re-negotiate leases for existing locations at similar or favorable terms at the end of the lease term, we could be forced to move or exit a market if another favorable arrangement cannot be made. Furthermore, a significant rise in real estate prices or real property taxes could result in an increase in lease expense as we open new locations and renew leases for existing locations, thereby negatively impacting the Company's results of operations. The inability of the Company to renew, extend or replace expiring leases could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.\nWe depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease expenses. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to fund these expenses, we may not be able to service our lease expenses, which could materially harm our business.\nIf an existing recycling center is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Moreover, even if a lease has an early cancellation clause, we may not satisfy the contractual requirements for early cancellation under that lease. Our inability to enter into new leases or renew existing leases on terms acceptable to us or be released from our obligations under leases for recycling centers that we close could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.\nWe have identified and disclosed in this Form 10-K material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are not able to remediate these material weaknesses and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial results, which could cause our stock price to fall or result in our stock being delisted.\nWe need to devote significant resources and time to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d) with respect to internal control over financial reporting. In addition, Section 404 under Sarbanes-Oxley requires that we assess the design and operating effectiveness of our controls over financial reporting, which are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports.\nAs reported in Part II - Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, there were material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting at December 28, 2019. Specifically, management noted material weaknesses in internal control when conducting their evaluation of internal control as of December 28, 2019. (1) Insufficient information technology general controls (\u201cITGC\u201d) and segregation of duties. It was noted that people who were negotiating a contract, were also involved in approving invoices without proper oversight. Additional controls and procedures are necessary and are being implemented to have check and balance on significant transactions and governance with those charged with governance authority. (2) Inadequate control design or lack of sufficient controls over significant accounting processes. The cutoff and reconciliation procedures were not effective with certain accrued and deferred expenses. (3) Insufficient assessment of the impact of potentially significant transactions, and (4) Insufficient processes and procedures related to proper recordkeeping of agreements and contracts. In addition, contract to invoice reconciliation was not effective with certain transportation service providers. As part of its remediation plan, processes and procedures have been implemented to help ensure accruals and invoices are reviewed for accuracy and properly recorded in the appropriate period.\nWe expect our systems and controls to become increasingly complex to the extent that we integrate acquisitions and as our business grows. To effectively manage our company today and this anticipated complexity, we need to remediate these material weaknesses and continue to improve our operational, financial, and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. Any failure to remediate these material weaknesses and implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation or operation of these controls, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could adversely affect our business and jeopardize our listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market, either of which would harm our stock price.\nRisks Relating to Our Biotechnology Segment\nOur biotechnology business has a limited operating history.\nOur biotechnology business was started in September 2019 and has limited operating history. We have not commenced revenue-producing operations. To date, our biotechnology-related operations have consisted of preliminary research and development, and characterization and testing of SR TV1001, our initial product candidate. Our limited operating history makes it difficult for potential investors to evaluate our technology or the prospective operations of our biotechnology business. Because our biotechnology business is in the development stage, , we are subject to all the risks inherent in the organization, financing, expenditures, complications, and delays involved with such a business. Accordingly, you should consider the prospects of our biotechnology business in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of development, especially clinical-stage biopharmaceutical businesses such as ours. Potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties that a biotechnology business with a limited operating history faces. In particular, potential investors should consider that we may be unable to:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully implement or execute the business plan of our biotechnology business, or that our biotechnology business plan is sound;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for the marketing of our product candidate;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully demonstrate a favorable differentiation between our product candidate and the current products on the market;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully manufacture of our clinical drug product and establish a commercial drug supply;\n\u2022\nsecure market exclusivity and/or adequate intellectual property protection for our product candidate;\n\u2022\nattract and retain an experienced management and advisory team; and\n\u2022\nraise sufficient funds in the capital markets to effectuate our biotechnology business plan, including product and clinical development, regulatory approval, and commercialization for our product candidate.\nInvestors should evaluate an investment in us in light of the uncertainties encountered by developing biotechnology businesses in a competitive environment. There can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful. If we cannot successfully execute any one of the foregoing, our business may not succeed and your investment will be adversely affected. You must be prepared to lose all of your investment.\nWe expect we will need additional financing to execute our biotechnology business plan and fund the operations of our biotechnology business, which additional financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nAs of December 28, 2019, we had total assets of $29 million and negative working capital of $8.7 million. As of December 28, 2019, our liquidity included $481 thousand of cash and cash equivalents. We believe that we will require a significant amount of capital, in addition to our cash on hand, in order to fund the development of our initial product candidate, SR TV1001, through the completion of its Phase IIb/IIIa studies, respectively. However, as of the date of this Form 10-K, we believe that we will need additional capital to obtain marketing approval for SR TV1001, assuming such approval can be obtained at all. We intend to seek additional funds through various financing sources, including the potential sale of our recycling business and the sale of our equity securities. However, there can be no guarantees that such funds will be available on terms that we deem reasonable, if at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to further pursue our business plan and we may be unable to continue operations, in which case you may lose your entire investment.\nOur business model is entirely dependent on certain patent rights licensed to us from the Licensors (as defined below), and the loss of those license rights would, in all likelihood, cause our business, as presently contemplated, to fail.\nIn November 2019, UAB Research Foundation (\u201cUABRF\u201d), TheraVasc, Inc. (\u201cTheraVasc\u201d), and the Board of Supervisors of Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, acting on behalf of LSU Health Sciences Center at Shreveport (\u201cLSU Health Shreveport\u201d, together with UABRF and TheraVasc, the \u201cLicensors\u201d), granted us an exclusive worldwide, royalty bearing license to the patent rights for SR TV1001 in the negotiated fields of use. The patent license agreement requires us to pay royalties and milestone payments and conform to a variety of covenants and agreements, and in the event of our breach of the agreement, the Licensors may elect to terminate the agreement. As of the date of this Form 10-K, we believe we are in compliance with the patent license agreement and consider our relationship with the Licensors to be excellent.\nWe currently have no sales and marketing organization. If we are unable to establish satisfactory sales and marketing capabilities or secure a third-party sales and marketing relationship, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates.\nAt present, we have no sales or marketing personnel. Upon and subject to initial receipt of the requisite regulatory approvals for our drug product, we intend to commercialize our drug products through a combination of our internal direct sales force, third-party marketing and distribution relationships. In some cases, we may pursue the licensing of our SR TV1001 technology or enter into a joint development arrangement. If we are not successful in recruiting sales and marketing personnel and building a sales and marketing infrastructure or entering into appropriate collaboration arrangements with third parties, we will have difficulty successfully commercializing our product candidates, which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nEven if we enter into third-party marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have limited or no control over the sales, marketing and distribution activities of these third parties. Our future revenues may depend heavily on the success of the efforts of these third parties. In terms of establishing a sales and marketing infrastructure, we will\nhave to compete with established and well-funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train and retain sales and marketing personnel. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to build an internal sales organization or enter into collaboration arrangements with third parties include:\n\u2022\nour inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an internal sales and marketing organization.\nWe will be completely dependent on third parties to manufacture our product candidate, and the commercialization of our product candidate could be halted, delayed, or made less profitable if those third parties fail to obtain manufacturing approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of our product candidates or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices.\nWe do not currently have, nor do we plan to acquire, the capability or infrastructure to manufacture our drug candidate for use in our clinical trials or for commercial sales, if any. As a result, we will be obligated to rely on contract manufacturers, when we conduct clinical trials and if and when any of our product candidates are approved for commercialization. In January 2020, we entered into a Master Agreement for Development, Manufacturing and Supply with CoreRx Inc. (\u201cCoreRx\u201d), pursuant to which CoreRx has agreed to provide to us certain product testing, development, and clinical manufacturing services. We have not entered into agreements with any contract manufacturers for commercial supply and may not be able to engage contract manufacturers for commercial supply of any of our product candidates on favorable terms to us, or at all, should the need arise.\nIn a previous clinical trial, the manufacture of SR TV1001 by a different manufacturing company resulted in product that demonstrated initial instability that led to the product being out-of-specification. While the FDA allowed the trial to continue, there is no guarantee that if the product manufactured by CoreRx is similarly unstable, the FDA will allow us to continue to develop the product. Even if the product manufactured by CoreRx is stable, the FDA may require additional studies to confirm the stability of the product, increasing development cost and times.\nThe facilities used by CoreRx to manufacture our product candidate must be approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Such approvals are subject to inspections that will be conducted after we submit a NDA or Biologics License Application (\u201cBLA\u201d) to the FDA or their equivalents to other relevant regulatory authorities. We will not control the manufacturing process of our product candidates and will be completely dependent on our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMPs, for manufacture of both active drug substances and finished drug products. These cGMP regulations cover all aspects of the manufacturing, testing, quality control, storage, distribution and record keeping relating to our product candidates. If our contract manufacturers do not successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, we will not be able to secure or maintain regulatory approval for product made at their manufacturing facilities. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, manufacture, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved. Likewise, we could be negatively impacted if any of our contract manufacturers elect to discontinue their business relationship with us.\nOur contract manufacturer will be subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies for compliance with cGMPs and similar regulatory requirements. We will not have control over our contract manufacturer\u2019s compliance with these regulations and standards. Failure by our contract manufacturer to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure to grant approval to market our product candidate, delays, suspensions or withdrawals of approvals, inability to supply product, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect our biotechnology business. In addition, we will not have control over the ability of our contract manufacturer to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance\nand qualified personnel. Failure by our contract manufacturer to comply with or maintain any of these standards could adversely affect our ability to develop, manufacture, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidate, if approved.\nOur manufacturer must obtain the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, from a third party. A number of groups manufacturer our API, however, some of these are manufactured as a food product, and others, while manufactured under GMP do not have the required Drug Master File on file with the FDA. We may be required to work with the API manufacturer to file the appropriate documents and there is no guarantee that the FDA will approve the filing. This could necessitate additional funding to hire an API manufacturer and produce the product under GMP with all necessary filings.\nIf, for any reason, these third parties are unable or unwilling to perform, we may not be able to locate alternative manufacturers or formulators or enter into favorable agreements with them and we cannot be certain that any such third parties will have the manufacturing capacity to meet future requirements. If these manufacturers or any alternate manufacturer of finished drug product experiences any significant difficulties in its respective manufacturing processes for APIs, or finished products or should cease doing business with us for any reason, we could experience significant interruptions in the supply of any of our product candidates or may not be able to create a supply of our product candidates at all. Were we to encounter manufacturing difficulties, our ability to produce a sufficient supply of any of our product candidates might be negatively affected. Our inability to coordinate the efforts of our third-party manufacturing partners, or the lack of capacity available at our third-party manufacturing partners, could impair our ability to supply any of our product candidates at required levels. Because of the significant regulatory requirements that we would need to satisfy in order to qualify a new bulk drug substance or finished product manufacturer, if we face these or other difficulties with our then current manufacturing partners, we could experience significant interruptions in the supply of any of our product candidates if we decided to transfer the manufacture of any of our product candidates to one or more alternative manufacturers in an effort to deal with such difficulties.\nAny manufacturing problem or the loss of our contract manufacturer could be disruptive to our operations and result in development delays and lost sales. Additionally, we will rely on third parties to supply the raw materials needed to manufacture our product candidates. Any such reliance on suppliers may involve several risks, including a potential inability to obtain critical materials and reduced control over production costs, delivery schedules, reliability and quality. Any unanticipated disruption to the operation of one of our contract manufacturers caused by problems with suppliers could delay shipment of any of our product candidates, increase our cost of goods sold and result in lost sales.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe will face a potential risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidate and will face an even greater risk of such liability if we commercialize our product candidate. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop, including any of our product candidate, or any materials that we use in our product candidate, allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. In the U.S., claims could also be asserted against us under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidate. Even successful defense of these claims would require us to employ significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our product candidate or any future products that we may develop;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidate;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of participants in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with our defense of the related litigation;\n\u2022\na diversion of our management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our product candidate; and\n\u2022\na decline in the value of our stock.\nAs of the date of this Form 10-K, we do not carry product liability insurance. However, we intend to obtain product liability insurance prior to clinical testing that we consider adequate for our current level of clinical testing and development. However, we will need additional product liability coverage at the time we commence commercial sale of our initial product. Our inability to obtain and retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products we develop. Although we will endeavor to obtain and maintain such insurance in coverage amounts we deem adequate, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies would also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. As a result, we may have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts.\nSales of counterfeit versions of our product candidate, as well as unauthorized sales of our product candidate, may have adverse effects on our revenues, business, results of operations and damage our brand and reputation.\nOur product candidate may become subject to competition from counterfeit pharmaceutical products, which are pharmaceutical products sold under the same or very similar brand names and/or having a similar appearance to genuine products, but which are sold without proper licenses or approvals. Such products divert sales from genuine products, often are of lower cost and quality (having different ingredients or formulations, for example), and have the potential to damage the reputation for quality and effectiveness of the genuine product. Obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidate is a complex and lengthy process. If during the period while the regulatory approval is pending illegal sales of counterfeit products begin, consumers may buy such counterfeit products, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues, biotechnology business and results of operations. In addition, if illegal sales of counterfeits result in adverse side effects to consumers, we may be associated with any negative publicity resulting from such incidents. Although pharmaceutical regulation, control, and enforcement systems throughout the world have been increasingly active in policing counterfeit pharmaceuticals, we may not be able to prevent third parties from manufacturing, selling or purporting to sell counterfeit products competing with our product candidate. Such sales may also be occurring without our knowledge. The existence and any increase in production or sales of counterfeit products or unauthorized sales could negatively impact our revenues, brand reputation, biotechnology business and results of operations.\nThe success of our biotechnology business is entirely dependent on our ability to obtain the marketing approval for our product candidate by the FDA and the regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions in which we intend to market our product candidate, of which there can be no assurance.\nWe are not permitted to market our product candidate as prescription pharmaceutical products in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA, or in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from such countries. In the United States, the FDA generally requires the completion of clinical trials of each drug to establish its safety and efficacy and extensive pharmaceutical development to ensure its quality before an NDA is approved. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage result in the submission of an NDA to the FDA and even fewer are eventually approved for commercialization. As of the date of this Form 10-K, we have not submitted an NDA to the FDA or comparable applications to other regulatory authorities for any of our product candidates.\nBecause of the clinical trial history of SR TV1001, we believe that our initial drug product candidate will qualify for FDA approval through the FDA\u2019s 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway and in corresponding regulatory paths in other foreign jurisdictions. Notwithstanding the use of the FDA\u2019s 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, we will be required to conduct Phase IIb/IIIa studies prior to filing for marketing approval of our product candidate.\nOur success depends on our receipt of the regulatory approvals described above, and the issuance of such regulatory approvals is uncertain and subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe results of toxicology studies may not support the filing of an NDA for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may require additional pharmacokinetic studies with SR TV1001, including studies with food, prior to allowing the Company to conduct Phase IIb/IIIa trials;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities or Institutional Review Boards, or IRB, may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to provide acceptable evidence of our product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy;\n\u2022\nthe results of our clinical trials may not be satisfactory or may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA, European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or other regulatory agencies for us to receive marketing approval for our product candidate;\n\u2022\nthe dosing of our product candidate in a particular clinical trial may not be at an optimal level;\n\u2022\npatients in our clinical trials may suffer adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to our product candidate;\n\u2022\nthe data collected from clinical trials may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA, BLA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n\u2022\nthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval of our product candidate.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory approvals is expensive, often takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon, among other things, the type, complexity, and novelty of the product candidates involved, the jurisdiction in which regulatory approval is sought and the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. Changes in regulatory approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for a submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory approval obtained in one jurisdiction does not necessarily mean that a product candidate will receive regulatory approval in all jurisdictions in which we may seek approval, but the failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may negatively impact our ability to seek approval in a different jurisdiction. Failure to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidate for the foregoing, or any other reasons, will prevent us from commercializing our product candidate, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nClinical testing is expensive, is difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome.\nOur business model depends in part on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidate, which may never occur. Our product candidate is in the early stages of development and as of the date of this Form 10-K we have not progressed our product candidate beyond early clinical studies designed only to show safety and animal testing. While TheraVasc has submitted and had two INDs accepted by the FDA, it is not clear whether the INDs remain active and can be transferred to the Company. As of the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, we had requested that TheraVasc and its subsequent licensee request the INDs to be transferred by the\nFDA to the Company, however, the actual transfer is still pending. Even if the INDs are transferred to us, the FDA may still require additional work prior to re-initiation of clinical trials. If we do not obtain such approvals to re-initiate trials as presently planned, the time in which we expect to commence clinical programs for any product candidate will be extended and such extension will increase our expenses, delay our potential receipt of any revenues, and increase our need for additional capital. Moreover, there is no guarantee that we will receive approval to commence human clinical trials or, if we do receive approval, that our clinical trials will be successful or that we will continue clinical development in support of an approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for any indication. We note that most product candidates never reach the clinical development stage and even those that do commence clinical development have only a small chance of successfully completing clinical development and gaining regulatory approval. Success in early phases of pre-clinical and clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates. Therefore, our business currently depends entirely on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates, which may never occur.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for our product candidate, we may not be able to successfully commercialize the product and the revenue that we generate from its sales, if any, may be limited.\nIf approved for marketing, the commercial success of our product candidate will depend upon the product\u2019s acceptance by the medical community, including physicians, patients, and health care payors. The degree of market acceptance for our product candidate will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ndemonstration of clinical safety and efficacy;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience, dosing burden and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any adverse effects;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of physicians to prescribe our product candidate, and the target patient population to try new therapies;\n\u2022\nefficacy of our product candidate compared to competing products;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of any new products that may in the future become available targeting indications for which our product candidate may be approved;\n\u2022\nnew procedures or therapies that may reduce the incidences of any of the indications in which our product candidate may show utility;\n\u2022\npricing and cost-effectiveness;\n\u2022\nthe inclusion or omission of our product candidate in applicable guidelines;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our own or any future collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategies;\n\u2022\nlimitations or warnings contained in approved labeling from regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement from government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors or to receive the necessary pricing approvals from government bodies regulating the pricing and usage of therapeutics; and\n\u2022\nthe willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage or reimbursement or government pricing approvals.\nIf our product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors, and patients, our biotechnology business may not generate sufficient revenue to cover costs. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidate may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nIn addition, even if we obtain regulatory approvals, the timing or scope of any approvals may prohibit or reduce our ability to commercialize our product candidate successfully. For example, if the approval process takes too long, we may miss market opportunities and give other companies the ability to develop competing products or establish market dominance. Any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that renders our product candidate not commercially viable. For example, regulatory authorities may approve our product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may not approve the price we intend to charge for our product candidate, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve any of our product candidates with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that indication. Further, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may place conditions on approvals or require risk management plans or a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. Moreover, product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following the initial marketing of the product. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial success of our product candidate.\nEven if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidate, we will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, our product candidate could be subject to labeling and other restrictions and withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our product candidate.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidate for an indication, the FDA or foreign equivalent may still impose significant restrictions on its indicated uses or marketing or the conditions of approval, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly and time-consuming post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and post-market surveillance to monitor safety and efficacy. Our product candidate will also be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements governing the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of adverse events and other post-market information. These requirements include registration with the FDA, as well as continued compliance with current good clinical practices regulations for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current cGMPs, requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents.\nThe FDA has the authority to require a REMS as part of an NDA or after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved drug, such as limiting prescribing to certain physicians or medical centers that have undergone specialized training, limiting treatment to patients who meet certain safe-use criteria or requiring patient testing, monitoring and/or enrollment in a registry.\nWith respect to sales and marketing activities related to our product candidate, advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules in addition to other applicable federal, state and local laws in the United States and similar legal requirements in other countries. In the United States, the distribution of product samples to physicians must comply with the requirements of the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act. Application holders must obtain FDA approval for product and manufacturing changes, depending on the nature of the change. We may also be subject, directly or indirectly through our customers and partners, to various fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, U.S. False Claims Act, and similar state laws, which impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and scientific/educational grant programs. If we participate in the U.S. Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the Federal Supply Schedule of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or other government drug programs, we will be subject to complex laws and regulations regarding reporting and payment obligations. All of these activities are also potentially subject to U.S. federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. Similar requirements exist in many of these areas in other countries.\nIn addition, if our product candidate is approved for a particular indication, our product labeling, advertising and promotion would be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. If we receive marketing approval for our product candidate, physicians may nevertheless legally prescribe our product to their patients in a\nmanner that is inconsistent with the approved label. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability and government fines. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant sanctions. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees of permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.\nIf we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product candidate, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or we or our manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to the following administrative or judicial sanctions:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u2022\nissuance of warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nclinical holds;\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspension of any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\u2022\nsuspension or imposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022\nproduct seizure or detention or refusal to permit the import or export of product.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidate and generate revenue. Adverse regulatory action, whether pre- or post-approval, can also potentially lead to product liability claims and increase our product liability exposure.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidate in one jurisdiction does not mean that we will be successful in obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidate in other jurisdictions.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approval in any other jurisdiction, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. For example, even if the FDA grants marketing approval of a product candidate, comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions must also approve the manufacturing, marketing and promotion of the product candidate in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, as clinical studies conducted in one jurisdiction may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that jurisdiction. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our products is also subject to approval.\nObtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our product candidates in certain countries. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets and/ or to receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidate will be harmed.\nCurrent and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval for our product candidate, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell our product candidate. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We do not know whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidate, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for drugs. In addition, this legislation authorized Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to use formularies where they can limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for our product candidates and could seriously harm our business. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 or, collectively, the Health Care Reform Law, is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The Health Care Reform Law revised the definition of \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. Further, the law imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products.\nThe Health Care Reform Law remains subject to legislative efforts to repeal, modify or delay the implementation of the law. If the Health Care Reform Law is repealed or modified, or if implementation of certain aspects of the Health Care Reform Law are delayed, such repeal, modification or delay may materially adversely impact our business, strategies, prospects, operating results or financial condition. We are unable to predict the full impact of any repeal, modification or delay in the implementation of the Health Care Reform Law on us at this time. Due to the substantial regulatory changes that will need to be implemented by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, and others, and the numerous processes required to implement these reforms, we cannot predict which healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level, the timing of any such reforms, or the effect such reforms or any other future legislation or regulation will have on our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Health Care Reform Law was enacted. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce or eliminate our profitability.\nAny termination or suspension of, or delays in the commencement or completion of, any necessary studies of any of our product candidate for any indications could result in increased costs to us, delay or limit our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our commercial prospects.\nThe commencement and completion of clinical studies can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to:\n\u2022\nthe FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority failing to grant permission to proceed and placing the clinical study on hold;\n\u2022\nsubjects for clinical testing failing to enroll or remain enrolled in our trials at the rate we expect;\n\u2022\na facility manufacturing any of our product candidates being ordered by the FDA or other government or regulatory authorities to temporarily or permanently shut down due to violations of cGMP requirements or other applicable requirements, or cross-contaminations of product candidates in the manufacturing process;\n\u2022\nany changes to our manufacturing process that may be necessary or desired;\n\u2022\nsubjects choosing an alternative treatment for the indications for which we are developing our product candidates, or participating in competing clinical studies;\n\u2022\nsubjects experiencing severe or unexpected drug-related adverse effects;\n\u2022\nreports from clinical testing on similar technologies and products raising safety and/or efficacy concerns;\n\u2022\nthird-party clinical investigators losing their license or permits necessary to perform our clinical trials, not performing our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or employing methods consistent with the clinical trial protocol, cGMP requirements, or other third parties not performing data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u2022\ninspections of clinical study sites by the FDA, comparable foreign regulatory authorities, or IRBs finding regulatory violations that require us to undertake corrective action, result in suspension or termination of one or more sites or the imposition of a clinical hold on the entire study, or that prohibit us from using some or all of the data in support of our marketing applications;\n\u2022\nthird-party contractors becoming debarred or suspended or otherwise penalized by the FDA or other government or regulatory authorities for violations of regulatory requirements, in which case we may need to find a substitute contractor, and we may not be able to use some or any of the data produced by such contractors in support of our marketing applications;\n\u2022\none or more IRBs refusing to approve, suspending or terminating the study at an investigational site, precluding enrollment of additional subjects, or withdrawing its approval of the trial; reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022\ndeviations of the clinical sites from trial protocols or dropping out of a trial;\n\u2022\nadding new clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nthe inability of the CRO to execute any clinical trials for any reason; and\n\u2022\ngovernment or regulatory delays or \u201cclinical holds\u201d requiring suspension or termination of a trial.\nProduct development costs for any of our product candidates will increase if we have delays in testing or approval or if we need to perform more or larger clinical studies than planned. Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements and policies may occur and we may need to amend study protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our study protocols to the FDA, comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and IRBs for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of that study. If we experience delays in completion of, or if we, the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the IRB, or other reviewing entities, or any of our clinical study sites suspend or terminate any of our clinical studies of any of our product candidates, its commercial\nprospects may be materially harmed and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed. Any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, termination or suspension of, or a delay in the commencement or completion of, clinical studies may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates. In addition, if one or more clinical studies are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring competing products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of any of our affected product candidates could be significantly reduced.\nThird-party coverage and reimbursement and health care cost containment initiatives and treatment guidelines may constrain our future revenues.\nOur ability to successfully market our product candidate will depend in part on the level of reimbursement that government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other organizations provide for the cost of our product candidate and related treatments. Countries in which our product candidate is sold through reimbursement schemes under national health insurance programs frequently require that manufacturers and sellers of pharmaceutical products obtain governmental approval of initial prices and any subsequent price increases. In certain countries, including the United States, government-funded and private medical care plans can exert significant indirect pressure on prices. We may not be able to sell our product candidate profitably if adequate prices are not approved or coverage and reimbursement is unavailable or limited in scope. Increasingly, third-party payors attempt to contain health care costs in ways that are likely to impact the development of our product including:\n\u2022\nfailing to approve or challenging the prices charged for health care products;\n\u2022\nintroducing reimportation schemes from lower priced jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nlimiting both coverage and the amount of reimbursement for new therapeutic products;\n\u2022\ndenying or limiting coverage for products that are approved by the regulatory agencies but are considered to be experimental or investigational by third-party payors; and\n\u2022\nrefusing to provide coverage when an approved product is used in a way that has not received regulatory marketing approval.\nWe are dependent on rights to certain technologies licensed to us. We do not have complete control over these technologies and any loss of our rights to them could prevent us from selling our product candidate.\nAs noted above, the business model of our biotechnology business is entirely dependent on certain patent rights licensed to us by the Licensors. See, \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business - Our business model is entirely dependent on certain patent rights licensed to us from the Licensors, and the loss of those license rights would, in all likelihood, cause our business, as presently contemplated, to fail.\u201d Because we will hold those rights as a licensee, we have limited control over certain important aspects of those patent rights. Pursuant to the patent license agreement, the Licensors have reserved the right to control all decisions concerning the prosecution and maintenance of all U.S. and foreign patents, as well as all decisions concerning the enforcement of any actions against potential infringers of the patent rights. We believe that the Licensors share a common interest in these matters with us, and the Licensors have agreed to consult with us on the prosecution and enforcement of possible infringement claims as well as other matters for which the Licensors have retained control. However, there can be no assurance that the Licensors will agree with our views as to how best to prosecute, maintain and defend the patent rights subject to the patent license agreement.\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property rights, and we cannot ensure the protection of these rights.\nThe commercial success of our biotechnology business will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully defend the patent rights subject to our patent license agreement with the Licensors against third-party challenges and successfully enforcing these patent rights against third party competitors. The patent positions of pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws may\ndiminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowable or enforceable in the patent applications subject to the patent license agreement. The patents and patent applications relating to our product candidate may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties and might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by the patent rights licensed to us is uncertain, because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights, permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage, or provide us with any competitive advantage at all. We cannot be certain that any patent application owned by a third party will not have priority over patent applications in which we hold license rights or that we will not be involved in interference, opposition or invalidity proceedings before United States or foreign patent offices.\nAdditionally, if the Licensors were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering our product candidate, the defendant could counterclaim that such patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge include alleged failures to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for unenforceability assertions include allegations that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the U.S. PTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post grant review and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions, e.g. opposition proceedings. Such proceedings could result in revocation or amendment of the Licensors\u2019 patents in such a way that they no longer cover our product candidate or competitive products. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to validity, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which the Licensors and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on any of our product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIn the future, we may rely on know-how and trade secrets to protect technology, especially in cases in which we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. However, know-how and trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we intend to require employees, academic collaborators, consultants and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements, we may not be able to adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary or licensed information. Typically, research collaborators and scientific advisors have rights to publish data and information in which we may have rights. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets than patents. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nIf we fail to obtain or maintain patent protection or trade secret protection for our product candidates or our technologies, third parties could use our proprietary information, which could impair our ability to compete in the market and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and attain profitability.\nIt is difficult and costly to block others from developing similar products for other indications, and we cannot ensure that these products will not be less expensive and thus be prescribed off-label by physicians for use in our indications.\nOur success depends on successfully blocking others from developing and commercializing similar products. As a repurposed drug, our API has been approved for acute use in cyanide poisoning. Although the injectable used for cyanide poisoning does not represent a threat to our product, since the API itself cannot be protected, we will rely on method of use and oral formulation patents to protect our product which puts our product at risk from companies developing oral formulations using the same API for other indications. Even though our patents provide protection for specific uses, we will not be able to prevent other companies from developing the same API for other uses. If a similar dose, formulation and route of administration is developed for another indication by a different company, we cannot guarantee that the product they market for the other indication will not be prescribed off-label by doctors or filled by pharmacists for use in indications our patents cover and that if less expensive, would not negatively affect our sales, if our product is ultimately approved by the FDA.\nOur product candidate may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which could increase our costs and delay or prevent our development and commercialization efforts.\nOur success depends in part on avoiding infringement of the proprietary technologies of others. The pharmaceutical industry has been characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Identification of third-party patent rights that may be relevant to our proprietary technology is difficult because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. Additionally, because patent applications are maintained in secrecy until the application is published, we may be unaware of third-party patents that may be infringed by commercialization of our product candidate or any future product candidate. There may be certain issued patents and patent applications claiming subject matter that we may be required to license in order to research, develop or commercialize any of our product candidates, and we do not know if such patents and patent applications would be available to license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any claims of patent infringement asserted by third parties would be time-consuming and may:\n\u2022\nresult in costly litigation;\n\u2022\ndivert the time and attention of our technical personnel and management;\n\u2022\nprevent us from commercializing a product until the asserted patent expires or is held finally invalid or not infringed in a court of law;\n\u2022\nrequire us to cease or modify our use of the technology and/or develop non-infringing technology; or\n\u2022\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.\nThird parties may hold proprietary rights that could prevent our product candidate from being marketed. Any patent-related legal action against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to any of our product candidates or our processes could subject us to potential liability for damages and require us to obtain a license to continue to manufacture or market our product candidate or any future product candidates. We cannot predict whether we would prevail in any such actions or that any license required under any of these patents would be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, we cannot be sure that we could redesign our product candidate or any future product candidates or processes to avoid infringement, if necessary. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or the failure to obtain necessary licenses, could prevent us from developing and commercializing our product candidate or a future product candidate, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe expect that there are other companies, including major pharmaceutical companies, working in the areas competitive to our product candidates which either has resulted, or may result, in the filing of patent applications that may be deemed related to our activities. If we were to challenge the validity of these or any issued United States patent in court, we would need to overcome a statutory presumption of validity that attaches to every issued United States patent. This means that, in order to prevail, we would have to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent\u2019s claims. If we were to challenge the validity of these or any issued United States patent in an administrative trial before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board in the U.S. PTO, we would have to prove that the claims are unpatentable by a preponderance of the evidence. There is no assurance that a jury and/or court would find in our favor on questions of infringement, validity or enforceability. Even if we are successful, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nWe may be subject to claims that we have wrongfully hired an employee from a competitor or that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged confidential information or trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is commonplace in our industry, we will employ individuals who were previously employed at other pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject in the future to claims that our employees or prospective employees are subject to a continuing obligation to their former employers (such as non-competition or non-solicitation obligations) or claims that our employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against\nthese claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nRisks Relating to Our Recycling Business\nOur revenues, earnings and cash flows will fluctuate based on changes in commodity prices.\nOur recycling operations process for sale certain recyclable materials, including steel, aluminium, and copper, all of which are subject to significant market price fluctuations. The majority of the recyclables we process for sale are steel and non-ferrous metals. The fluctuations in the market prices or demand for such commodity items, particularly demand from China and Turkey, can affect our future operating income and cash flows negatively, such as we experienced in 2015 and 2014. As we have increased the size of our recycling operations, we have also increased our exposure to commodity price fluctuations.\nIn the past we also earned a significant amount of revenue from the sale of carbon credits. The creation of carbon offsets involves a consultant's establishment of a project that includes the successful destruction of the Company's ozone-depleting refrigerants. The project process involves a significant degree of regulatory compliance and only a limited number of facilities are approved to destroy ozone-depleting refrigerants. While we no longer sell carbon credits, we currently sell our ozone-depleting refrigerants to consultants that manage the creation of carbon offsets, and we no longer engage in the production process itself. If we are unable to find businesses that purchase ozone-depleting refrigerants for the creation of carbon offsets or if the carbon credit programs are significantly altered or discontinued or a governmental authority requires the destruction of refrigerants, thereby reducing or eliminating the market for these refrigerants, we would be required to destroy these substances without the benefit of selling them to other companies that generate carbon offsets, which would increase the costs of our operations and result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe purchase our replacement appliances from third-party manufacturers, who we believe manufacture those appliances in China, and, as a result, international trade conditions could adversely affect us.\nWe purchase our replacement appliances from third-party manufacturers, who we believe manufacture certain types of those appliances in China or purchase materials or parts from China for use in manufacturing. As a result, tariffs, political or financial instability, labor strikes, natural disasters, public health crises (such as the coronavirus), or other events resulting in the disruption of trade or transportation from China or the imposition of additional regulations relating to foreign trade could cause significant delays or interruptions in the supply of our merchandise or increase our costs, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business. If we were unable to adequately replace the merchandise we currently source with merchandise produced elsewhere, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe United States has recently imposed tariffs on various imports from China, including some of our replacement appliances. Since the imposition of these tariffs, third-party manufacturers have increased the price of the appliances we purchase from them and retain the right to implement further increases. These tariffs remain largely unmitigated and the Company cannot predict if and when the tariffs will be reduced or eliminated. The ongoing impact of these tariffs will depend on future trade discussions between the U.S. and China or the Company\u2019s ability to avoid or offset these costs should the tariffs remain in place. The Company may not be able to pass such increased costs on to its customers, and the Company may not be able to secure sources of certain products and materials that are not subject to tariffs on a timely basis or at all. Such developments could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our third-party collection or delivery services are unable to meet our promised pickup and delivery schedules, our net sales may decline due to a decline in customer satisfaction.\nWe offer appliance pickup and delivery services, which are significantly outsourced to third-party providers. Our third-party services are subject to risks that are beyond our control. If appliances are not picked up on time, or at all, or products are not delivered on time, our clients and customers may cancel their orders, or we may lose business from our clients and customers in the future. As a result, our net sales and profitability may decline.\nOur sales may not be an indication of our future results of operations because they fluctuate significantly.\nOur current and historical sales figures have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter. A number of factors have historically affected, and will continue to affect, our sales results and profitability, including:\n\u2022\nChanges in competition, such as pricing pressure.\n\u2022\nPeriodic sale of ozone-depleting refrigerants used in the creation of carbon offsets.\n\u2022\nFluctuating commodity prices and available markets for our byproduct sales.\n\u2022\nChanges in recycling and replacement programs with utility customers.\n\u2022\nGeneral economic conditions.\n\u2022\nWeather conditions in our markets.\n\u2022\nTiming of promotional events.\n\u2022\nOur ability to execute our business strategies effectively.\nOur business is dependent on the general economic conditions in our markets.\nIn general, our sales depend on general economic factors and other conditions that may affect our business, include periods of slow economic growth or recession, political factors including uncertainty in social or fiscal policy, an overly anti-business climate or sentiment, volatility and/or lack of liquidity from time to time in U.S. and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability and/or higher cost of borrowing for us and our customers, increasing fuel and energy costs, inflation or deflation of commodity prices, natural disasters, and acts of terrorism and developments in the war against terrorism. Additionally, any of these circumstances concentrated in a region of the U.S. in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations. General economic conditions and discretionary spending are beyond our control and are affected by, among other things:\n\u2022\nThe housing and home improvement markets.\n\u2022\nGasoline and fuel prices.\n\u2022\nInterest rates and inflation.\n\u2022\nForeign currency exchange rates.\n\u2022\nNatural disasters.\n\u2022\nNational and geopolitical concerns.\n\u2022\nTax rates and tax policy.\n\u2022\nOther matters that influence business confidence and spending.\n\u2022\nCommodity prices.\nVolatility in financial markets may cause some of the above factors to change with an even greater degree of frequency and magnitude. The above factors could result in slowdown in the economy or an uncertain economic outlook, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to hire, train and retain key management, qualified managers, other employees and subcontracted agents, we could have difficulty implementing our business strategy, which may result in reduced net sales, operating margins and profitability.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel as needed in the future, our level of customer service may decline, which may decrease our net sales and profitability. Other factors that impact our ability to maintain sufficient levels of qualified employees and agents in all areas of the business include, but are not limited to, the Company\u2019s reputation, worker morale, the current macroeconomic environment, competition from other employers, and our ability to offer adequate compensation packages. Adverse changes in health care costs could also adversely\nimpact our ability to achieve our operational and financial goals and to offer attractive benefit programs to our employees. Our ability to control labor costs, which may impact our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel, is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates, the impact of legislation or regulations governing healthcare benefits or labor relations and health and other insurance costs. If our labor and/or benefit costs increase, we may not be able to hire or maintain qualified personnel to the extent necessary to execute our competitive strategy, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain statutory, regulatory and legal developments that could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur statutory, regulatory and legal environment exposes us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could materially adversely affect our operations and financial results. The most significant compliance and litigation risks we face are:\n\u2022\nThe difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, state and national jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nThe impact of proposed, new or changing statues and regulations, including, but not limited to, corporate governance matters, environmental impact, financial reform, Health Insurance Portability and Accounting Act, health care reform, labor reform, and/or other as yet unknown legislation that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure.\n\u2022\nThe impact of changes in tax laws (or interpretations thereof by courts and taxing authorities) and accounting standards.\n\u2022\nThe impact of litigation, including class action or individual lawsuits involving shareholders, and labor and employment litigation related matters.\n\u2022\nChanges in trade regulations, currency fluctuations, economic or political instability, natural disasters, public health emergencies and other factors beyond our control may increase the cost of items we purchase or create shortages of these items, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our cost of revenues, or may force us to increase prices, thereby adversely impacting net sales and profitability.\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of some of these proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take or refrain from taking action which, in either case, could adversely affect our operations or reduce our net income. There can be no assurance that any litigation to which we are a party will be resolved in our favor. Any claim that is successfully decided against us may cause us to pay substantial damages, including punitive damages. Additionally, defending against regulatory changes, lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources from other matters which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nSignificant shortages in diesel fuel supply or increases in diesel fuel prices will increase our operating expenses.\nThe price and supply of diesel fuel can fluctuate significantly based on international, political and economic circumstances, as well as other factors outside our control, such as actions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) and other oil and gas producers, regional production patterns, weather conditions and environmental concerns. Our collection and delivery agents need diesel fuel to run a significant portion of our collection and delivery of appliance activities. Supply shortages could substantially increase our operating expenses. Additionally, if fuel prices increase, our direct operating expenses will increase and many of our vendors may raise their prices as a means to offset their rising costs. We may not be able to pass through all of our increased costs to our customers and some contracts prohibit any pass-through of the increased costs.\nOur revenues from recycling and appliance replacement contracts are very difficult to project and the loss or modification of major recycling and appliance replacement contracts could adversely impact our profits.\nOur business is dependent largely upon our ability to obtain new contracts and continue existing contracts for appliance recycling services and appliance replacement programs with utility companies and other sponsors of energy efficiency programs. Contracts with these entities generally have initial terms of one to three years, with renewal options and early termination clauses. However, some contracts are for programs that are non-recurring. Although we continue to respond to utility companies and other sponsors of energy efficiency programs requesting bids for upcoming recycling and replacement services, we are still dependent on certain customers for a large portion of our revenues. The loss or material reduction of business from any of these major customers could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. While we wish to add new recycling and appliance replacement contracts in 2020 and beyond, we cannot assure you that our existing contracts will continue, that they will be sufficiently profitable, that existing customers will continue to use our services at current levels or we will be successful in obtaining new recycling and replacement contracts going forward.\nOur revenues from recycling contracts are subject to seasonal fluctuations and are dependent on the utilities\u2019 advertising and promotional activities for contracts in which we do not provide advertising services.\nIn our business with utility companies, we experience seasonal fluctuations that impact our operating results. Our recycling revenues are generally higher during the second and third calendar quarters and lower in the first and fourth calendar quarters, due largely to the promotional activity schedules of which we have no control in advertising programs managed by the utilities. Our staff communicates client-driven advertising activities internally in an effort to achieve an operational balance. We expect that we will continue to experience such seasonal fluctuations in recycling revenues.\nWe may need new capital to fully execute our growth strategy.\nOur business involves providing comprehensive, integrated appliance recycling and replacement services. This commitment will require a significant continuing investment in capital equipment and leasehold improvements and could require additional investment in real estate.\nOur total capital requirements will depend on, among the other things discussed in this annual report and the number of recycling centers operating during 2020 and thereafter. Currently, we have eleven recycling centers in operation. If our revenues are lower than anticipated, our expenses are higher than anticipated or our line of credit cannot be maintained, we will require additional capital to finance our operations. Even if we are able to maintain our lines of credit, we may need additional equity or other capital in the future. Sources of additional financing, if needed in the future, may include further debt financing or the sale of equity (including the issuance of preferred stock) or other securities. We cannot assure you that any additional sources of financing or new capital will be available to us, available on acceptable terms or permitted by the terms of our current debt agreements. In addition, if we sell additional equity to raise funds, all outstanding shares of common stock will be diluted.\nChanges in governmental regulations relating to our recycling business could increase our costs of operations and adversely affect our business.\nOur appliance recycling centers are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and licensing requirements related to providing turnkey services for energy efficiency programs. These requirements vary by market location and include, for example, laws concerning the management of hazardous materials and the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, which require us to recapture CFC refrigerants from appliances to prevent their release into the atmosphere.\nOur ability to generate revenue from the sale of refrigerants to produce carbon offsets created through the voluntary destruction of ozone-depleting refrigerants could also be adversely affected by governmental regulations as the market develops. Should the federal government mandate the destruction of ozone-depleting refrigerants in the future, we would be required to destroy these substances without the benefit of selling them to generate carbon offsets, which would increase the cost of our operations.\nWe have registered our centers with the EPA as hazardous waste generators and have obtained required licenses from appropriate state and local authorities. We have agreements with approved and licensed hazardous waste\ncompanies for transportation and recycling or disposal of hazardous materials generated through our recycling processes. As is the case with all companies handling hazardous materials, under some circumstances we may be subject to contingent liability. We believe we are in compliance with all government regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials, and we have environmental insurance to mitigate the impact of any potential contingent liability.\nIn addition, changes and proposed changes by the Trump Administration and the head of the EPA indicate that the regulation of the emission of certain gases, commonly referred to as \u201cgreenhouse gases,\u201d and other ozone-depleting substances may be less of a priority. In addition, the Trump Administration and head of the EPA have announced that they intend to rescind or have already rescinded various environmental regulations established and enforced by previous administrations. As a result, further regulatory, legislative and judicial developments are difficult to predict. Even if federal environmental efforts slow, states may continue pursuing new regulations. These changes by the Trump Administration and the EPA, together with other proposed changes, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Technology Business\nGeoTraq has incurred significant operating losses since inception and expects the losses will continue into the future. If the losses continue GeoTraq may have to suspend operations or cease operations.\nGeoTraq has no operating history upon which an evaluation of its future success or failure can be made. GeoTraq has incurred significant operating losses since inception and has limited financial resources to support it until such time that it is able to generate positive cash flow from operations. GeoTraq\u2019s ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon its ability to (i) develop its technology and (ii) generate revenues from its planned business operations. Based upon current plans, GeoTraq expects to continue to incur operating losses in future periods. Failure to generate revenues may cause GeoTraq to suspend or cease operations.\nGeoTraq is in the early stages of development.\nGeoTraq is developing a new technology and may encounter difficulties including unanticipated problems relating to the development and testing of its product, initial and continuing regulatory compliance, vendor manufacturing costs, production and assembly of its product, and the competitive and regulatory environments in which the company intends to operate. It is uncertain, at this stage of its development, if GeoTraq is unable to effectively resolve any such problems, should they occur. If GeoTraq cannot resolve an unanticipated problem, it may be forced to modify or abandon its business plan.\nGeoTraq does not have sufficient funds to complete each phase of its proposed plan of operation and as a result may have to suspend operations.\nEach of the phases of GeoTraq\u2019s plan of operation is limited and restricted by the amount of working capital that GeoTraq has and is able to obtain from the Company, raise from financings, and generate from business operations. Initially, GeoTraq intended to finance its plan of operation with funds from the Company and private loans, and, subsequently, with revenues generated from its business operations\nBased on latest worst-case projections, GeoTraq will not generate revenues and positive cashflows from operations to satisfy its cash requirements for the next 12 months and will be required to obtain the funds from the Company or raise the required funds by way of equity or debt financing. However, these projections do expect that GeoTraq will generate sufficient revenues and cash flows from operations to satisfy its cash requirements within the next couple of years without ARCA funding assistance. Based on this, the likelihood that GeoTraq may have to suspend operations is remote.\nGeoTraq outsources the research and development of its technology, and as a result it is dependent upon those third-party developers to develop our products in a timely and cost-efficient manner while maintaining a minimum level of quality.\nGeoTraq does not have internal manufacturing capabilities and relies on contract manufacturers to manufacture and develop its products. GeoTraq cannot be certain that it will not experience operational difficulties with its future manufacturers, including reductions in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product\nspecifications, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines, increases in manufacturing costs and increased lead times. Additionally, GeoTraq\u2019s future manufacturers may experience disruptions in their manufacturing operations due to equipment breakdowns, labor strikes or shortages, component or material shortages, cost increases or other similar problems. Further, in order to minimize their inventory risk, GeoTraq\u2019s future manufacturers might not order components from third-party suppliers with adequate lead time, thereby impacting its ability to meet demand forecasts. Therefore, if GeoTraq fails to manage its relationship with its manufacturers effectively, or if they experience operational difficulties, GeoTraq\u2019s ability to ship products could be impaired and its competitive position and reputation could be harmed.\nIn the event that GeoTraq receives shipments of products that fail to comply with its technical specifications or that fail to conform to its quality control standards, and it is not able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, GeoTraq risks revenue losses from the inability to sell those products, increased administrative and shipping costs, and lower profitability. Additionally, if defects are not discovered until after customers purchase its products, GeoTraq customers could lose confidence in the technical attributes of its products and its business could be harmed.\nGeoTraq will not control its future contract manufacturers or suppliers, including their labor, environmental or other practices, or require them to comply with a formal code of conduct. However, GeoTraq intends to conduct periodic audits of its contract manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 compliance with applicable laws and good industry practices, these audits may not be frequent or thorough enough to detect non-compliance. A violation of labor, environmental or other laws by its contract manufacturers or suppliers, or a failure of these parties to follow ethical business practices, could lead to negative publicity and harm GeoTraq\u2019s reputation. In addition, GeoTraq may choose to seek alternative manufacturers or suppliers if these violations or failures were to occur. Identifying and qualifying new manufacturers or suppliers can be time consuming and GeoTraq may not be able to substitute suitable alternatives in a timely manner or at an acceptable cost. Other consumer products companies have faced significant criticism for the actions of their manufacturers and suppliers, and GeoTraq could face such criticism as well. Any of these events could adversely affect its brand, harm its reputation, reduce demand for its products and harm its ability to meet demand if it needs to identify alternative manufacturers or suppliers.\nGeoTraq\u2019s success depends on sales and adoption of its technology for asset tracking and theft recovery.\nGeoTraq\u2019s revenue, if any, will be derived from module sales and recurring fees that GeoTraq receives from resellers that support end users who purchase and activate a Mobile IoT product using the company\u2019s technology. Depending on the products created by companies that use its Mobile IoT module, GeoTraq will receive recurring revenue based on the number of activations and ongoing monthly service. GeoTraq\u2019s short term success depends heavily on achieving significantly increased customer adoption of its Technology either through stand alone or integrated products. GeoTraq\u2019s success also depends on achieving widespread deployment of the Technology by attracting and retaining additional manufacturing partners. The use of the Technology will depend on the pricing, quality and features of the Mobile IoT module to be integrated into location-based products which may vary by market, as well as the level of subscriber turnover experienced by cellular subscriptions. If subscriber turnover increases more than management anticipates, GeoTraq\u2019s financial results could be adversely affected.\nCellular service providers on which GeoTraq\u2019s technology is dependent may change the terms by which the technology is used on their networks, which could result in lower revenue and adverse effects on our business.\nIf the cellular service providers on which GeoTraq\u2019s technology is to be used changes the terms of use or eliminates the ability to use products that incorporate GeoTraq\u2019s technology, GeoTraq could lose customers as they would no longer be able to use GeoTraq\u2019s technology in their products. In addition, GeoTraq could be required to change its fee structure to retain customers, which could negatively affect GeoTraq\u2019s gross margins. The cellular service providers may also decide to raise prices, impose usage caps or fees, or discontinue certain application bundles, which could adversely affect end users who use GeoTraq\u2019s technology. If imposed, these pricing changes or usage restrictions could make GeoTraq\u2019s technology less attractive and could result in current end users abandoning GeoTraq\u2019s technology. If end user turnover increased, the number of GeoTraq\u2019s end users and GeoTraq\u2019s revenue would decrease and its business would be harmed.\nGeoTraq\u2019s ability to increase or maintain its customer base and revenue will be impaired if cellular service providers do not allow GeoTraq Technology access to their networks.\nGeoTraq\u2019s technology requires cellular service to operate. The products produced by manufactures will require end users to maintain service with cellular service providers. If cellular service providers do not permit end users to purchase the cellular connectivity the product requires, GeoTraq may have difficulty attracting manufacturing customers because of the lack of, or difficulty in purchasing and provisioning a service plan. If the end user is unable to provide seamless provisioning or the carrier cancels their subscriptions, GeoTraq\u2019s business may be harmed.\nGeoTraq may not be able to enhance its technology to keep pace with technological and market developments or develop new technology in a timely manner or at competitive prices.\nThe market for location-based products and services is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and short product life cycles. To keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasing customer requirements and achieve product acceptance, GeoTraq\u2019s future success depends upon its ability to enhance its current technology and to continue to develop and introduce new technology and enhanced performance features and functionality on a timely basis at competitive prices. GeoTraq\u2019s inability, for technological or other reasons, to enhance, develop, introduce or deliver compelling technology in a timely manner, or at all, in response to changing market conditions, technologies or consumer expectations could have a material adverse effect on GeoTraq\u2019s operating results or could result in its Technology becoming obsolete. GeoTraq\u2019s ability to compete successfully will depend in large measure on its ability to maintain a technically skilled development and engineering team and to adapt to technological changes and advances in the industry, including providing for the continued compatibility of its technology with evolving industry standards and protocols and competitive network operating environments. Development and delivery schedules for newly developed technology are difficult to predict. GeoTraq in the past, and may in the future, fail to deliver new versions of its technology in a timely fashion. If new releases of GeoTraq\u2019s Technology are delayed or not integrated into products upon their initial commercial release, the manufactures may curtail their efforts to market and promote GeoTraq\u2019s technology and may switch to competing products or services, any of which would result in a delay or loss of revenue and could harm GeoTraq\u2019s business. In addition, GeoTraq cannot provide any assurance that the technology it develops will be brought to market as quickly as anticipated or that the technology will achieve broad acceptance among wireless carriers or consumers.\nIf GeoTraq is unable to develop or modify its technology for new customer products, GeoTraq\u2019s revenue growth may be adversely affected and its net income could decline.\nIf GeoTraq does not develop or modify its technology for new products envisioned or introduced by our future customers to increase the number of customer end users who use GeoTraq\u2019s technology, GeoTraq may not be able to increase its revenue in the longer term. GeoTraq\u2019s sales and marketing efforts may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers. If GeoTraq fails to develop or modify its technology to attract new customers and new subscribers or its new Technology is not successful, GeoTraq may be unable to increase its revenue and its operating results may be adversely affected.\nGeoTraq\u2019s business may suffer if it is alleged or determined that its technology or another aspect of its business infringes the intellectual property rights of others.\nThe markets in which GeoTraq competes are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and trade secrets and also by litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Moreover, in recent years, individuals and groups have purchased patents and other intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement to extract settlements from companies like GeoTraq. Also, third parties may make infringement claims against GeoTraq that relate to technology developed and owned by one of its suppliers for which its suppliers may or may not indemnify GeoTraq. Even if GeoTraq is indemnified against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations and determining the scope of these obligations could require additional litigation. Claims of intellectual property infringement against GeoTraq or its suppliers might require GeoTraq to redesign its products, rebrand its services, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting GeoTraq from marketing or selling its products or services. If GeoTraq cannot or does not license the infringed intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, or substitute similar intellectual property from another source, its revenue and operating results could be adversely impacted. Additionally, GeoTraq\u2019s customers, distributors and retailers may not\npurchase its offerings if they are concerned that they may infringe third-party intellectual property rights. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, costly to defend in litigation, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, damage GeoTraq\u2019s reputation and brand and cause it to incur significant expenses. The occurrence of any of these events may have an adverse effect on GeoTraq\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nGeoTraq faces significant competition and failure to successfully compete in the industry with established companies may result in GeoTraq\u2019s inability to continue with its business operations.\nThere are other companies that provide similar products and services. Management expects competition in this market to increase significantly as new companies enter the market and current competitors expand their products and services. GeoTraq\u2019s competitors may develop or offer technology or products that are better than GeoTraq\u2019s or that achieve greater market acceptance. It is also possible that new competitors may emerge and acquire significant market share. Competitive pressures created by any one of these companies, or by GeoTraq\u2019s competitors collectively, could have a negative impact on GeoTraq\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition and as a result, GeoTraq may not be able to continue with its business operations. In addition, if GeoTraq is unable to develop and introduce new or enhanced products and services quickly enough to respond to market or user requirements or to comply with emerging industry standards, or if these products do not achieve market acceptance, GeoTraq may not be able to compete effectively.\nMany of GeoTraq\u2019s competitors have greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, public relations, sales, distribution and other resources than GeoTraq. Some of GeoTraq\u2019s competitors and its potential competitors\u2019 advantages over GeoTraq, either globally or in particular geographic markets, include the following: (a) offering their services at no or low cost to customers; (b) significantly greater revenue and financial resources; (c) stronger brand and consumer recognition regionally or worldwide; (d) the capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of location based technologies and products; (e) access to core technology and intellectual property, including more extensive patent portfolios; (f) access to custom or proprietary content; (g) quicker pace of innovation; (h) stronger wireless carrier relationships; (i) greater resources to make and integrate acquisitions; (j) lower labor and development costs; and (k) broader global distribution and presence.\nGeoTraq products require FCC approval, and possibly approvals from other international and domestic government regulatory agencies, that may not be approved. In addition, our technology could be affected by other existing laws or regulations or future legislative or regulatory changes that may affect our business.\nPrior to the sale by GeoTraq of the Mobile IoT Modules, other than business and operations licenses applicable to most commercial ventures, GeoTraq is not required to obtain any governmental approval for its business operations. In order to sell its Mobile IoT Modules, GeoTraq believes that Part 15b of the FCC rules apply to such sales. GeoTraq employed FCC accredited testing laboratories to verify and certify that the Mobile IoT Modules comply with all regulatory requirements prior to the sale of the Mobile IoT Modules. Such testing confirmed that the Mobile IoT Modules satisfied the requirements of Part 15b of the FCC rules. GeoTraq is taking advantage of a FCC Supplier Declaration of Conformity, or SDOC, allowing the company to rely on the approval given by the FCC to the chipset manufactured by Sequans Communications S.A. (\u201cSequans\u201d). If the FCC withdraws the approval given by it to the Sequans chipset, GeoTraq will be unable to market and sell its products and, as a result, the financial results of GeoTraq and the Company could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if GeoTraq determines to market and sell its products outside of the United States, the regulatory agencies in designated countries may require GeoTraq to submit its products for compliance testing and seek local government regulatory licenses and approvals. It is possible that the company\u2019s products may not successfully complete required compliance tests or that local country regulatory agencies may withhold the issuance of certifications or approval required for GeoTraq to market and sell its products in that country, and, as a result, the financial results of GeoTraq and the Company could be materially and adversely affected.\nGeoTraq may be subject to legal proceedings involving its technology that could result in substantial costs and which could materially harm GeoTraq\u2019s business operations.\nFrom time to time, GeoTraq may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of its business, including claims of alleged infringement of the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by\nGeoTraq. These types of claims could result in increased costs of doing business through legal expenses, adverse judgments or settlements or require GeoTraq to change its business practices in expensive ways. Additional litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce GeoTraq\u2019s technology rights, to protect its trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any litigation, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could materially harm GeoTraq\u2019s business.\nGeoTraq may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of its technology and implementation of its proposed plan of operations.\nGeoTraq\u2019s future success depends largely upon the continued service of its board members, executive officers and other key personnel. GeoTraq\u2019s success also depends on its ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. Key personnel represent a significant asset, and the competition for these personnel is intense in the communications industry.\nGeoTraq may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel in initial phases of its proposed plan of operations. GeoTraq does not maintain key person life insurance on any of its personnel. The loss of one or more of its key employees or its inability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel could negatively impact GeoTraq\u2019s ability to complete any proposed phase of its plan of operations.\nGeoTraq\u2019s management lacks any formal training or experience in offshore manufacturing and supply chain management, and as a result management may make mistakes, which could have a negative impact on GeoTraq\u2019s business operations.\nGeoTraq\u2019s management, led by Pierre Parent, Chief Technology Officer and General Manager, is experienced in researching and developing technology. Management breadth of experience spans product development, sales and business development, project management and the leadership of engineering from concept through manufacturing. As a result, the risk that GeoTraq lacks experience and may have to suspend or cease business operations is remote.\nGeoTraq\u2019s business and products are subject to a variety of additional U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that are central to our business and its failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business or our operating results.\nGeoTraq is or may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to its business, including laws and regulations regarding consumer protection, advertising, privacy, intellectual property, manufacturing, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, and economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions.\nGeoTraq\u2019s modules are subject to regulation by various U.S. state and federal and foreign agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission. If GeoTraq fails to comply with any of these regulations, it could become subject to enforcement actions or the imposition of significant monetary fines, other penalties, or claims, which could harm its operating results or its ability to conduct its business.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur principal shareholders own a large percentage of our voting stock, which will allow them to control substantially all matters requiring shareholder approval.\nCurrently, Isaac Capital Group, LLC and Timothy Matula own approximately 19.7% and 5.7%, respectively, of our outstanding shares of common stock. Three of our current directors are also on the board of directors of Live Ventures Incorporated, a publicly held corporation controlled by Isaac Capital Group, LLC and led by Jon Isaac as its President and Chief Executive Officer. Jon Isaac is the son of our Chief Executive Officer Tony Isaac. Because of such ownership, our principal shareholders may be able to significantly, and possibly adversely, affect our corporate decisions, including the election of the board of directors.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock in the public market and the conversion of shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may negatively affect our stock price.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, and the actual conversion of shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d), which was approved by our shareholders at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders on October 23, 2018, could have a significant negative effect on the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon exercise of outstanding options, the number of shares outstanding of our common stock could increase substantially. This increase, in turn, could dilute future earnings per share, if any, and could depress the market value of our common stock. Dilution and potential dilution, the availability of a large amount of shares for sale and/or that may be issued upon conversion, and the possibility of additional issuances and sales of our common stock, may negatively affect both the trading price and liquidity of our common stock. These sales and the possibility of conversion of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock also might make it more difficult for us to raise capital through the sale of equity securities or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we would deem appropriate.\nThe trading volumes in our common stock are highly variable, which could adversely affect the value and liquidity of your investment in our common stock.\nThere is a limited trading market for our common stock, which is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. Transactions in our common stock may lack the volume and liquidity necessary to maintain an orderly trading market and this could result in both depressed and highly variable trading prices. Sales or issuances of substantial amounts of common stock into the public market, including issuances of shares of common stock upon conversion of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, at the same time could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The trading volume and market price of our common stock could also be adversely affected if we do not maintain our listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nOur stock price may fluctuate and be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations due to the following factors, among others:\n\u2022\nVariations in our financial results.\n\u2022\nChanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance or interpretations.\n\u2022\nSales of substantial amounts of our stock by existing shareholders.\n\u2022\nConversion of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock.\n\u2022\nGeneral economic conditions.\nThese broad fluctuations in the stock markets may also cause the price of our common stock to fall abruptly or remain significantly depressed.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company, including us, following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. Such lawsuits generally result in the diversion of management's time and attention away from business operations, which could harm our business. In addition, the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation, a ruling against us, or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe do not intend to declare dividends on our stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all future earnings, if any, for the operation and expansion of our business and, therefore, do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors, will require approval by our lender and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions\nand other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Therefore, dividend income should not be expected from shares of our common stock.\nThe Nevada Revised Statutes (\u201cNRS\u201d) contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, prevent attempts to replace or remove current management and reduce the market price of our stock.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to two million shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock. As a result, without further stockholder approval, the board of directors has the authority to attach special rights, including voting and dividend rights, to this preferred stock. With these rights, preferred stockholders could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.\nWe are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the NRS. Depending on the number of residents in the state of Nevada who own our shares, we could be subject to the provisions of Sections 78.378 et seq. of the Nevada Revised Statutes which, unless otherwise provided in the Company\u2019s articles of incorporation or by-laws, restricts the ability of an acquiring person to obtain a controlling interest of 20% or more of our voting shares. Our articles of incorporation and by-laws do not contain any provision which would currently keep the change of control restrictions of Section 78.378 from applying to us.\nWe are subject to the provisions of Sections 78.411 et seq. of the Nevada Revised Statutes. In general, this statute prohibits a publicly held Nevada corporation from engaging in a \u201ccombination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the combination or the transaction by which the person became an interested stockholder is approved by the corporation\u2019s board of directors before the person becomes an interested stockholder. After the expiration of the three-year period, the corporation may engage in a combination with an interested stockholder under certain circumstances, including if the combination is approved by the board of directors and/or stockholders in a prescribed manner, or if specified requirements are met regarding consideration. The term \u201ccombination\u201d includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or within three years did own, 10% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock. A Nevada corporation may \u201copt out\u201d from the application of Section 78.411 et seq. through a provision in its articles of incorporation or by-laws. We have not \u201copted out\u201d from the application of this section.", "PERMNO": 77202, "SIC": 4953, "TIC": "JAN"}
