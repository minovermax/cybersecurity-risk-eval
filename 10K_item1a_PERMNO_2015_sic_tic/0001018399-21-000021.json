{"cik": "1018399", "company": "ENTERPRISE BANCORP INC /MA/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nAn investment in the Company's common stock is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties including, without limitation, those set forth below, any of which could cause the Company's actual results to vary materially from recent results or from the other forward-looking statements that the Company may make from time to time in news releases, periodic reports and other written or oral communications. This Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nRealization of any of the risks outlined in the following sections, or additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of, or may currently deem immaterial, may impair the Company's business in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, any one or a combination of the following consequences: loss of assets; an interruption in the ability to conduct business and\nprocess transactions; loss of customer business; loss of key personnel; additional regulatory scrutiny and potential enforcement actions and/or penalties against the Company or the Bank; limit the payment of dividends; damage the Company's reputation; expose the Company to civil litigation and possible financial liability; result in unanticipated charges against capital; increase operational costs; decrease revenue; restrict funding sources, which could adversely impact the Company's ability to meet cash needs; be required to liquidate investments or other assets; limit growth and branch network expansion; close locations or reduce staffing; or limit permissible activities. As a result, the Company's overall business, financial condition, results of operations, capital position, liquidity position, and financial performance could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of the Company's common stock could decline significantly, and stockholders could lose some or all their investment.\nThe material risks and uncertainties that management believes may affect the Company are outlined below. These risks and uncertainties are not listed in any order of priority and are not necessarily the only ones facing the Company.\nRISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS\nRisk Management Controls and Procedures Could Fail or Be Circumvented\nManagement regularly reviews and updates the Company's internal controls, corporate governance policies, compensation policies, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and security controls to prevent and detect errors and potential monetary losses, loss of confidential information and data, and loss of physical assets by theft, wanton destruction or damage, fraud, or robbery from both internal and external sources. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. The Company is at risk of ineffective design of internal controls, any circumvention of the Company's internal controls and procedures, whether intentional or unintentional, or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures, or failure to adequately execute controls and procedures, whether by employees, management, directors, or external elements, or any illegal activity conducted by a Bank customer or employee.\nSee also \u201cRisk Management Framework,\u201d contained above in Item 1, \u201cBusiness,\u201d of this Form 10-K for further information regarding the Company's operational risk management, information security and technology practices, the Company's Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plan and third-party risk management.\nCOVID-19 PANDEMIC\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused continued extensive disruption to the economy, impacted interest rates, increased economic and financial market uncertainty, disrupted global trade and supply chains, and brought about historic unemployment levels. In addition, many state and local governments responded to the pandemic with the temporary closure of brick-and-mortar \"non-essential\" businesses, schools, and limitations on social gatherings, stay-at-home advisories and mandates, and travel bans and restrictions. Although many of these restrictions have eased or been lifted, these restrictions have resulted in significant adverse effects on our customers and business partners, particularly those in the retail, hospitality and food and beverage industries, among many others, including a significant number of layoffs and furloughs of employees nationwide, and in the regions and communities in which we operate. Nationwide attempts to gradually reopen commerce have, in some areas, been met with a resurgence in reported COVID-19 cases, and the decision to scale back on or delay the re-opening of the economy. The phased-in approach to reopen certain parts of the Massachusetts and New Hampshire economies may leave certain types of businesses closed until there is a widespread treatment or comprehensive vaccinations for COVID-19 have prevailed. The long-term consequences of the pandemic experienced by our customers and businesses may further exacerbate some of the risks identified through this \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\" and may also have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as more specifically discussed below.\nPandemic's Impact on Lending & Credit Risks\nThe majority of our loan portfolio consists of commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, and commercial construction loans. Concern over the pandemic has caused and may continue to cause business shutdowns, limitations on commercial activity and financial transactions, labor shortages, supply chain interruptions, increased unemployment, increased commercial property vacancy rates, and the reduced ability for property tenants to make lease payments, all of which may cause our customers to be unable to make scheduled loan payments.\nIf the effects of the pandemic result in widespread and sustained repayment shortfalls on loans in our portfolio, we will incur significant loan delinquencies and non-accrual of interest, which may result in foreclosures and credit losses, particularly if the available collateral is insufficient to cover our exposure. The future effects of the pandemic on economic\nactivity could negatively affect the collateral values associated with our existing loans, the ability to liquidate the real estate collateral securing our commercial real estate and residential loans, our ability to maintain loan origination volume and our ability to obtain additional collateralized funding. Further, in the event of delinquencies, changes in regulations and policies designed to protect borrowers may slow or prevent us from making our business decisions or may result in a delay in our taking certain remedial actions, such as foreclosures. In addition, we have unfunded commitments to extend credit to customers. During a challenging economic environment, our customers may be more dependent on our credit commitments, and any increased borrowings by the Company to fund these commitments could adversely impact our liquidity.\nFurthermore, in an effort to support our communities during the pandemic, we are participating in the SBA's PPP. If the borrower under a PPP loan fails to qualify for loan forgiveness, we are at the heightened risk of (i) holding these loans at unfavorable interest rates, with no collateral and no guarantors, as compared to the credits that we would have otherwise originated; and more so, (ii) if during the remaining loan term of any unforgiven portion of these loans, the borrower defaults and the SBA finds fault and does not honor their loan guarantee, we are at risk for additional credit losses. In addition, a customer perception that their PPP loan forgiveness application was not processed promptly by the Company, or a change or delay in the guidance from the SBA, resulting in the SBA not approving forgiveness, could result in legal action against the Company, negative publicity or public complaints, whether real or perceived, disseminated by word of mouth, by the general media, by electronic or social networking means, or by other methods, which could result in additional expenses, and damage our reputation and adversely affect the market perception of our products and services, among other factors.\nAs allowed by the CARES Act, and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, the Company has suspended TDR accounting for certain loans that have had a short-term payment deferral since March 1, 2020, as long as those loans were current and risk rated as \u201cpass\u201d at December 31, 2019. Although we currently expect that payments will resume after the deferral period has ended, we cannot at this time predict if a borrower\u2019s individual business circumstances, or any prolonged economic weakness after the deferral period has expired, will allow them to support regularly scheduled payments. Consequently, the Company may experience an increase in non-performing assets and the related costs to manage those relationships, and a decline in interest income.\nThe long-term impact of the pandemic on the credit quality of our loan portfolio cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. It will likely be influenced by a variety of factors including the depth and duration of the economic contraction and the extent of financial support and fiscal stimulus by the U.S. government. We will continue to closely monitor the effect of the pandemic on credit quality across all industry sectors in our diversified loan portfolio as the results unfold in future quarters. The credit quality of our loans could be further impacted, and additional provisions may be necessary.\nPandemic's Impact on Economic & Financial Markets Risks\nAt this time, it is unclear how long and to what extent the impact of the pandemic will be felt on the local and regional economy. The majority of businesses in the communities in which we operate, including the Company and its customers, business partners and vendors, have been impacted by these events in a variety of ways and to unprecedented degrees. Depending on the on-going and future developments with respect to the pandemic, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the magnitude of the pandemic, effect of actions taken by governmental authorities, and any further weakening in general economic conditions in our market area, the demand for our financial products and services may be reduced and our business operations, financial results, and stock price could be adversely impacted.\nDue to concerns about the impacts of the pandemic, citing layoffs, plummeting consumer spending and widespread closures, the Federal Reserve Board took action to lower the federal funds target rate range to near-zero, which has and may continue to negatively affect the Company\u2019s net interest income, results of operations and financial condition. A prolonged period of extremely volatile and unstable financial market conditions could increase our funding costs and negatively affect our asset-liability management strategies. Higher volatility in interest rates and spreads to benchmark indices could cause decreases in the fair market values of our investment portfolio, and assets the Company manages for others through our wealth management and trust channels, which would lower fee income, and may impair our ability to attract and retain funds from current and prospective customers. Fluctuations in interest rates will impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities, and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, any of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to fund future growth, our operating results, and financial condition.\nPandemic's Impact on Liquidity Risk\nIf, as a result of governmental or financial market responses to the pandemic, pledged collateral values decline, or sources of external funding become restricted or eliminated, the Company may not be able to raise adequate funds, or may incur substantially higher funding costs in order to raise the necessary funds to support the Company's operations and growth, or may be required to restrict operations or the payment of dividends.\nThe Company\u2019s balance of lower-yielding short-term and overnight investments has increased by loan pay downs and deposit growth which has been positively impacted by proceeds from PPP loans and stimulus checks and by customers proactively building liquidity in response to the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic. As PPP loans are forgiven by the SBA, the Company could see further increases in liquidity.\nThe increase in liquidity has occurred when interest rates are at historically low levels. The immediate impact of carrying high liquidity as short term and overnight investments is a lowering of net interest margin. Investing these funds in the current low rate environment could expose the Company to increased interest rate risk.\nPandemic's Impact on Capital Adequacy Risk\nThe Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank. It receives substantially all its revenue from dividends paid by the Bank. If capital erosion occurs at the Bank, caused by a number of possible negative outcomes from the pandemic, such as an increase in the provisions for loan losses or other credit impairment charges, impairment of goodwill, or a significant decline in earnings, then the Bank may be unable to pay dividends to the Company. The Company in turn will be unable to service its debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital to offset that decline, then regulatory capital ratios for both the Bank and the Company may fall below regulatory minimum adequacy levels, which could restrict the Company's ability to grow, among other operating restrictions, and require the Bank to submit a capital restoration plan under the prompt corrective action regulations.\nPandemic's Impact on Technology & Information Systems, and Operations Risks\nThe spread of the pandemic has also caused the Company, like many other businesses, to modify our business practices, including employee work location and cancellation of, or limitations, on physical participation in meetings, both internally and with business partners, vendors, and customers and prospects, turning instead to working remotely with a dependence on technology and internet connectivity for many communications. Technology and cyber security in customers\u2019 and employees\u2019 homes may not be as robust as in our offices and could cause the available networks, information systems, applications, and other tools to become more limited or less reliable than doing business in our offices. These modifications in business practices, for the Company, customers and vendors, and changes in technology may increase risk, including the circumvention of internal controls and heightened cybersecurity and information systems risk, and may be detrimental to our business operations. Such cyber risks include: greater phishing, malware, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks; vulnerability to disruptions of our information technology infrastructure and telecommunications systems for remote operations; increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of confidential customer information; limited ability to restore the systems in the event of a systems failure, take-over, or interruption; greater risk of a security breach resulting in potential impairment of our ability to perform critical functions; all of which could expose the Company to risks of data or financial loss, litigation and liability and could seriously disrupt our operations and the operations of any impacted business partners and customers, and damage our reputation.\nAdditionally, we rely on many third parties for our business operations, including appraisers of real estate collateral, vendors that supply essential third-party services, information security assessments and technology support services, systems and analytical tools, advisory services, and providers of electronic funds delivery networks and clearing houses, and local and federal government offices, and courthouses used for the recording of mortgages and title work related to loan closings. In light of the evolving measures in response to the pandemic, many of these entities may limit the availability of and access to their services. If third-party service providers continue to have limited capacities for a prolonged period or if additional limitations or potential disruptions in these services materialize, it may negatively affect our business operations and financial results.\nAs noted, the Company has had to modify our business practices, including employee work location, restricting access to branch locations, modifying business development efforts, and limiting physical meetings, both internally and with business partners, vendors, and customers and prospects, turning instead to emphasizing online and mobile banking, drive-up and walk-up banking, and practicing social distancing at all times. Management believes that these alternative arrangements, that were quickly put into action, have been successful to date in allowing us to safely, securely, and fully service our customers\u2019 and communities\u2019 needs and to meet all our business and regulatory banking requirements.\nHowever, these modifications in business practices may not be sustainable over extended periods of time. If wide-spread vaccination is not attained or if more easily spread variants continue to emerge causing further surges in Corona virus cases, branch locations may be unable to open and provide customers with an expected high level of in-person customer service, business development efforts may be reduced or eliminated leading to a decline in growth, and the strong family-oriented culture at the Bank may be weakened.\nLENDING\nThere are inherent risks associated with the Company's lending activities. These risks include, among other things, the impact of changes in the economic conditions in the market areas in which the Company operates and changes in interest rates. In addition, the Company may be impacted by the following risks associated with its lending activities:\nCommercial Lending Generally Involves a Higher Degree of Risk than Retail Residential Mortgage Lending\nThe Company's loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, and commercial construction loans. These types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than owner-occupied residential real estate loans or consumer loans, and typically have larger balances. The underlying commercial real estate values, the actual costs necessary to complete a construction project, or customer cash flow and payment expectations on such loans can be more easily influenced by adverse conditions in the related industries, the real estate market or in the economy in general and are dependent on the skills and experience of the business' management team.\nThe Company May Need to Increase its Allowance for Loan Losses\nThe determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the Company to make significant estimates of current credit risks and non-performing trends, all of which may undergo material changes. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the Company's allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments that may differ from those of the Company's management.\nThe Company expects to adopt the current expected credit losses (\"CECL\") methodology for calculating loan loss reserves in 2021. This methodology utilizes a life of loan concept and allows for reasonable and supportable forecasts. Adoption of CECL is expected to increase the Company's allowance for loan losses.\nSee Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d Item (w) \u201cRecent Accounting Pronouncements,\u201d to the Company's consolidated financial statements, contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K below, under the section \u201cAccounting pronouncements not yet adopted by the Company\u201d for further information regarding Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\u201d\nIncreases in the Company's Non-performing Assets Could Adversely Affect the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition in the Future\nNon-performing assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. No interest income is recorded on non-accrual loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting income and returns on assets and equity. In addition, loan administration and workout costs increase, including significant time commitments from management and staff, resulting in additional reductions of earnings. When taking collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, the Company is required to carry the property or loan at its then-estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell, which, when compared to the carrying value of the loan, may result in a loss. In addition, any errors in documentation or previously unknown defects in deeds may impact the Company's ability to perfect title of the collateral in foreclosure. These non-performing loans and other real estate owned assets also increase the Company's risk profile and the capital that regulators believe is appropriate in light of such risks and have an impact on the Company's FDIC risk-based deposit insurance premium rate.\nThe Company's Use of Appraisals in Deciding Whether to Make a Loan Does Not Ensure the Value of the Collateral\nIn considering whether to make a loan secured by real property or other business assets, the sale of which may provide ultimate recovery of the outstanding balance of the loan, the Company generally requires an internal evaluation or independent appraisal of the collateral supporting the loan. However, these assessment methods are only an estimate of the value of the collateral at the time the assessment is made and involve estimates and assumptions. An error in fact, estimate or judgment could adversely affect the reliability of the valuation. Furthermore, changes in those estimates due to the economic environment and events occurring after the initial assessment, may cause the value of the collateral to differ significantly from the initial valuations. As a result, the value of collateral securing a loan may be less than estimated at the time of assessment, and if a default occurs the Company may not recover the outstanding balance of the loan.\nThe Company is Subject to Environmental Risks Associated with Real Estate Held as Collateral or Occupied\nWhen a borrower defaults on a loan secured by real property, the Company may purchase the property in foreclosure or accept a deed to the property surrendered by the borrower. The Company may also take over the management of commercial properties whose owners have defaulted on loans. The Company also occupies owned and leased premises where branches and other bank facilities are located. While the Company\u2019s lending, foreclosure and facilities policies and guidelines are intended to exclude properties with an unreasonable risk of contamination, hazardous substances could exist on some of the properties that the Company may own, acquire, manage, or occupy. Environmental laws could force the Company to clean up the properties at the Company\u2019s expense. It may cost much more to clean a property than the property is worth, and it may be difficult or impossible to sell contaminated properties. The Company could also be liable for pollution generated by a borrower\u2019s operations if the Company takes a role in managing those operations after a default.\nConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate Loans are Subject to Heightened Risk Management and Regulatory Review\nIf a concentration in commercial real estate lending is present, as measured under government banking regulations, management must employ heightened risk management lending practices that address the following key elements: board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, portfolio risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending. If a concentration is determined to exist, the Company may incur additional operating expenses in order to comply with additional risk management practices and increased capital requirements.\nSee also \u201cLoans,\u201d including the subsections \u201cCredit Risk,\u201d and \u201cAsset Quality,\u201d included in the section entitled \u201cFinancial Condition,\u201d contained in Item 7, \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d of this Form 10-K for further information regarding the Company's commercial loan portfolio and credit risk.\nECONOMICS & FINANCIAL MARKETS\nThe Company's financial results are impacted by the general economic conditions of the primary market areas in which the Company operates. Any weakening in general economic conditions in the New England region, or any long-term deterioration of the regional economy could negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company's Investment Portfolio Could Incur Losses or Fair Value Could Deteriorate\nThere are inherent risks associated with the Company's investment activities. These risks include the impact from changes in interest rates, weakness in real estate, municipalities, government sponsored enterprises, or other industries, the impact of changes in income tax rates on the value of tax-exempt securities, adverse changes in regional or national economic conditions, and general turbulence in domestic and foreign financial markets, among other things. If an investment's value is deemed other-than-temporarily impaired, then the Company is required to write down the fair value of the debt security which may involve a charge to earnings. These conditions could adversely impact the ultimate collectability of the Company's investments.\nThe Company is Subject to Interest Rate Risk\nThe Company's earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income, meaning the difference or spread between interest income earned and interest expense paid. Changes in interest rates could negatively impact the spread and demand for bank products. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company's control, including monetary policy of the U.S. federal government, inflation and deflation, volatility of domestic and global financial markets, including credit markets, and competition.\nUncertainty related to the London Interbank Offer Rate (\"LIBOR\") and its replacement\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced it intends to stop publication of the one week and two month USD LIBOR after December 31, 2021, but continue the publication of the overnight and one, three, six and 12 month USD LIBOR until June 30, 2023. The Federal Reserve Board and the New York Federal Reserve Bank have jointly formed a committee known as the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the \"ARRC\") to help ensure a successful transition from LIBOR. The ARRC has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") as the alternative rate for use in derivatives and other financial contracts currently being indexed to LIBOR. SOFR is a daily index of the interest rate banks and hedge funds pay to borrow money overnight, secured by U.S. Treasury securities.\nA relatively small portion of the Company's assets and liabilities are indexed to LIBOR and the transition to an alternative rate is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's earnings.\nSee also \u201cImpairment Review of Investment Securities,\u201d included in the section entitled \u201cAccounting Policies/Critical Accounting Estimates,\u201d contained in Item 7, \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d of this Form 10-K, Item (d), \u201cRestricted Cash and Investments\u201d and Item (e), \u201cInvestments,\u201d included in Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Account Policies,\u201d to the Company's consolidated financial statements, contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K below. See Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,\u201d of this Form 10-K for further discussions related to the Company's management of interest-rate risk.\nLIQUIDITY\nDeposit Outflows May Increase Reliance on Borrowings and Brokered Deposits as Sources of Funds\nThe Company has traditionally funded asset growth principally through deposits and borrowings. As a general matter, deposits are typically a lower cost source of funds than external wholesale funding (e.g., brokered deposits and borrowed funds), because interest rates paid for deposits are typically less than interest rates charged for wholesale funding. If the balance of the Company's deposits decreases relative to the Company's overall banking operations, the Company may have to rely more heavily on wholesale funding or other sources of external funding or may have to increase deposit rates to maintain deposit levels in the future.\nSources of External Funding Could Become Restricted and Impact the Company's Liquidity\nIf, as a result of general economic conditions or other events, sources of external funding become restricted or are eliminated, the Company may not be able to raise adequate funds, or may incur substantially higher funding costs in order to raise the necessary funds to support the Company's operations and growth, or may be required to restrict operations or the payment of dividends.\nSee also \u201cOther Sources of Funds,\u201d contained in Item 1, \u201cBusiness,\u201d of this Form 10-K and \u201cLiquidity,\u201d included in the section entitled \u201cFinancial Condition,\u201d contained in Item 7, \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d of this Form 10-K for further information regarding the Company's sources of contingent liquidity.\nTECHNOLOGY & INFORMATION SYSTEMS\nThe use of technology related products, services, delivery channels, access points and processes expose the Company to various risks, particularly operational, privacy, cybersecurity, strategic, reputation and compliance risk. Banks are required by regulatory agencies to prudently manage technology-related risks as part of their comprehensive risk management policies by identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling risks associated with the use of technology.\nFailure to Keep Pace with Technological Change Could Affect the Company's Profitability\nThe banking industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products, services, and delivery channels. Failure to successfully plan or keep pace with technological changes affecting the banking industry, or failure to adequately train and educate staff and customers on the use and risks of new technologies, or failure to comply adequately with regulatory guidance regarding protection of information security systems could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and, in turn, the Company's financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there may be significant time and expenses associated with upgrading and implementing new technology, technology compliance and information security processes.\nInformation Systems Could Experience an Interruption, Failure, Breach in Security, or Cyber-Attack\nThe Company relies heavily on public utilities infrastructures and internal information and operating systems to conduct its business, and these systems could fail in a variety of ways. In addition, the use of networked operating systems exposes the Company to the increased sophistication and activity of cyber-criminals. A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the information resources of the Company. These incidents may be an intentional attack or an unintentional event and could involve gaining unauthorized access directly to our information systems, or indirectly through our vendors and customers systems, for purposes of misappropriating assets, stealing confidential corporate information or customers' Personally Identifiable Financial Information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. The Company's independent third-party service providers or their subcontractors may also have access to customers' personal information and therefore also expose the Company to cybersecurity risk. Additionally, vendors' and customers' home, business or mobile information systems are at risk of fraudulent corporate account takeovers which the Company may not be able to detect. There is no guarantee the Company's counteractions will be successful or that the Company will have the resources or technical expertise to anticipate, detect or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks.\nThe occurrence of any failures or disruptions of infrastructure, or breakdown, breach, failures or interruptions of the Company's information systems, access points (or those of third-party service providers and customers), or the Company's inability to detect, respond, disclose and correct such occurrence or infiltration in a timely manner, could result in an interruption in our ability to conduct transactions for an indeterminable length of time, could expose customers' personal information to unauthorized parties, increase the risk of fraud or customer identity theft, subject the Company to increased operational costs to detect and rectify the situation, damage the Company's reputation and deter customers from using the Company's services, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny, and expose the Company to civil litigation and possible financial liability.\nOPERATIONS\nThe Company Operates in a Competitive Industry and Market Area\nThe Company faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors within its market area, see \"Market Area\" and \"Competition\" contained in Item 1, \"Business,\" of this Form 10-K. Some of these competitors are larger and have more financial resources than the Company; some are not subject to the same degree of government regulation as the Company and thus may have a competitive advantage over the Company. If due to the inability to compete successfully within the Company's target banking markets, the Company encounters difficulties attracting and retaining customers it would have a material adverse effect on the Company's growth and profitability.\nThe Company May Experience a Prolonged Interruption in its Ability to Conduct Business\nThe Company relies heavily on its personnel and facilities to conduct its business. A material loss of people or physical damage, destruction, or denial of access to our core operating facilities, for any number of reasons including localized natural disasters or global pandemics, could result in prolonged business interruptions impacting customer services and our ability to conduct transactions.\nThe Company Relies on External Service Providers\nThe Company relies on independent third-party firms, including indirect vendors utilized by such third parties, to provide critical services necessary to conducting its business. These services include but are not limited to: electronic funds delivery networks; check clearing houses; electronic banking services; wealth advisory, management and custodial services; wealth brokerage services; correspondent banking services; information security assessments and technology support services; and loan underwriting and review services. The occurrence of any failures or interruptions of the independent firms' systems or in their delivery of services, or failure to perform in accordance with contracted service level agreements, for any number of reasons could also impact the Company's ability to conduct business and process transactions.\nThe Company Relies on Financial Counterparty Relationships\nThe Company routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, in order to maintain correspondent bank relationships, liquidity, manage certain loan participations, mortgage sales activities, interest-rate swaps, engage in securities transactions, and engage in other financial activities with counterparties that are customary to our industry. Many of these transactions expose the Company to counterparty credit, liquidity and/or reputation risk in the event of default by the counterparty, or negative publicity or public complaints, whether real or perceived, about one or more of the Company's financial counterparties, or the financial services industry in general. Although the Company seeks to manage these risks through internal controls and procedures, the Company may experience loss or interruption of business as a result of unforeseen events with these counterparties.\nInvestment Management Practices and Aggregate Assets Under Management Expose the Company to Financial, Operational and Legal Risk\nThe Company's Enterprise Wealth Management and Enterprise Wealth Services channels derive their revenues primarily from investment management fees based on assets under management. The Company's ability to maintain or increase investment assets under management is subject to a number of factors, including changes in client investment preferences, investment decisions by us or our third-party service provider partners, and various economic conditions, among other factors. Wealth management and wealth services clients can terminate their relationships with us, reduce their aggregate assets under management, or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons.\nInvestment performance is one of the most important factors in retaining existing clients and competing for new wealth management clients. Financial markets are affected by many factors, any of which could adversely impact the fair value of\ncustomer portfolios. Even when market conditions are generally favorable, our investment performance may be adversely affected by the investment style of our wealth management and investment advisors and the investment decisions that they make. Poor investment performance, whether real or perceived, in either relative or absolute terms, could impair our ability to attract and retain investment assets under management from existing and new clients.\nThe Company's Insurance Coverage May Not be Adequate to Prevent Additional Liabilities or Expenses\nThe Company works with an independent third-party insurance advisor to obtain insurance policies that provide coverage for a variety of business risks at coverage levels that compare favorably to bench-marked coverage for loss exposures that are faced by similarly sized financial institutions. However, there are no guarantees that the Company will be able to maintain comparable or adequate coverage levels in the future. In addition, there is no guarantee that the circumstances of an incident will meet the criteria for insurance coverage under a specific policy, and despite the insurance policies in place the Company may experience a material loss incident or event.\nSlower than Expected Growth in New Branches and Products Could Adversely Affect the Company's Profitability\nThe Company has placed a strategic emphasis on expanding the Bank's branch network and market share through organic growth within existing and into neighboring geographic markets. However, in the future the Company could explore growth opportunities through acquisition of other banks, financial services companies, or lines of business. New branches and new products and services require a significant investment of both financial and personnel resources. Lower or slower than expected loan and deposit growth in new branches and/or lower than expected fee or other income generated from new branches could decrease anticipated revenues, increase costs, and reduce net income generated by such investments. Any potential future acquisitions could adversely affect the Company's profitability based on management's ability to successfully complete such acquisitions and integration of the acquired businesses and increase the risk of losing key employees and customers. In addition, branch openings, relocations, and closings require the approval of various state and federal regulatory agencies, which may or may not approve the Company's application for a branch. Adding new branches in existing or new market areas could also divert resources from current core operations.\nThe Company May Not be Able to Attract, Retain or Develop Key Personnel\nThe Company's success and growth strategy depends, in large part, on its ability to attract, retain and develop top performing banking professional within our markets, and its ability to successfully identify and develop personnel for succession to key executive management positions and to the board of directors. The inability to do so could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business because of the loss of their skills, knowledge of the Company's market, years of industry or business experience and the difficulty of promptly hiring qualified replacements.\nSee the section entitled \u201cCompetition,\u201d contained in Item 1, \u201cBusiness,\u201d of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the competitive issues facing the Company.\nREGULATION\nThe Company is Subject to Extensive Government Regulation and Supervision\nThe Company and the Bank are also subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations that are primarily intended to protect depositors' funds, the FDIC insurance fund, and the banking system as a whole, not the interests of stockholders. These regulations, including bank regulatory reform, tax policy and corporate governance rules, affect the Company's lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, growth, and net income, among other things. Federal and state laws and regulations may not always align in principle or statue, and preemptive federal laws may be more or less restrictive than those of a state. The Company cannot predict what legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions.\nSee also the section entitled \u201cSupervision and Regulation,\u201d contained in Item 1, \u201cBusiness,\u201d of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the supervisory and regulatory issues facing the Company and the Bank.\nESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nThe Company's Financial Condition and Results of Operation Rely in Part on Management Estimates and Assumptions\nIn preparing the financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies, estimates and assumptions to be utilized. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and income and expenses for the years then ended. Changes in those estimates resulting from continuing change in the economic environment and other factors will be reflected in the financial statements and results of operations in future periods. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and be adversely affected should the assumptions and estimates used be incorrect or change over time due to changes in circumstances. The three most significant areas in which management applies critical assumptions and estimates are the estimates of the allowance for loan losses, impairment review of investment securities and the impairment review of goodwill.\nThe Net Deferred Tax Assets (\u201cDTAs\u201d) May be Determined to be Unrealizable in Future Periods\nIn making its assessment on the future realizability of net DTAs, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including recent financial operations, projected future taxable income, and recoverable past income tax paid. If in the future, management believes based upon historical and expected future earnings that it is more likely than not that the Company will not generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the DTA balance, then a valuation allowance would be booked against the DTA, with the write down offset to current earnings. Factors beyond management's control can affect future levels of taxable income and there can be no assurances that sufficient taxable income will be generated to fully realize the DTAs in the future.\nSee also \u201cAccounting Policies/Critical Accounting Estimates,\u201d contained in Item 7, \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d of this Form 10-K for further information regarding significant areas that management applies estimates and assumptions and Item (v), \u201cRecent Accounting Pronouncements,\u201d included in Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Account Policies,\u201d to the Company's consolidated financial statements, contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K below.\nREPUTATION & LEGAL\nDamage to the Company's Reputation Could Affect the Company's Profitability and Stockholders' Value\nThe Company is dependent on its reputation within its market area as a trusted and responsible financial company for all aspects of its business with customers, employees, vendors, third-party service providers, and others with whom the Company conducts business or potential future business. Any negative publicity or public complaints, whether real or perceived, disseminated by word of mouth, by the general media, by electronic or social networking means, or by other methods, could harm the Company's reputation.\nFurthermore, investors have begun to consider how corporations are addressing environmental, social and governance matters, commonly known as \"ESG matters\" when making investment decisions. For example, certain investors are beginning to incorporate the business risks of climate change and the adequacy of companies\u2019 responses to climate change and other ESG matters as part of their investment theses. These shifts in investing priorities may result in adverse effects on the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock if investors determine that the Company has not made sufficient progress on ESG matters.\nThe Company is Exposed to Legal Claims and Litigation\nThe Company is subject to legal challenges under a variety of circumstances in the course of its normal business practices. Regardless of the scope or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants, the Company may have to engage in litigation that could be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company's operations, and distracting to management. Whether claims or legal action are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, they may result in significant financial liability, damage the Company's reputation, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny and restrictions, and/or adversely affect the market perception of our products and services, as well as impact customer demand for those products and services.\nCOMMON STOCK, STOCKHOLDER\u2019S EQUITY, CAPITAL\nThe Trading Volume in the Company's Common Stock is Less Than That of Larger Companies\nAlthough the Company's common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market, the trading volume in the\nCompany's common stock is substantially less than that of larger companies. Given the lower trading volume of the Company's common stock, significant purchases or sales of the Company's common stock, or the expectation of such purchases or sales, could cause significant movement in the Company's stock price.\nThe Company's Capital Levels Could Fall Below Regulatory Minimums\nIf the Company's regulatory capital levels decline, or if regulatory requirements increase, and the Company is unable to raise additional capital to offset that decline or meet the increased requirements, then its regulatory capital ratios may fall below regulatory minimum capital adequacy levels.\nThe Company's failure to remain \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d for bank regulatory purposes could affect customer confidence, restrict the Company's ability to grow (both assets and branching activity), increase the Company's costs of funds and FDIC insurance expense, prohibit the Company's ability to pay dividends on common shares, and restrict its ability to make acquisitions, among other impacts. Under FDIC rules, if the Bank ceases to be a \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d institution, its ability to accept brokered deposits and the interest rates that it pays may be restricted. The Basel III Rules establish, among other rules, a \"capital conservation buffer\" of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum risk-based capital requirements. An institution will be subject to limitations on certain activities, including payment of dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers, if its capital level is below the buffered ratio.\nSee also \"Capital Requirements,\" and \"Capital Requirements under Basel III,\" under the heading \"Supervision and Regulation,\" contained in Item 1 above, for further information regarding the Company's and the Bank's regulatory capital requirements.\nThe Company's Articles of Organization, By-Laws and Stockholders Rights Plan as Well as Certain Banking and Corporate Laws Could Have an Anti-Takeover Effect\nAlthough management believes that certain anti-takeover strategies are in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders, provisions of the Company's articles of organization, by-laws, and stockholders rights plan and certain federal and state banking laws and state corporate laws, including regulatory approval requirements for any acquisition of control of the Company, could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire the Company, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to the Company's stockholders. The combination of these provisions is intended to prohibit a non-negotiated merger, or other business combination involving an acquisition of the Company, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of the Company's common stock.\nDirectors and Executive Officers Own a Significant Portion of Common Stock\nThe Company's directors and executive officers, as a group, beneficially own approximately 17% of the Company's outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2020. Management views this ownership commitment by insiders as an integral component of maintaining the Company's local and community-based ownership. However, as a result of this combined ownership interest, the directors and executive officers have the ability, if they vote their shares in a like manner, to significantly influence the outcome of all matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election of directors.\nThe Company Relies on Dividends from the Bank for Substantially All of its Revenue\nHolders of the Company\u2019s common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when, and if declared by our Board. Although the Company has historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so, and our Board may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future.\nThe Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank. It receives substantially all its revenue from dividends paid by the Bank. These dividends are the principal source of funds used to pay dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock and interest and principal on the Company\u2019s subordinated debt. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Company, and certain regulators may prohibit the Bank or the Company from paying future dividends if deemed an unsafe or unsound practice. If the Bank, due to its capital position, inadequate net income levels, or otherwise, is unable to pay dividends to the Company, then the Company will be unable to service its debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nSee the sections entitled \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d and \u201cCapital Resources,\u201d contained in Item 1, \u201cBusiness,\u201d of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements for the Company and the Bank. See also the section entitled \u201cDividends,\u201d contained in Item 5, \u201cMarket for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder\nMatters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\u201d of this Form 10-K below.", "PERMNO": 90590, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "EBTC"}
