{"cik": "788611", "company": "SIGMA LABS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nOur business is subject to numerous risks. We caution you that the following important factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the SEC, press releases or communications with investors and others. Any or all of our statements in this annual report and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. The factors mentioned in the discussion below will be important in determining future results. Consequently, actual future results may vary materially from those anticipated in this annual report or our other public statements.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate an investment in the Company.\nSince we commenced business operations in 2010 and are continuing to develop our technologies and implement our operating tactics, it can be expected that we will continue to incur significant operating expenses and will experience significant losses in the foreseeable future. There is no assurance that any revenues we generate will be sufficient for us to become profitable or thereafter maintain profitability. As a result, the Company cannot predict when, if ever, it might achieve profitability and cannot be certain that it will be able to sustain profitability, if achieved. Our relatively short operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate our business prospects in connection with an investment in our securities.\nWe face many of the risks normally associated with a new business.\nWe face all the risks inherent in a new business, including the expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with conducting new operations and efforts to develop and commercialize technologies. These uncertainties include developing our technologies and our brand name, raising capital to meet our working capital requirements and developing a customer base, among others. If we are not effective in addressing these risks, we will not be able to operate profitably in the future, and we may not have adequate working capital to meet our obligations as they become due.\nWe may not be able to obtain sufficient financing, and may not be able to further develop our technologies.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, along with revenue from our existing contracts, should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least twelve months. This projection is based on our current planned operations and revenue expectations and is subject to changes in our plans and uncertainties inherent in our business, and we may need to seek to replenish our existing cash and cash equivalents sooner than we project. In the future, we will seek to obtain further financing from third parties in order to maintain our operations and to grow our business. We cannot assure that additional funding to maintain our operations will be available to us in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to obtain additional funding when needed, we would be forced to scale back, or terminate, our operations, or to seek to merge with or to be acquired by another company.\nAny additional financing we may undertake could result in dilution to existing stockholders.\nAny additional financings we undertake in the future may be obtained through one or more transactions involving the issuance of our capital stock, which will dilute (either economically or in percentage terms) the ownership interests of our stockholders.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the global economic downturn.\nAny economic downturn generally could cause a drop in government spending and business investment, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, as a result of the current global economic situation, there may be a disruption or delay in performance by the Company\u2019s third-party contractors and suppliers. If such third parties are unable to adequately satisfy their contractual commitments to us in a timely manner, our business could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to hire a chief financial officer, we may be unable to implement and monitor financial controls sufficient to ensure maximum profitability and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.\nWe currently have no Chief Financial Officer (\u201cCFO\u201d) and we may not be in the position to hire a CFO in the near future due to the expense of employing a CFO and our limited capital resources. Monica Yaple is a consultant working as our Treasurer, and she also presently acts as our principal financial and accounting officer. Unless we obtain the services of a qualified CFO, we may be unable to implement and monitor financial controls sufficient to ensure maximum profitability and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.\nWe are not subject to certain reporting requirements under the federal securities laws - accordingly, our stockholders do not have the benefit of certain disclosures prior to voting on material transactions or the benefit of reviewing information regarding our officers\u2019 and directors\u2019 stock ownership and their transactions involving our securities.\nWe are currently subject to SEC reporting requirements under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). Because we have not filed a registration statement under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, we are not subject to the SEC\u2019s proxy rules and related information requirements of the Exchange Act. Further, our officers, directors and stockholders owning 10% or more of our outstanding capital stock are not required to file reports with the SEC concerning their stock ownership and stock trading activity under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, which provides for timely disclosure of insider transactions. Accordingly, our shareholders do not have the benefit of (i) certain disclosures required under the SEC\u2019s proxy rules in connection with their approval of certain corporate actions (e.g., significant acquisitions and election of directors); and (ii) disclosures about our officers\u2019 and directors\u2019 ownership of and their transactions involving the Company\u2019s securities.\nWe could incur significant damages if we are unable to adequately discharge our contractual obligations.\nOur failure to comply with contract requirements or to meet our clients\u2019 performance expectations on a contract could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and our reputation. This, in turn, would impact our ability to compete for new clients and contracts. Our failure to meet contractual obligations could also result in substantial actual and consequential damages under the terms of such contracts. In addition, some of our contracts require us to indemnify clients for our failure to meet performance standards and/or contain liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties related to performance failures. Although we do have liability insurance, the policy limits may not be adequate to provide protection against all such potential liabilities.\nWe have financial exposure on our fixed-price contracts because we are required to complete a project even if the costs exceed the revenues we generate on such fixed-price contract.\nWe presently provide and expect to provide services under fixed-price and performance-based arrangements. Generally, under our fixed-price contracts, we receive a specified fee regardless of our cost to perform under such contracts (compared with performance-based contracts under which we earn fees on a per-transaction basis). If we underestimate the cost to complete a contract, we will still be required to complete the work specified under such contract, which could result in a loss to us. To earn a profit on these fixed-price contracts, we must accurately estimate costs involved and assess the probability of meeting the specified objectives, realizing the expected units of work or completing individual transactions, within the contracted time period. We expect to recognize revenues on these contracts, including a portion of estimated profit, as costs are incurred.\nRequests for Proposals (RFPs) to secure government contracts are time consuming to prepare and our ability to successfully respond to RFPs will impact our operations.\nTo market our services to government clients, we will likely be required to respond to Request for Proposals or \u201cRFPs.\u201d To do so effectively, we must estimate accurately our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract, the time required to establish operations and likely terms of the proposals submitted by competitors. We must also assemble and submit a large volume of information within an RFP\u2019s rigid timetable. Our ability to respond successfully to RFPs will greatly impact our business. There is no assurance that we will be awarded any contracts through the RFP process, or that our submitted RFPs will result in profitable contracts.\nSome of our clients may terminate our contracts prior to completion, which could result in revenue shortfalls and reduce profitability or cause losses on contracts.\nMany of our contracts with clients contain initial or base periods of one or more years, as well as option periods typically covering more than half of the contract\u2019s initial duration. However, such clients are under no obligation to exercise the option to extend the contract term. The profitability of some of our contracts could be adversely impacted if such options are not exercised and the contract term is not extended accordingly. Additionally, our contracts will likely contain provisions permitting a client to terminate the contract on short notice, with or without cause. The unexpected termination of significant contracts could result in significant revenue shortfalls. If revenue shortfalls occur and are not offset by corresponding reductions in expenses, our business could be adversely affected. We cannot anticipate if, when or to what extent a client might terminate its contracts with us.\nWe are subject to government audits and our failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards could subject us to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions.\nThe government agencies we contract with have the authority to audit and investigate our contracts with them. As part of that process, a government agency may review our performance on a contract, our pricing practices, our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. If the agency determines that we have improperly allocated costs to a specific contract, we will not be reimbursed for those costs and we will be required to refund the amount of any such costs that have been previously reimbursed. If a government audit identifies improper activities by us or we otherwise determine that these activities have occurred, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or disqualification from doing business with the government. Any adverse determination could adversely impact our ability to bid for RFPs in one or more jurisdictions.\nUnions may interfere with our ability to obtain contracts.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to win profitable contracts to administer and manage programs that may have been previously administered by government employees. Many government employees, however, belong to labor unions with considerable financial resources and lobbying networks. Unions have in the past and are likely to continue to apply political pressure on legislators and other officials seeking to outsource government programs. Union opposition may result in fewer opportunities for us to service government agencies.\nWe rely on our relationship with government agencies to obtain contracts.\nTo facilitate our ability to prepare bids in response to RFPs, we expect to rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies. These relationships will enable us to provide informal input and advice to the government entities and agencies prior to the development of an RFP. We also expect to engage marketing consultants, including lobbyists, to establish and maintain relationships with elected officials and appointed members of government agencies. The effectiveness of these consultants may be reduced or eliminated if a significant political change occurs. We may be unable to successfully manage our relationships with government entities and agencies and with elected officials and appointees and any failure to do so may adversely affect our ability to bid successfully for RFPs.\nWe have significant competition in bidding for government contracts from large national and international organizations.\nThe government contracting industry is subject to intense competition. Many of our competitors are national and international in scope and have greater resources than we do. Substantial resources could enable certain competitors to \u201clow bid\u201d on government RFPs or take other measures in an effort to gain market share. In addition, we may be unable to compete for a certain large government contract because we may not be able to meet an RFP\u2019s requirement to obtain and post a large cash performance bond. Also, in some geographic areas, we face competition from smaller consulting firms with established reputations and political relationships. There is no assurance that we will compete successfully against our existing or any new competitors.\nWe may not be able to effectively control and manage our growth, which would negatively impact our operations.\nWe have operated our current line of business for a little over six years, and we expect to grow in the near future as our business develops and becomes established. If our business grows as we anticipate, it will be necessary for us to manage our expansion in an orderly fashion. Any significant growth in our activities or in the market for our services will require extension of our managerial, operational, marketing and other resources. Future growth will also impose significant additional responsibilities upon the members of management to identify, recruit, maintain, integrate, and motivate new employees. Our failure to manage growth effectively may lead to operational inefficiencies that will have a negative effect on our profitability. Additionally, if our growth comes at the expense of providing quality service and generating reasonable profits, our ability to successfully bid for contracts and our profitability will be adversely affected. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to effectively manage any future growth we may experience.\nFailure to obtain adequate insurance coverage could put the Company at risk for uninsured losses.\nWe currently have liability insurance. Some or all of the Company\u2019s customers may require insurance as a requirement to conduct business with the Company. We may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate liability insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, and there is a risk that our insurance will not provide adequate coverage against our potential losses. Additionally, there are certain types of losses that may not be insurable at a cost that the Company can afford or at all. Claims or losses in excess of any insurance coverage we may obtain, or the lack of insurance coverage, could put the Company at risk of loss for any uninsured loss, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on our President and Chief Executive Officer, and other key personnel, the loss of which could harm our business.\nThe Company depends on Mark J. Cola, its President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as key scientific and other personnel. The loss of any of these individuals could harm the Company\u2019s business and significantly delay or prevent the achievement of business objectives. In addition, our delivery of services will be labor-intensive: when the Company is awarded a contract, we may need to quickly hire project leaders and project management personnel. The additional staff may also create a concurrent demand for increased administrative personnel. The success of our business will require that we attract, develop, motivate and retain:\n\u00b7 experienced and innovative executive officers;\n\u00b7 senior managers who have successfully managed or designed programs in the public sector; and\n\u00b7 Information technology professionals who have designed or implemented complex information technology projects\nInnovative, experienced and technically proficient individuals are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource. We may be unable to continue to attract and retain desirable executive officers, senior managers, and technology professionals. Our inability to hire sufficient personnel on a timely basis or the loss of significant numbers of executive officers and senior managers could adversely affect our business.\nBecause we have limited capital resources, we may be dependent on cash flow and payments from customers in order to meet our expense obligations.\nA number of factors may cause our revenues, cash flow and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter, including the following:\n\u00b7 the progression of contracts;\n\u00b7 the levels of revenues earned on fixed-price and performance-based contracts (including any adjustments in expectations for revenue recognition on fixed-price contracts);\n\u00b7 the commencement, completion or termination of contracts during any particular quarter;\n\u00b7 the schedules of government agencies and large multinational corporations for awarding contracts;\n\u00b7 the failure of our customers to fulfill their obligations under contracts with us; and\n\u00b7 the term of awarded contracts and potential acquisitions.\nChanges in the volume of activity and the number of contracts commenced, completed or terminated during any quarter may cause significant variations in our cash flow from operations because a significant portion of our expenses are fixed. Fixed expenses include, rent, payroll, insurance, employee benefits, taxes and other administrative costs and overhead. Moreover, we expect to incur significant operating expenses during the start-up and early stages of large contracts and typically do not receive corresponding payments in that same quarter.\nWe may make acquisitions in the future that we are unable to effectively manage given our limited resources.\nWe may choose to grow our business by acquiring other entities. We may be unable to manage businesses that we have acquired or integrate them successfully without incurring substantial expenses, delays or other problems that could negatively impact our results of operations. Moreover, business combinations involve additional risks, including:\n\u00b7 diversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u00b7 loss of key personnel;\n\u00b7 our becoming significantly leveraged as a result of the incurrence of debt to finance an acquisition;\n\u00b7 assumption of unanticipated legal or financial liabilities;\n\u00b7 unanticipated operating, accounting or management difficulties in connection with the acquired entities;\n\u00b7 amortization of acquired intangible assets, including goodwill; and\n\u00b7 dilution to existing shareholders and our earnings per share.\nAlso, client dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired firm could materially and adversely affect our reputation as a whole. Further, the acquired businesses may not achieve the revenues and earnings we anticipated.\nThe Company must keep up with new and rapidly evolving technologies.\nMany of the Company\u2019s activities involve developing products or processes that are based upon new, rapidly evolving technologies. The ability to commercialize or further develop these technologies could fail for a variety of reasons, both within and outside of the Company\u2019s control.\nOur success depends upon our ability to protect our intellectual property rights.\nOur success in part depends on the Company\u2019s ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology and other trade secrets. To do so, we will be required to prosecute and maintain patents, obtain new patents and pursue trade secret and other intellectual property protection. We were awarded two U.S. patents with respect to our munitions technology. We were also awarded a U.S. patent with respect to our IPQA\u00ae technology. In addition, we filed eight patent applications pertaining to our IPQA\u00ae technology and rapid qualification of additive manufacturing for metal parts. Also, we filed a PCT patent application pertaining to the advanced dental implant technology. However, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Our business is also subject to the risk that our issued patents will not provide us with significant competitive advantages if, for example, a competitor were to independently develop or obtain similar or superior technologies. Prosecuting infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent owned by us is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that the Company\u2019s patents do not cover its technology. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put the Company\u2019s patent applications at the risk of not issuing. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. The unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.\nWe may be sued by third parties who claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights.\nWe may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our research, development and commercialization activities infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties to which the Company does not hold licenses or other rights, or that we have misappropriated the trade secrets of others. Any litigation or claims against us, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial and human resources. In addition, if successful, such claims could cause the Company to pay substantial damages. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nOur services are subject to government regulation, changes in which may have an adverse effect on the Company.\nOur business activities subject us to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations. For example, we would be required to comply with applicable provisions of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, as well as other export controls and laws governing the manufacture and distribution of munitions technology. Despite the fact that Sigma has applied for and received ITAR compliance, changes in the laws and regulations applicable to our business activities may have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability by making it more expensive and less profitable for us to do business. Additionally, the market for our services depends largely on federal and state legislative programs. These programs can be modified or amended at any time by acts of federal and state governments. Further, if additional programs are not proposed or enacted, or if previously enacted programs are challenged, repealed or invalidated, our growth strategy could be adversely impacted.\nOur Bylaws contain provisions indemnifying our officers and directors against all costs, charges, and expenses incurred by them.\nOur Bylaws contain provisions with respect to the indemnification of our officers and directors against all costs, charges, and expenses, including an amount paid to settle an action or satisfy a judgment, actually and reasonably incurred by an officer or director, including an amount paid to settle an action or satisfy a judgment in a civil, criminal, or administrative action or proceeding to which he is made a party by reason of being or having been one of our directors or officers.\nOur Bylaws do not contain anti-takeover provisions, which could result in a change of our management and directors if there is a takeover of us.\nWe do not currently have a shareholder rights plan or any anti-takeover provisions in our Bylaws. Without any anti-takeover provisions, there is no deterrent for a takeover of our company, which may result in a change in our management and directors.\nOur operating costs could be higher than we expect, and this could reduce our future profitability.\nIn addition to general economic conditions, market fluctuations and international risks, significant increases in operating, development and implementation costs could adversely affect our company due to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss.\nBusinesses have become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have increased. A cyber attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption or result in denial of service on websites. We depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure, to process and record financial and operating data, and communicate with our employees and business partners. Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business partners may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. Although to date we have not experienced any losses relating to cyber attacks, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe do not foresee paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future and, as a result, our investors\u2019 sole source of gain, if any, will depend on capital appreciation, if any.\nWe do not plan to declare or pay any cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, investors should not rely on an investment in our securities if they require the investment to produce dividend income. Capital appreciation, if any, of our shares may be investors\u2019 sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nOur securities are considered highly speculative.\nOur securities must be considered highly speculative, generally because of our limited operating history. We have neither generated any material revenues nor have we realized a profit from our operations to date and there is no assurance that we will operate on a profitable basis. Since we have not generated any material revenues, we expect that we will need to raise additional monies through the sale of our equity securities or debt in order to continue our business operations.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has exhibited substantial volatility. Between January 1, 2015 and March 16, 2016, the sale price of our common stock as reported on the OTCQB ranged from a low of $0.0401 to a high of $0.125. The market price of our common stock could continue to fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including the following factors:\n\u00b7 announcements of regulatory developments or technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 announcements of business or strategic transactions;\n\u00b7 changes in our relationship with our strategic partners;\n\u00b7 our quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7 developments in patent or other technology ownership rights;\n\u00b7 additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us and, in the case of equity financings, may result in dilution to our stockholders; and\n\u00b7 general changes in the economy, the financial markets or the industry in which we operate.\nIn addition, factors beyond our control may also have an impact on the price of our common stock. For example, to the extent that other large companies within our industry experience declines in their stock price, our stock price may decline as well. In addition, when the market price of a company\u2019s common stock drops significantly, security holders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company. A lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources.\nOffers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nIf our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market upon the expiration of any statutory holding period, under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, or otherwise, it could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an \u201coverhang\u201d and in anticipation of which the market price of our common stock could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make more difficult our ability to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nWe may issue preferred stock in the future, and the terms of the preferred stock may reduce the value of our common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. Our board of directors may determine the terms of future preferred stock offerings without further action by our stockholders. If we issue preferred stock, it could affect your rights or reduce the market value of our outstanding common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, sinking fund provisions, and restrictions on our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party.\nOur common stock may be considered a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d and thereby be subject to additional sale and trading regulations that may make it more difficult to sell.\nOur common stock may be a \u201cpenny stock\u201d if it meets one or more of the following conditions (i) the stock trades at a price less than $5.00 per share; (ii) it is not traded on a \u201crecognized\u201d national exchange; (iii) it is not quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or even if so, has a price less than $5.00 per share; or (iv) is issued by a company that has been in business less than three years with net tangible assets less than $5 million.\nThe principal result or effect of being designated a \u201cpenny stock\u201d is that securities broker-dealers participating in sales of our common stock will be subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d regulations set forth in Rules 15-2 through 15g-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. For example, Rule 15g-2 requires broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document at least two business days before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investor\u2019s account. Moreover, Rule 15g-9 requires broker-dealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in such stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor. This procedure requires the broker-dealer to (i) obtain from the investor information concerning his or her financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives; (ii) reasonably determine, based on that information, that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for the investor and that the investor has sufficient knowledge and experience as to be reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of penny stock transactions; (iii) provide the investor with a written statement setting forth the basis on which the broker-dealer made the determination in (ii) above; and (iv) receive a signed and dated copy of such statement from the investor, confirming that it accurately reflects the investor\u2019s financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives. Compliance with these requirements may make it more difficult and time consuming for holders of our common stock to resell their shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them in the market or otherwise.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports or publish unfavorable research about our business, the price and trading volume of our common stock could decline.\nThe future trading market for our common stock will be influenced in part by any research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us the trading price for our common stock and other securities would be negatively affected. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our securities, the price of our securities would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to publish regular reports on us, interest in the purchase of our securities could decrease, which could cause the price of our common stock and other securities and their trading volume to decline.\nIf we are deemed to be an issuer of \u201cpenny stock\u201d, the protection provided by the federal securities laws relating to forward-looking statements will not apply to us.\nAlthough federal securities laws provide a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by a public company that files reports under the federal securities laws, this safe harbor is not available to issuers of penny stocks. As a result, if we are a penny stock, we will not have the benefit of this safe harbor protection in the event of any legal action based upon a claim that the material provided by us contained a material misstatement of fact or was misleading in any material respect because of our failure to include any statements necessary to make the statements not misleading. Such an action could hurt our financial condition.\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our common stock.\nFINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.\nWe may incur significant costs to ensure compliance with U.S. corporate governance and accounting requirements.\nWe may incur significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements, costs associated with applicable corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and other rules implemented by the SEC. We expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly. We also expect that these applicable rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, the price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nAs a public reporting company, we are required to establish and maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting. Failure to establish those controls, or any failure of those controls once established, could adversely impact our public disclosures regarding our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any failure of these controls could also prevent us from maintaining accurate accounting records and discovering accounting errors and financial frauds.\nRules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require annual assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal control over financial reporting as effective are complex, and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. We may encounter problems or delays in completing activities necessary to make an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. If we cannot assess our internal control over financial reporting as effective, investor confidence and share value may be negatively impacted. In addition, management\u2019s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting may identify weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal controls over financial reporting or other matters that may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting (including those weaknesses identified in our periodic reports), or disclosure of management\u2019s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nObtaining additional capital through the sale of common stock will result in dilution of equity interests.\nWe plan to raise additional funds in the future by issuing additional shares of common stock or other securities, which may include securities such as convertible debentures, warrants or preferred stock that are convertible into common stock. Any such sale of common stock or other securities will lead to further dilution of the equity ownership of existing holders of our common stock. Additionally, the existing options, warrants and conversion rights may hinder future equity offerings, and the exercise of those options, warrants and conversion rights may have an adverse effect on the value of our stock. If any such options, warrants or conversion rights are exercised at a price below the then current market price of our shares, then the market price of our stock could decrease upon the sale of such additional securities. Further, if any such options, warrants or conversion rights are exercised at a price below the price at which any particular shareholder purchased shares, then that particular shareholder will experience dilution in his or her investment.", "PERMNO": 16594, "SIC": 8731, "TIC": "SGLB"}
