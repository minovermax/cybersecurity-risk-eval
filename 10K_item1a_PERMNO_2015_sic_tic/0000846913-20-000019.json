They are as follows:\n\u2022\nThe Air Pollution Control technology segment includes technologies to reduce NOx emissions in flue gas from boilers, incinerators, furnaces and other stationary combustion sources. These include Low and Ultra Low NOx Burners (LNB and ULNB), Over-Fire Air (OFA) systems, NOxOUT\u00ae and HERT\u2122 Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) systems, and Advanced Selective Catalytic Reduction (ASCR\u2122) systems. The ASCR system includes ULNB, OFA, and SNCR components, along with a downsized SCR catalyst, Ammonia Injection Grid (AIG), and Graduated Straightening Grid (GSG\u2122) systems to provide high NOx reductions at significantly lower capital and operating costs than conventional SCR systems. The NOxOUT CASCADE\u00ae and NOxOUT-SCR\u00ae processes are basic types of ASCR systems, using just SNCR and SCR catalyst components. ULTRA\u00ae technology creates ammonia at a plant site using safe urea for use with any SCR application. ESP technologies make use of electrostatic precipitator products and services to reduce particulate matter. Flue Gas Conditioning systems are chemical injection systems offered in markets outside the U.S. and Canada to enhance electrostatic precipitator and fabric filter performance in controlling particulate emissions.\n\u2022\nThe FUEL CHEM\u00ae technology segment which uses chemical processes in combination with advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Chemical Kinetics Modeling (CKM) boiler modeling for the control of slagging, fouling, corrosion, opacity and other sulfur trioxide-related issues in furnaces and boilers through the addition of chemicals into the furnace using TIFI\u00ae Targeted In-Furnace Injection\u2122 technology.\nAn adverse development in our advanced engineering solution business as a result of competition, technological change, government regulation, customers converting to use natural gas or other fuels, or any other factor could have a significantly greater impact than if we maintained more diverse operations.\nWe Face Substantial Competition\nCompetition in the Air Pollution Control market comes from competitors utilizing their own NOx reduction processes, including SNCR systems, Low NOx Burners, Over-Fire Air systems, flue gas recirculation, ammonia SNCR and SCR, which do not infringe our patented technologies. Indirect competition will also arise from business practices such as the purchase rather than the generation of electricity, fuel switching, closure or de-rating of units, and sale or trade of pollution credits and emission allowances. Utilization by customers of such processes or business practices or combinations thereof may adversely affect our pricing and participation in the NOx control market if customers elect to comply with regulations by methods other than the purchase of our Air Pollution Control products. See Item 1 \u201cProducts\u201d and \u201cAPC Competition\u201d in the Air Pollution Control segment overview.\nCompetition for our FUEL CHEM markets include chemicals sold by specialty chemical companies, such as Imerys, Environmental Energy Services, Inc., and SUEZ Water Technologies.\nDemand for Our APC and FUEL CHEM Products is Affected by External Market Factors\nReduced coal-fired electricity demand across the United States has led to coal-fired electricity production declines. Contributing to this decline in coal-fired generations were 1) lower natural gas prices which allowed utility operators to increase the amount of power generated from natural gas plants, 2) increased cost of environmental compliance with current environmental regulations, 3) constrained funding for capital projects, and 4) the uncertainty of regulation resulted in electricity generating unit operators delaying investment in NOx emission remediation plans until such time as the United States Environmental Protection Agency further clarifies the regulations.\nOur Business Is Dependent on Continuing Air Pollution Control Regulations and Enforcement\nOur business is significantly impacted by and dependent upon the regulatory environment surrounding the electricity generation market. Our business will be adversely impacted to the extent that regulations are repealed or amended to significantly reduce the level of required NOx reduction, or to the extent that regulatory authorities delay or otherwise minimize enforcement of existing laws. Additionally, long-term changes in environmental regulation that threaten or preclude the use of coal or other fossil fuels as a primary fuel source for electricity production which result in the reduction or closure of a significant number of fossil fuel-fired power plants may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Item 1 above under the caption \u201cRegulations and Markets\u201d in the Air Pollution Control segment overview.\nWe May Not Be Able to Successfully Protect our Patents and Proprietary Rights\nWe hold licenses to or own a number of patents for our products and processes. In addition, we also have numerous patent applications pending both in the U.S. and abroad. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will be granted or that our outstanding patents will not be challenged, overturned or otherwise circumvented by competitors. In foreign markets, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for our patent rights in emerging markets. In addition, certain critical technical information relating to our products which is not patented is held as trade secret, and protected by trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure contained in our confidentiality and licensing agreements. There can be no assurance that such protections will prove adequate or that we will have adequate remedies against contractual counterparties for disclosure of our trade secrets or other violations of our intellectual property rights. See Item 1 above under the caption \u201cIntellectual Property.\u201d\nOur Results May Be Affected By Foreign Operations\nWe currently have foreign operations predominantly in Europe with our offices located in Gallarate, Italy. The future business opportunities in this market are dependent on the continued implementation and enforcement of regulatory policies that will benefit our technologies, the acceptance of our engineering solutions in such markets, the ability of potential customers to utilize our technologies on a competitive, cost-effective basis, and our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.\nOn January 17, 2019, we announced the suspension of further business development activity for its Air Pollution Control operation in Beijing, China. Our future financial results will be impacted by our ability to successfully complete the remaining wind-down activities in Beijing during 2020.\nIn 2012, we expanded our operations in Latin and South America by establishing a wholly-owned subsidiary in Chile. We are in the process of successfully completing the closure of this subsidiary in Chile during 2020 given all of our existing Air Pollution Control operations are now complete.\nOur Operating Results May Be Adversely Affected by Product Pricing\nThe onset of significant competition for either of the technology segments might require us to lower our product prices in order to remain competitive and have a corresponding adverse impact on our realized gross margins and operating profitability. See the risk factor entitled \u201cWe Face Substantial Competition\u201d above.\nWe May Not Be Able to Purchase Raw Materials on Commercially Advantageous Terms\nOur FUEL CHEM technology segment is dependent, in part, upon a supply of magnesium hydroxide. Any adverse changes in the availability of this chemical will likely have an adverse impact on ongoing operation of our FUEL CHEM programs. On March 4, 2009, we entered into a Restated Product Supply Agreement (\u201cPSA\u201d) with Martin Marietta Magnesia Specialties, LLC (MMMS) in order to assure the continuance of a stable supply from MMMS of magnesium hydroxide products for our requirements in the United States and Canada. The term of the PSA expires on December 31, 2021. Pursuant to the PSA, MMMS supplies us\nwith magnesium hydroxide products manufactured pursuant to our specifications and we have agreed to purchase from MMMS, and MMMS has agreed to supply, 100% of our requirements for such magnesium hydroxide products for our customers who purchase such products for delivery in the United States and Canada. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain a stable source of magnesium hydroxide in markets outside the United States.\nOur Customer Base Is Highly Concentrated\nA small number of customers have historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenues. There can be no assurance that our current customers will continue to place orders, that orders by existing customers will continue at the levels of previous periods, or that we will be able to obtain orders from new customers. The loss of one or more of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results.\nAn outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as the coronavirus, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, operating results and financial condition.\nAn outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, or fear of such an event, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") was reported in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 to constitute a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern.\" Since we are in the process of suspending our operations in Beijing, China and have current operations in Gallarate, Italy, the impact of COVID-19 could have a significant impact in being able to conduct business in those geographies which could affect the Company's operational and financial performance.", "PERMNO": 79586, "SIC": 3569, "TIC": "FTEK"}
