{"cik": "27996", "company": "DELUXE CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business, consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected by various risks and uncertainties. These risks include, but are not limited to, the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have disclosed all known material risks. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. You should carefully consider all of these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock or other securities.\nThe following important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the statements we make from time to time regarding our expected future results, including, but not limited to, forecasts regarding estimated total revenue, marketing solutions and other services revenue, earnings per share, cash provided by operating activities and expected cost savings. Any forecast regarding our future performance reflects various assumptions that are subject to significant uncertainties and, as a matter of course, may prove to be incorrect. Further, the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous factors that are beyond our control. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and the variation of actual results or events from such statements may be material and adverse. You are cautioned not to base your entire analysis of our business and prospects upon isolated statements, and are encouraged to use the entire mix of historical and forward-looking information made available by us, and other information affecting us and our products and services, including the following factors.\nWe may not be successful at implementing our growth strategies.\nWe continue to execute strategies intended to drive sustained revenue and earnings growth, including our focus on increasing marketing solutions and other services revenue, which we believe represents our most significant revenue growth opportunity. We have invested and plan to continue investing in several key enablers to achieve our strategies, including strengthening our portfolio of products and services, including technology-based solutions: enhancing brand awareness and positioning; attracting and retaining customers; growing our distributor, dealer and major accounts networks; improving the customer experience; and investing in small to medium-sized acquisitions. Our business strategies could fall short of our expectations for many reasons, including, among others:\n\u2022\nthe failure to generate profitable revenue growth;\n\u2022\nthe failure to acquire new customers, retain our current customers and sell more products and services to current and new customers;\n\u2022\nthe failure to effectively integrate or leverage the businesses we acquire;\n\u2022\nthe failure of our digital services and products to achieve widespread customer acceptance;\n\u2022\nthe inability to promote, strengthen and protect our brand;\n\u2022\nthe inability to implement improvements to our customer-facing technology in a timely manner; and\n\u2022\na continued challenging economic environment.\nWe can provide no assurance that our growth strategies will be successful either in the short-term or in the long-term, that they will generate a positive return on our investment, or that they will not reduce our operating margins. Additionally, if our strategies are not successful, or if there is market perception that our strategies are not successful, our reputation and brand may be damaged and our stock price may decline.\nWe face intense competition in all areas of our business, and we expect that competition will continue to increase.\nAlthough we are one of the leading check printers in the United States, we face considerable competition. In addition to competition from alternative payment methods, we also face intense competition from another large check printer in our traditional financial institution sales channel, from direct mail and internet-based sellers of personal and business checks, from check printing software vendors and from some retailers. The markets for small business and financial services products and services are also intensely competitive, highly fragmented and geographically dispersed. Current and potential Small Business\nServices competitors include traditional storefront printing companies; office superstores; companies offering website design and hosting; wholesale printers; online printing companies; email and social media marketing services companies; media directory providers; and suppliers of custom apparel, promotional products and customized gifts. Current and potential Financial Services competitors include financial institution core processors, advertising agencies, providers of data and analytics marketing solutions, and numerous financial technology services providers offering services such as core data processing solutions, customer and account acquisition, fraud and security risk management, as well as rewards and loyalty solutions. Additionally, the competitive landscape for e-commerce continues to be challenging as new internet businesses are introduced and traditional businesses establish an online presence.\nWe can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. In recent years, our revenue has benefited from price increases in all three of our business segments. Pricing is becoming more competitive for small business product and service providers, as the internet allows customers to easily compare prices. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to increase prices in the future while remaining competitive. Continued competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of customers and brand recognition, and an increase in up-front cash payments to financial institutions upon contract execution or renewal, all of which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe check printing and related products portion of the payments industry is mature, and check usage is declining.\nCheck printing continues to be an essential part of our business. Revenue generated by the sale of checks was 49.3% of our consolidated revenue in 2015. We sell checks for personal and small business use and believe that there will continue to be a substantial demand for these checks for the foreseeable future. However, the total number of checks written in the United States has been in decline since the mid-1990's. According to the most recent Federal Reserve study released in December 2013, the total number of checks written declined 8.8% each year between 2009 and 2012. We believe that the number of checks written will continue to decline due to the increasing use of alternative payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, direct deposit, wire transfers and internet-based bill paying services, as well as automated teller machines, which make cash a more readily available alternative. In addition, steps have been taken in the development of a real-time payments system in the United States. In January 2015, the Federal Reserve published Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System, which calls on stakeholders to join together to improve the payment system, including developing a faster electronic solution for making a broad variety of business and personal payments. As a result, the Faster Payments Task Force was established with the objective of identifying and evaluating approaches for implementing a faster payments system. The Clearing House Payments Company, LLC (TCH), owned by some of the world's largest commercial banks, has announced that it is moving ahead with concrete plans for a real-time payments system. It has entered into a letter of intent with a United Kingdom-based international payment systems provider to help build and deliver core elements of the real-time payments network and has partnered with a domestic banking technology provider to leverage its existing relationships and key components of its payments technologies. While TCH has not specified a delivery date for the system, the company did state that it would take far less time than the 10 years the Federal Reserve once suggested as a possible timetable. A related study commissioned by the Federal Reserve from McKinsey & Company concluded that check usage could be reduced by one-third if a real-time payments system were to become widely available in the United States.\nThe rate and the extent to which alternative payment methods will achieve acceptance and replace checks, whether as a result of legislative developments, changing payment systems, personal preference or otherwise, cannot be predicted with certainty. A surge in the popularity of any of these alternative payment methods, or our inability to successfully offset the decline in check usage with other sources of revenue, would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nSmall Business Services' standardized business forms and related products face technological obsolescence and changing customer preferences.\nRevenue generated by the sale of business forms was 12.2% of our consolidated revenue in 2015. Continual technological improvements have provided small business customers with alternative means to enact and record business transactions. For example, because of the lower price and higher performance capabilities of personal computers, printers and mobile devices, small businesses now have alternate means to print many business forms. Additionally, electronic transaction systems, off-the-shelf business software applications, web-based solutions and mobile applications have been designed to replace pre-printed business forms. It is difficult to predict the pace at which these alternative products and services will gain widespread acceptance. If small business preferences change rapidly and we are unable to develop new products and services with comparable operating margins, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to attract customers in a cost effective manner, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe use a variety of methods to promote our products and services, including direct mail advertising, email marketing, purchased search results from online search engines, broadcast media, and advertising banners, social media and other online links. The profitability of our Direct Checks segment depends in large part on our ability to secure adequate advertising media placements at acceptable rates. We can provide no assurance regarding the future cost, effectiveness and/or availability of suitable advertising media. Additionally, our Direct Checks segment and portions of our Small Business Services segment have,\nat times, experienced declines in response rates related to direct mail promotional materials. While we believe that media response rates have declined across a wide variety of products and services, we believe that the declines we have experienced are also attributable to the decline in check usage, the gradual obsolescence of standardized forms products and increasing use of e-commerce by both consumers and small businesses. In an attempt to offset these impacts, we continually modify our marketing and sales efforts and continue to shift a greater portion of our advertising investment to the internet. Competitive pressure may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the prices of our products and new marketing strategies may not be successful. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to offset a decline in response rates, even with additional marketing and sales efforts.\nIn addition to print and email advertising, many customers come to our websites through internet search engines. If the search engines on which we rely modify their algorithms or terminate their relationship with us, fewer customers may be directed to our websites. As we analyze our overall advertising strategy, we may have to resort to more costly resources to replace lost internet traffic, which would adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the cost of purchased search engine listings will likely increase as demand for them continues to grow, and further cost increases could negatively affect our profitability.\nWe believe we must maintain a relevant, multichannel experience for our customers. Customers expect to be able to order products and services from us however they please, whether that is via the mail, land-line phone, computer, tablet or mobile phone. In particular, the use of smart phones and tablet computing devices has been increasing significantly. The Internet Trends Report published in June 2015 by Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers (KPBC) indicated that mobile devices are now used more than desktops and laptops to access the internet. As current and potential customers increase their use of mobile devices, visits to our websites via traditional computers may decline. Designing and purchasing custom products on mobile devices is more difficult than doing so with a traditional computer due to limited screen sizes and bandwidth. Beyond these difficulties, the development of mobile-oriented user interfaces and other technologies is complex. We are also dependent on the functionality of our systems with web browsers that we do not control. Although we are constantly making investments to update our technology, we cannot predict the success of these investments. Multichannel marketing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with the changing expectations of our customers and new developments by our competitors. If we are unable to implement improvements to our customer-facing technology in a timely manner, or if our customer-facing technology does not function as designed, we could find it increasingly difficult to attract new and repeat visitors to our websites and convert these visitors to customers, which would result in decreased revenue.\nWe may not succeed in promoting and strengthening our brand, which could prevent us from acquiring customers and increasing revenue.\nThe success of Small Business Services depends, in part, on our ability to attract new and repeat customers. For this reason, a component of our business strategy is the promotion and strengthening of the Deluxe brand. We believe that the importance of brand recognition is essential for the success of our service offerings because of the level of competition for these services. Customer awareness of our brand, as well as the perceived value of our brand, will depend largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high quality customer experience. To promote our brand, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, expense related to advertising and other marketing efforts. We can provide no assurance that these efforts will be successful. During 2015, we entered into a partnership with Robert Herjavec of the television show Shark Tank, which offers us the opportunity to provide marketing support to the businesses in which he invests. If Mr. Herjavec were to become the subject of adverse news reports or negative publicity, such events could reduce the effectiveness of our partnership, which in turn, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA component of our brand promotion strategy is establishing a relationship of trust with our customers, which we believe can be achieved by providing a high-quality customer experience. We have invested, and will continue to invest, resources in website development, design and technology, and customer service and production operations. Our ability to provide a high-quality customer experience is also dependent on external factors including the reliability and performance of our suppliers, telecommunications providers and third-party carriers. If we are unable to provide a high-quality customer experience for any reason, our reputation may be harmed and our efforts to develop brand loyalty could be adversely impacted. The failure of our brand promotion activities to meet our expectations could adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and maintain customer relationships, adversely harming our business and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware or other cyber attacks involving the confidential information of our customers, employees or business partners, or the perception that e-commerce is not secure, could adversely affect our reputation and business.\nInformation security risks have increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and increased use of the internet, as well as the increased sophistication and activities of hackers, terrorists and activists, some of which may be linked to hostile foreign governments. Our businesses use internet-based channels that collect customers\u2019 account and other sensitive information, and bill customers\u2019 credit card accounts. Within Small Business Services, we provide internet-based marketing services, including web hosting services, which we provide directly to small businesses and through wholesale partners, and in Financial Services, we provide financial institutions a suite of financial technology solutions. We rely on various security procedures and systems to ensure the secure storage and transmission of information, including encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties. Computer networks and the internet are, by nature, vulnerable to\nunauthorized access. An accidental or willful security breach could result in unauthorized access and/or use of customer information, including consumers' nonpublic personal information. Our security measures could be breached by third-party action, computer viruses, accidents, or error or malfeasance by an employee or contractor. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage computer systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect immediately, and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities, fraud, trickery or other means of deceiving employees, contractors and temporary staff. We have encountered threats of this type from time to time, and while to-date, such threats have not materially impacted our business or financial results, we can provide no assurance of a similar result in the future.\nAlthough we continue to invest in a system of information security and controls, a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our or our customers' proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation, all of which could deter clients and consumers from ordering our products and services, and result in the termination of client contracts. Any of these events would adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, if we were to experience an information security breach, we may be required to expend significant amounts to remedy, protect against, or mitigate the effect of the breach, and we may not be able to remedy the situation in a timely manner, or at all. We could also be exposed to time-consuming and expensive litigation, government inquiries and/or enforcement actions. If we are unsuccessful in defending a lawsuit regarding information security breaches, we may be forced to pay damages, penalties and fines, any of which would have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nIn addition, there are federal, state and foreign laws requiring companies to notify individuals of information security breaches involving their personal data, the cost of which could negatively affect our financial results. These mandatory disclosures regarding an information security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity. If we were required to make such a disclosure, it may cause our clients and customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our information security measures. Likewise, general publicity regarding information security breaches at other companies could lead to the perception among the general public that e-commerce is not secure. This could decrease traffic to our websites, negatively affect our financial results and limit future business opportunities.\nWe face uncertainty regarding the success of recent and future acquisitions, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nDuring 2015, we acquired Datamyx LLC, as well as selected assets of Range, Inc., Verify Valid LLC, Tech Assets, Inc., FMC Resource Management Corporation and FISC Solutions. During 2014, we acquired NetClime, Inc. and Wausau Financial Systems, Inc., as well as selected assets of Gift Box Corporation of America, and during 2013, we acquired VerticalResponse, Inc. and substantially all of the assets of Acton Marketing, LLC and Destination Rewards, Inc. We have invested in acquisitions that offer marketing solutions and other services and that extend the range of products and services we offer to financial institutions and small businesses. In addition, during the past three years, we have purchased the operations of several small business distributors with the intention of growing revenue in our Small Business Services distributor channel. The integration of any acquisition involves numerous risks, including, among others:\n\u2022\ndifficulties and/or delays in assimilating operations, products and services, as well as ensuring that a strong system of information security and controls is in place;\n\u2022\nfailure to realize expected synergies and savings;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention from other business concerns and risks of managing an increasingly diverse set of products and services across expanded and new industries;\n\u2022\ndecisions by our customers or the customers of the acquired business to temporarily or permanently seek alternate suppliers;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\npotential exposure to unknown liabilities; and\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees.\nOne or more of these factors could impact our ability to successfully integrate an acquisition and could negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe expect to continue to invest in small to medium-sized acquisitions. The time and expense associated with finding suitable businesses, technologies, or services to acquire can be disruptive to our ongoing business and may divert management\u2019s attention. We cannot predict whether suitable acquisition candidates can be acquired on acceptable terms or whether any acquired products, technologies or businesses will contribute to our revenue or earnings to any material extent. Additionally, significant acquisitions typically result in additional contingent liabilities and/or additional amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets, and thus, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nInterruptions to our website operations or information technology systems could damage our reputation and harm our business.\nThe satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our information technology systems is critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers. We could experience temporary interruptions in our websites, transaction processing systems, network infrastructure, service technologies, printing production facilities or customer service operations for a variety of reasons, including, among others: human error, software errors, security breaches, power loss, telecommunications failures, equipment failures, vandalism, fire, flood, extreme weather, terrorism, and other events beyond our control. In addition, our technology, infrastructure and processes may contain undetected errors or design faults that may cause our websites or operating systems to fail. The failure of our systems could interfere with the delivery of products and services to our customers, impede our customers' ability to do business and result in the loss or corruption of critical data. In addition to the potential loss of customers, we may be required to incur additional development costs and divert technical and other resources, and we may be the subject of negative publicity and/or liability claims, all of which would adversely affect our reputation and operating results.\nThe cost and availability of materials, delivery services and energy could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the cost and availability of paper, plastics, ink, retail packaging supplies, promotional materials, other raw materials, delivery services, and energy. Paper costs represent a significant portion of our materials cost. Paper is a commodity and its price has been subject to significant volatility due to supply and demand in the marketplace, as well as volatility in the raw material and other costs incurred by our paper suppliers. There are also relatively few paper suppliers. As such, when our suppliers increase paper prices, we may not be able to obtain better pricing from alternative suppliers. Historically, we have not been negatively impacted by paper shortages because of our relationships with paper suppliers. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to purchase sufficient quantities of paper if such a shortage were to occur.\nWe depend upon third-party providers for delivery services and for outsourced products and services. Events resulting in the inability of these service providers to perform their obligations, such as work slowdowns or extended labor strikes, could adversely impact our results of operations by requiring us to secure alternate providers at higher costs. Postal rates are dependent on the operating efficiency of the United States Postal Service (USPS) and on legislative mandates imposed upon the USPS. Postal rates have increased in recent years and the USPS has incurred significant financial losses. This may result in changes to the breadth and/or frequency of USPS mail delivery services in the future. In addition, fuel costs have fluctuated over the past several years. Increased fuel costs can increase the costs we incur to deliver products to our customers, as well as the price we pay for outsourced products. Competitive pressures and/or contractual arrangements may inhibit our ability to reflect increased costs in the price of our products.\nIf we do not adapt to changes in technology in a timely and cost-effective manner, our ability to sustain and grow our business could be adversely affected.\nChanges in the nature of technology solutions used by small businesses and their customers may occur rapidly. In addition, the markets for many of the services provided by our Financial Services segment are characterized by constant technological changes. The introduction of competing products and services using new technologies, the evolution of industry standards or the introduction of more attractive products or services could make some or all of our products and services less desirable, or even obsolete. These potential changes are magnified by the continued rapid growth of the internet and the intense competition we face. To be successful, our technology-based products and services must keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards, address the ever-changing and increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers, and achieve market acceptance. We could lose current and potential customers if we are unable to develop products and services that meet these changing demands in a timely manner. Additionally, our operating results could be adversely affected if we are required to incur substantial costs to keep pace with technological advances.\nAsset impairment charges would have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations.\nGoodwill and an indefinite-lived trade name represented 54.0% of our total assets as of December 31, 2015. On at least an annual basis, we assess whether the carrying value of these assets is impaired. This analysis considers factors including, but not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions. For example, if our stock price were to decline for a sustained period, if a downturn in economic conditions were to negatively affect our actual and forecasted operating results, if order volume declines for our Direct Checks segment were to accelerate, or if recent acquisitions were to fail to achieve expected operating results, these situations could indicate a decline in the fair value of one or more of our reporting units. This may require us to record an impairment charge for a portion of goodwill and/or our indefinite-lived trade name. We are also required to assess the carrying value of other long-lived assets, including intangibles and assets held for sale. If we were required to record an asset impairment charge for any reason, our consolidated results of operations would be adversely affected.\nGovernmental regulation could limit or harm our business.\nPortions of our business are subject to regulations implementing the privacy and information security requirements of the federal financial modernization law known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, as well as the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions\nAct, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and other federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the protection of certain consumer information. These laws and regulations require us to develop, implement and maintain policies and procedures to protect the security and confidentiality of consumers' nonpublic personal information. In addition, some of our recently acquired businesses trigger compliance requirements under laws governing remote deposit capture, use of consumer report data, and payment processing. We are also subject to additional requirements in certain of our contracts with financial institution clients and communications service providers, which are often more restrictive than the regulations, as well as confidentiality clauses in certain of our contracts related to small businesses\u2019 customer information. These regulations and agreements limit our ability to use or disclose nonpublic personal information for other than the purposes originally intended, which could limit business opportunities. Proposed data breach regulations may increase the costs of compliance for the protection of nonpublic personal information. The complexity of compliance with regulations, as well as the increased focus on cyber security, may also increase our cost of doing business. It may also affect our financial institution clients, reducing their discretionary spending and thus, possibly reducing the amount they spend on our products and services.\nDue to our increasing use of the internet for sales and marketing, laws specifically governing digital commerce, the internet, mobile applications, behavioral advertising and email marketing may have an impact on our business. Existing and future laws governing issues such as privacy, consumer protection or commercial email may limit our ability to market and provide our products and services. Pending global data protection regulations may increase the costs of compliance in servicing international markets for our wholesale business services channels. Additionally, we could be impacted if laws are enacted related to the liability of online businesses for actions taken by their customers, including fraud, illegal content, spam, phishing, libel, defamation, and other abusive conduct. More restrictive legislation, such as new privacy laws, search engine marketing restrictions, \u201canti-spam\u201d regulations, or email privacy rules, could decrease marketing opportunities, decrease traffic to our websites, and/or increase the cost of obtaining new customers.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Act\") continues to increase the complexity of consumer protection rules for financial institutions and introduces more stringent regulatory capital requirements for financial institutions. It is likely that the Act has and will continue to have a negative impact on the profitability of our financial institution clients as they incur costs to comply with the new regulations. A report published in December 2015 by the United States Government Accountability Office indicated that the Act is negatively affecting the profitability of financial institutions, but its full impact remains uncertain because many of its rules have yet to be implemented and insufficient time has passed to evaluate others. Because of the additional costs, financial institutions may put significant pricing pressure on their suppliers, including their check and service providers. The increase in cost and profit pressure may also lead to further consolidation of financial institutions. Additionally, the Act gave the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) the authority to pursue financial institutions engaged in unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. The CFPB\u2019s rule-making and enforcement power may also extend to financial institutions\u2019 service providers. This has made some financial institutions wary of offering add-on services, such as fraud/identity protection, expedited check delivery or rewards programs, to their customers. It would have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we were unable to market such services to consumers or small businesses through our financial institution clients. Additionally, as our product and service offerings become more technologically focused, and with expanded regulatory expectations for supervision of third-party service providers, additional portions of our business could become subject to direct federal regulation and/or examination. This would increase our cost of doing business and could slow our ability to introduce new products and services and otherwise adapt to a rapidly changing business environment.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission issued final rules mandated by the Act regarding disclosure of the use of tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold, known as conflict minerals, in products manufactured by public companies. These rules require a reasonable country of origin inquiry to determine whether such minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. Accordingly, we implemented a reasonable country of origin inquiry program, which resulted in our disclosures relating to conflict minerals in May 2014 and May 2015. There are costs associated with complying with these rules and the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products could be adversely affected. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict-free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origin of all conflict minerals used in our products.\nEconomic conditions could have an adverse effect on operating results in each of our business segments.\nEconomic conditions have affected, and will continue to affect, our results of operations and financial position. Current and future economic conditions that affect consumer and business spending, including unemployment levels, the availability of credit, and small business confidence, as well as the financial condition and growth prospects of our customers, may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our business relies on small business spending. As such, the level of small business confidence and the rate of small business formations and closures impact our business. In recent years, below average small business optimism, as well as declines in small business formations and increases in small business closures, negatively impacted our results of operations and/or our growth opportunities in Small Business Services. We believe small businesses are more likely to be significantly affected by economic downturns than larger, more established companies. During a sluggish economy, it may be more difficult for small businesses to obtain credit and small businesses may choose to spend their limited funds on items other than our products and services. Within our personal check printing businesses, consumer spending, employment levels, and housing stock and starts impact the number of checks consumers use. Moderate growth in consumer spending and private\nsector employment during 2015 most likely had a neutral impact on our personal check businesses. An increase in housing stock and starts has a positive impact on the number of checks purchased, as new households typically are in need of new checks. According to statistics released by the U.S. Census Bureau in January 2016, housing units completed during 2015 increased 9% as compared to 2014. We cannot predict whether these economic trends will improve, stay the same or worsen in the near future.\nAs a result of global economic conditions in recent years, a number of financial institutions sought additional capital, merged with other financial institutions and, in some cases, failed. This turmoil in the financial services industry affected and may continue to affect our results of operations. The failure of one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or large portions of our customer base, could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to the possibility of losing a significant client, the inability to recover contract acquisition payments made to one or more of our larger financial institution clients, or the inability to collect accounts receivable or contractually required contract termination payments, could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations. There may also be an increase in financial institution mergers and acquisitions during periods of economic uncertainty. Such an increase could adversely affect our operating results. Often the newly combined entity seeks to reduce costs by leveraging economies of scale in purchasing, including its check supply contracts. This results in check providers competing intensely on price in order to retain not only their previous business with one of the financial institutions, but also to gain the business of the other party in the merger/acquisition. Although we devote considerable effort toward the development of a competitively-priced, high-quality suite of products and services for the financial services industry, there can be no assurance that significant financial institution clients will be retained or that the impact of the loss of a significant client can be offset through the addition of new clients or by expanded sales to our remaining clients.\nA deterioration in financial markets and/or in general business conditions in 2016 would negatively affect our operating results.\nIf third-party providers of certain significant information technology needs are unable to provide services, our business could be disrupted and the cost of such services could increase.\nWe have entered into agreements with third-party providers for information technology services, including telecommunications, network server and transaction processing services. In addition, we have agreements with companies to provide services such as on-line payment solutions. A service provider's ability to provide services could be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including unauthorized access, computer viruses, accidental or intentional actions, electrical disruptions, or other conditions. In the event that one or more of our service providers is unable to provide adequate or timely information technology services, our ability to deliver products and services to our customers could be adversely affected. Although we believe we have taken adequate steps to protect our business through contractual arrangements with our service providers, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of disruption in service. Any significant disruption could harm our business, including damage to our brand and loss of customers. Additionally, although we believe that information technology services are available from numerous sources, a failure to perform by one or more of our service providers could cause a disruption in our business while we obtain an alternative source of supply. The use of substitute third-party providers could also result in increased expense.\nThe failure to reduce costs could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nIntense competition, declines in the use of checks and business forms, the commoditization of web services, and sluggish economic conditions compel us to continually improve our operating efficiency in order to maintain or improve profitability. We have significantly reduced costs over the past several years, primarily within sales, marketing, service fulfillment and operational support, as well as our shared services functions, including product fulfillment, information technology, real estate, finance and human resources. We realized net cost reductions of approximately $50 million in 2015, as compared to our 2014 results of operations, and we will continue to explore ways to simplify our business processes and reduce our cost and expense structure. Cost reduction initiatives have required and will continue to require up-front expenditures related to items such as redesigning and streamlining processes, consolidating information technology platforms, standardizing technology applications, further enhancing our strategic supplier sourcing arrangements, improving real estate utilization and funding employee severance benefits. We can provide no assurance that we will achieve future cost reductions or that we will do so without incurring unexpected or greater than anticipated expenditures. Moreover, we may find that we are unable to achieve business simplification and/or cost reduction goals without disrupting our business and, as a result, may choose to delay or forgo certain cost reductions as business conditions require. Failure to continue to improve our operating efficiency could adversely affect our business if we are unable to remain competitive.\nWe may be unable to maintain our licenses to use third-party intellectual property on favorable terms, which would affect our ability to offer licensed products to our customers, and thus, adversely affect our operating results.\nCheck designs licensed from third parties account for a portion of our revenue. These license agreements generally average two to three years in duration. There can be no guarantee that such licenses will be available to us indefinitely or under terms that would allow us to continue to sell the licensed products profitably, which would adversely impact our results of operations.\nThird-party claims could result in costly litigation, and in the event of an unfavorable outcome, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in claims, litigation and other proceedings relating to the conduct of our business, including purported class action litigation. Such legal proceedings may include claims related to our employment practices, claims asserting deceptive business practices or claims alleging violations of consumer protection-oriented laws. In addition, third parties may assert patent and other intellectual property infringement claims against us and/or our clients, which could include aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by non-practicing entities. Any such claims could result in litigation against us and could also result in regulatory proceedings being brought against us by various federal and state agencies that regulate our business. These claims, whether successful or not, could divert management's attention or result in costly and time-consuming litigation. Accruals for identified claims or lawsuits are established based on our best estimates of our probable liability. However, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation. Any unfavorable outcome of a material claim or material litigation could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to customer payment-related risks, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe accept payments for our products and services on our websites by a variety of methods, including credit and debit cards, checks and wire transfers. For debit and credit cards, we pay interchange and other fees that may increase over time. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules and requirements, which have changed over time and could change in the future or be reinterpreted to make it more costly, more difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules and requirements, we may be subject to fines and/or higher transaction fees. Any changes could increase our cost of compliance, which would negatively affect our financial results. We could also lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, which would likely result in the loss of customers and the inability to attract new customers.\nIn addition, we may be liable for fraudulent transactions conducted on our websites, such as the use of stolen credit card numbers. To date, we have not incurred significant losses from payment-related fraud, but we continue to face the risk of losses from this type of fraud.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and other qualified employees, our business could suffer.\nThe success of our business depends on the contributions and abilities of key employees, especially in the areas of sales, marketing, product management, and information technology. If we are unable to retain our existing employees and/or attract qualified personnel, we may not be able to grow and manage our business effectively. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.\nSales and other tax collection requirements could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe currently collect sales, use and similar taxes in jurisdictions where our legal entities have a physical presence, in accordance with existing state and local tax laws. If one or more state or local jurisdictions enacts legislation requiring collection beyond our current practices, the increased cost to our customers may discourage them from purchasing our products and services, which would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if one or more state or local jurisdictions successfully asserts that we should have collected sales or other taxes in the past, but did not, we could incur a substantial liability for uncollected taxes.\nWe may be unable to protect our rights in intellectual property, which could harm our business and ability to compete.\nWe rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secret and patent protection, and confidentiality and license agreements to protect our trademarks, software and other intellectual property. These protective measures afford only limited protection. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or otherwise independently develop substantially equivalent products or services that do not infringe on our intellectual property rights. We may be required to spend significant resources to protect our trade secrets and to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce intellectual property protection could harm our business and ability to compete.\nWe are subject to environmental risks which, if realized, could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nOur printing facilities are subject to many federal, state and local regulations designed to protect the environment, including those related to air emissions, wastewater discharge, waste disposal, and remediation of contaminated sites. We have sold former printing facilities to third parties and, in some instances, have agreed to indemnify the buyer of the facility for certain environmental liabilities. Unforeseen conditions at current or former facilities could result in additional liability and expense beyond our insurance coverage.\nThe effects of human activity on global climate change have attracted considerable public and scientific attention, as well as the attention of the United States government. Regulation or some form of legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas\nemissions is currently being implemented in the United States, as well as globally. Increased government regulation to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change could result in increased compliance costs and other financial obligations, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nA decline in the value of our postretirement medical plan assets and/or a significant increase in the number of participants in our postretirement medical plan could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.\nThe fair value of our postretirement medical plan assets is subject to various risks, including credit, interest and overall market volatility risk. If the equity markets were to experience a significant decline in value, the fair value of our plan assets would decrease. This would affect the funded status of our plan and result in higher postretirement benefit expense in the future. Although our obligation is limited to funding benefits as they become payable, future declines in the fair value of our plan assets could also result in the need to contribute increased amounts of cash to fund benefits payable under the plan.\nThe number of participants in our postretirement medical plan could increase significantly. For the 2016 plan year, 48% of those eligible to participate in our postretirement medical plan have elected not to participate. If a significant portion of those not participating were to opt-in to our plan, our benefit obligation would increase, which would result in increased expense. Although our plan is currently overfunded, a significant increase in plan participants could also require us to contribute increased amounts of cash to fund benefits payable under the plan.", "PERMNO": 61743, "SIC": 2780, "TIC": "DLX"}
