RISK FACTORS\nOur business and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty. The following are factors that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. Additional risks that are currently unknown to us may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that are contained in this Form 10-K or in our other filings or statements may be subject to the risks described below as well as other risks and uncertainties. Please read the cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements in Item 7 below.\nCurrent economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with whom we do business to suffer financial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nEconomic conditions in the South America, the European Union and many other countries and regions in which we do business have experienced various levels of weakness over the last few years, and may remain challenging for the foreseeable future. General business and economic conditions that could affect us include the strength of the economies in which we operate, unemployment, inflation and fluctuations in debt markets. While currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations, there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in the financial markets.\nThere could be a number of other effects from these economic developments on our business, including reduced consumer demand for products; pressure to extend our customers\u2019 payment terms; insolvency of our customers, resulting in increased provisions for credit losses; decreased customer demand, including order delays or cancellations, and counterparty failures negatively impacting our operations.\nIn connection with our defined benefit pension plans, adverse changes in investment returns earned on pension assets and discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities or changes in required pension funding levels may have an unfavorable impact on future pension expense and cash flow.\nIn addition, the volatile worldwide economic conditions and market instability may make it difficult for us, our customers and our suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends, which could cause us to produce excess products that can increase our inventory carrying costs. Alternatively, this forecasting difficulty could cause a shortage of products that could result in an inability to satisfy demand for our products.\nWe operate a multinational business subject to the economic, political and other risks inherent in operating in foreign countries and with foreign currencies.\nWe have operated in foreign countries and with foreign currencies for many years. Our results are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Our operations are subject to political, economic and other risks. There has been and continues to be significant political uncertainty in some countries in which we operate. Economic changes, terrorist activity and political unrest may result in business interruption or decreased demand for our products. Protectionist trade measures and import and export licensing requirements could also adversely affect our results of operations. Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage continued global political and/or economic uncertainty.\nWe primarily sell world commodities. Historically, local prices have adjusted relatively quickly to offset the effect of local currency devaluations, although we cannot guarantee this in the future. Due to pricing controls on many consumer products instituted by the Argentina government, it has taken longer than in the past to achieve pricing improvement in that country. Also, the recent strength in the US dollar may provide some challenges to our sales prices as it could take an extended period of time to fully recapture the impact of foreign currency devaluation.\nWe may hedge transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the currency of the operating unit entering into the underlying transaction. We are subject to the risks normally attendant to such hedging activities.\nRaw material and energy price fluctuations, and supply interruptions and shortages could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur finished products are made primarily from corn. Purchased corn and other raw material costs account for between 40 percent and 65 percent of finished product costs. Some of our products are based upon specific varieties of corn that are produced in significantly less volumes than yellow dent corn. These specialty grains are higher-cost due to their more limited supply and require planning cycles of up to three years in order for us to receive our desired amount of specialty corn. Also, we utilize tapioca in the manufacturing of starch products in Thailand. If our raw materials are not available in sufficient quantities or quality, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nEnergy costs represent approximately 11 percent of our finished product costs. We use energy primarily to create steam in our production process and to dry product. We consume coal, natural gas, electricity, wood and fuel oil to generate energy. In Pakistan, the overall economy has been slowed by severe energy shortages which both negatively impact our ability to produce sweeteners and starches, and also negatively impact the demand from our customers due to their inability to produce their end products because of the shortage of reliable energy.\nThe market prices for our raw materials may vary considerably depending on supply and demand, world economies and other factors. We purchase these commodities based on our anticipated usage and future outlook for these costs. We cannot assure that we will be able to purchase these commodities at prices that we can adequately pass on to customers to sustain or increase profitability.\nIn North America, we sell a large portion of our finished products at firm prices established in supply contracts typically lasting for periods of up to one year. In order to minimize the effect of volatility in the cost of corn related to these firm-priced supply contracts, we enter into corn futures and options contracts, or take other hedging positions in the corn futures market. We are unable to directly hedge price risk related to co-product sales; however, we occasionally enter into hedges of soybean oil (a competing product to our animal feed and corn oil) in order to mitigate the price risk of animal feed and corn oil sales. These derivative contracts typically mature within one year. At expiration, we settle the derivative contracts at a net amount equal to the difference between the then-current price of corn (or soybean oil) and the derivative contract price. These hedging instruments are subject to fluctuations in value; however, changes in the value of the underlying exposures we are hedging generally offset such fluctuations. The fluctuations in the fair value of these hedging instruments may affect our cash flow. We fund any unrealized losses or receive cash for any unrealized gains on futures contracts on a daily basis. While the corn futures contracts or hedging positions are intended to minimize the effect of volatility of corn costs on operating profits, the hedging activity can result in losses, some of which may be material. Outside of North America, sales of finished products under long-term, firm-priced supply contracts are not material. We also use over-the-counter natural gas swaps to hedge portions of our natural gas costs, primarily in our North American operations.\nDue to market volatility, we cannot assure that we can adequately pass potential increases in the cost of corn and other raw materials on to customers through product price increases or purchase quantities of corn and other raw materials at prices sufficient to sustain or increase our profitability.\nOur corn and raw material costs account for 40 percent to 65 percent of our product costs. The price and availability of corn and other raw materials is influenced by economic and industry conditions, including supply and demand factors such as crop disease and severe weather conditions such as drought, floods or frost that are difficult to anticipate and which we cannot control.\nOur profitability may be affected by other factors beyond our control.\nOur operating income and ability to increase profitability depend to a large extent upon our ability to price finished products at a level that will cover manufacturing and raw material costs and provide an acceptable profit margin. Our ability to maintain appropriate price levels is determined by a number of factors largely beyond our control, such as aggregate industry supply and market demand, which may vary from time to time, and the economic conditions of the geographic regions where we conduct our operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment and it may be difficult to preserve operating margins and maintain market share.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. Many of our products compete with virtually identical or similar products manufactured by other companies in the starch and sweetener industry. In the United States, there are competitors, several of which are divisions of larger enterprises that have greater financial resources than we do. Some of these competitors, unlike us, have vertically integrated their corn refining and other operations. Many of our products also compete with products made from raw materials other than corn, including cane and beet sugar. Fluctuation in prices of these competing products may affect prices of, and profits derived from, our products. In addition, government programs supporting sugar prices indirectly impact the price of corn sweeteners, especially HFCS. Competition in markets in which we compete is largely based on price, quality and product availability.\nChanges in consumer preferences and perceptions may lessen the demand for our products, which could reduce our sales and profitability and harm our business.\nFood products are often affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions and demographic trends. For instance, changes in prevailing health or dietary preferences causing consumers to avoid food products containing sweetener products, including HFCS, in favor of foods that are perceived as being more healthy, could reduce our sales and profitability, and such reductions could be material. Increasing concern among consumers, public health professionals and government agencies about the potential health concerns associated with obesity and inactive lifestyles represent a significant challenge to some of our customers, including those engaged in the food and soft drink industries.\nThe uncertainty of acceptance of products developed through biotechnology could affect our profitability.\nThe commercial success of agricultural products developed through biotechnology, including genetically modified corn, depends in part on public acceptance of their development, cultivation, distribution and consumption. Public attitudes can be influenced by claims that genetically modified products are unsafe for consumption or that they pose unknown risks to the environment even if such claims are not based on scientific studies. These public attitudes can influence regulatory and legislative decisions about biotechnology. The sale of the Company\u2019s products which may contain genetically modified corn could be delayed or impaired because of adverse public perception regarding the safety of the Company\u2019s products and the potential effects of these products on animals, human health and the environment.\nOur information technology systems, processes, and sites may suffer interruptions or failures which may affect our ability to conduct our business.\nOur information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, provide critical data connectivity, information and services for internal and external users. These interactions include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting raw materials to finished products, inventory management, shipping products to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, human resources benefits and payroll management, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, and other processes necessary to manage our business. We have put in place security measures to protect ourselves against cyber-based attacks and disaster recovery plans for our critical systems. However, if our information technology systems are breached, damaged, or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, or cyber-based attacks, and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively mitigate on a timely basis, we may encounter disruptions that could interrupt our ability to manage our operations and suffer damage to our reputation, which may adversely impact our revenues, operating results and financial condition.\nOur profitability could be negatively impacted if we fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations.\nApproximately 36 percent of our US and 48 percent of our non-US employees are members of unions. Strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages or slow downs involving our unionized employees could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur reliance on certain industries for a significant portion of our sales could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nApproximately 51 percent of our 2014 sales were made to companies engaged in the food industry and approximately 13 percent were made to companies in both the beverage and animal nutrition markets. Additionally, sales to the paper and corrugating industry and the brewing industry represented approximately 9 percent and 7 percent of our 2014 net sales, respectively. If our food customers, beverage customers, brewing industry customers, paper and corrugating customers or animal feed customers were to substantially decrease their purchases, our business might be materially adversely affected.\nNatural disasters, war, acts and threats of terrorism, pandemic and other significant events could negatively impact our business.\nIf the economies of any countries where we sell or manufacture products are affected by natural disasters; such as earthquakes, floods or severe weather; war, acts of war or terrorism; or the outbreak of a pandemic; it could result in asset write-offs, decreased sales and overall reduced cash flows.\nGovernment policies and regulations in general, and specifically affecting agriculture-related businesses, could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur operating results could be affected by changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, laws and regulations, and other activities of United States and foreign governments, agencies, and similar organizations. These conditions include but are not limited to changes in a country\u2019s or region\u2019s economic or political conditions, trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products, local labor conditions and regulations, reduced protection of intellectual property rights, changes in the regulatory or legal environment, restrictions on currency exchange activities, currency exchange rate fluctuations, burdensome taxes and tariffs, and other trade barriers. International risks and uncertainties, including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism, political hostilities, and war, could limit our ability to transact business in these markets and could adversely affect our revenues and operating results.\nDue to cross-border disputes, our operations could be adversely affected by actions taken by the governments of countries where we conduct business.\nThe recognition of impairment charges on goodwill or long-lived assets could adversely impact our future financial position and results of operations.\nWe perform an annual impairment assessment for goodwill and our indefinite-lived intangible assets, and as necessary, for other long-lived assets. If the results of such assessments were to show that the fair value of these assets were less than the carrying values, we could be required to recognize a charge for impairment of goodwill and/or long-lived assets and the amount of the impairment charge could be material. The results of our impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2014 indicated that the estimated fair value of our Southern Cone of South America reporting unit was less than its carrying amount primarily due to the impacts on its fair value of the elongation of unfavorable financial trends, such as the impact of higher production costs and our inability to increase selling prices to a level sufficient to recover the impacts of inflation and currency devaluation. Also, the political and economic volatility in the region and continued uncertainty in Argentina negatively impacted our earnings forecasts in the near term. Therefore, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 to write-off the remaining balance of goodwill for this reporting unit. Additionally, based on the results of the annual assessment, we concluded that as of October 1, 2014, it was more likely than not that the fair value of all other reporting units was greater than their carrying value (although the $32 million of goodwill at our Brazil reporting unit continues to be closely monitored due to recent trends experienced in this reporting unit, such as continued economic headwinds and heightened competition).\nEven though it was determined that there was no additional long-lived asset impairment as of October 1, 2014, the future occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate that would require a change in our assumptions or strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions, could require us to perform an assessment prior to the next required assessment date of October 1, 2015.\nChanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and in various other foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction, changes in tax laws or tax rates including potential tax reform in the US to broaden the tax base and reduce deductions or credits, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and material adjustments from tax audits.\nThe carrying values of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the US, United Kingdom, Mexico and Korea, are dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in these jurisdictions. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability.\nOperating difficulties at our manufacturing plants could adversely affect our operating results.\nProducing starches and sweeteners through corn refining is a capital intensive industry. We have 36 plants and have preventive maintenance and de-bottlenecking programs designed to maintain and improve grind capacity and facility reliability. If we encounter operating difficulties at a plant for an extended period of time or start-up problems with any capital improvement projects, we may not be able to meet a portion of sales order commitments and could incur significantly higher operating expenses, both of which could adversely affect our operating results. We also use boilers to generate steam required in our manufacturing processes. An event that impaired the operation of a boiler for an extended period of time could have a significant adverse effect on the operations of any plant where such event occurred.\nAlso, we are subject to risks related to such matters as product quality or contamination; compliance with environmental, health and safety regulations; and customer product liability claims. The liabilities that could result from these risks may not always be covered by, or could exceed the limits of our insurance coverage related to product liability and food safety matters. In addition, negative publicity caused by product liability and food safety matters may damage our reputation. The occurrence of any of the matters described above could adversely affect our revenues and operating results.\nWe may not have access to the funds required for future growth and expansion.\nWe may need additional funds to grow and expand our operations. We expect to fund our capital expenditures from operating cash flow to the extent we are able to do so. If our operating cash flow is insufficient to fund our capital expenditures, we may either reduce our capital expenditures or utilize our general credit facilities. For further strategic growth through mergers or acquisitions, we may also seek to generate additional liquidity through the sale of debt or equity securities in private or public markets or through the sale of non-productive assets. We cannot provide any assurance that our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures or that we will be able to obtain additional funds from financial markets or from the sale of assets at terms favorable to us. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or raise sufficient additional funds to cover our capital expenditures or other strategic growth opportunities, we may not be able to achieve our desired operating efficiencies and expansion plans, which may adversely impact our competitiveness and, therefore, our results of operations. Our working capital requirements, including margin requirements on open positions on futures exchanges, are directly affected by the price of corn and other agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly.\nWe may not successfully identify and complete acquisitions or strategic alliances on favorable terms or achieve anticipated synergies relating to any acquisitions or alliances, and such acquisitions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and require significant management resources.\nWe regularly review potential acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, as well as potential strategic alliances. We may be unable to find suitable acquisition candidates or appropriate partners with which to form partnerships or strategic alliances. Even if we identify appropriate acquisition or alliance candidates, we may be unable to complete such acquisitions or alliances on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, the process of integrating an acquired business (such as Penford), technology, service or product into our existing business and operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Integration of an acquired company also may require significant management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our business. Moreover, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or strategic alliance, and such transactions may not generate anticipated financial results. Future acquisitions could also require us to issue equity securities, incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or amortize expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could harm our business.\nAn inability to contain costs could adversely affect our future profitability and growth.\nOur future profitability and growth depends on our ability to contain operating costs and per-unit product costs and to maintain and/or implement effective cost control programs, while at the same time maintaining competitive pricing and superior quality products, customer service and support. Our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure depends on continued containment of manufacturing, delivery and administrative costs, as well as the implementation of cost-effective purchasing programs for raw materials, energy and related manufacturing requirements.\nIf we are unable to contain our operating costs and maintain the productivity and reliability of our production facilities, our profitability and growth could be adversely affected.\nVolatility in the stock market, fluctuations in quarterly operating results and other factors could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price for our common stock may be significantly affected by factors such as our announcement of new products or services or such announcements by our competitors; technological innovation by us, our competitors or other vendors; quarterly variations in our operating results or the operating results of our competitors; general conditions in our or our customers\u2019 markets; and changes in the earnings estimates by analysts or reported results that vary materially from such estimates. In addition, the stock market has experienced significant price fluctuations that have affected the market prices of equity securities of many companies that have been unrelated to the operating performance of any individual company.\nNo assurance can be given that we will continue to pay dividends.\nThe payment of dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be subject to our financial results and the availability of surplus funds to pay dividends.", "PERMNO": 85645, "SIC": 2040, "TIC": "INGR"}
