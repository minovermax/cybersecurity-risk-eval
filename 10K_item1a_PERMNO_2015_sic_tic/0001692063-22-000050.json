RISK FACTORS\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain statements regarding business strategies, market potential, future financial performance, future action, results, and any other statements that do not directly relate to any historical or current fact which are \u201cforward-looking\u201d statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), the Exchange Act, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Where, in any forward-looking statement, an expectation or belief as to future results or events is expressed, such expectation or belief is based on the current plans and expectations of management and expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will be achieved or accomplished. Many factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated include those matters described under the sections entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that we may make or persons acting on our behalf may issue.\nYou should consider each of the following factors, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes, in evaluating our business and our prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. In general, we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other companies such as general economic, industry, and/or market conditions and growth rates; risks and uncertainties associated with or arising out of COVID-19 and possible future pandemics; possible future terrorist threats or armed conflicts and their effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks occur, our business and financial results could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry, and Strategy\nOur operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions.\nOur business and results of operations are sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact customer shipping volumes, industry freight demand, industry truck capacity, inflation, and our operating costs. Regarding our operating costs, inflationary pressures are occurring and are expected to persist in the near-term. We cannot predict future economic conditions, fuel price fluctuations, revenue equipment resale values, or how consumer confidence could be affected by such conditions. Economic conditions that decrease shipping demand, including but not limited to public health crises, outbreaks of infectious diseases, or increases in truck capacity in the North American transportation and logistics industry, can exert downward pressure on rates and equipment utilization. In general, significant decreases in shipping volumes within the industry or increases in available truck capacity result in more aggressive freight pricing as carriers compete for loads and to maintain truck productivity. Likewise, we are also subject to cost increases outside our control that could materially reduce our profitability if we are unable to offset such increases either through rate increases or cost reductions. Such cost increases include, but are not limited to, driver wages, fuel and energy prices, taxes and interest rates, tolls, license and registration fees, insurance premiums, regulations, revenue equipment and related maintenance costs, and healthcare and other employee benefit costs. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any such cost increases could occur. Any such cost increase or event could adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry that is characterized by intense price competition which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\nCompetition for the freight we transport or manage is based primarily on service, efficiency, available capacity, and to some degree, on freight rates alone. In addition, some of our customers have, and others may in the future, use or expand their own private fleets rather than outsourcing loads to us. Our operating segments compete with many other truckload carriers, logistics, brokerage, and transportation service providers of varying sizes, and to a lesser extent, LTL carriers, railroads, and other transportation or logistics companies, some of which have a larger fleet, greater access to equipment, preferential customer contracts, greater capital resources, or other competitive advantages. Our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business, especially when economic conditions are present which negatively impact customer shipping volumes, truck capacities, or operating costs. Moreover, to limit the number of approved carriers to a manageable number, some of our customers select \u201ccore carriers\u201d as approved transportation service providers, and in some instances, we may not be selected. Other of our customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, which also periodically results in the loss of business to competitors. These competitive dynamics could have an adverse effect on the number of shipments we transport and the freight rates we receive, which could limit our growth opportunities and reduce our profitability.\nWell-resourced, non-traditional competitors have entered our industry and markets who appear to be willing to operate at little or no margin in order to gain market share which, individually or collectively, could cause us to lower our pricing and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur industry has experienced market entrance by well-resourced, non-traditional firms or startups who, in some cases, have undercut market prices via digital brokerage platforms to take market share in the fragmented North American transportation and logistics industry.\nOur existing competitors, as well as new market entrants, may also introduce or adopt new brokerage platforms or technologies, which could increase competitive pressures. Although we believe we are well positioned and have adopted technologies, developed strategies, and heavily invested in our own digital service offerings to deter, compete with, or supplant existing competitors and new market entrants, there can be no assurance that our investments, technologies, or strategies will be successful.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from our major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nWe strive to maintain a diverse customer base however, a significant portion of our operating revenues is generated from a number of major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Aside from our dedicated operations, we generally do not have long-term contractual relationships or rate agreements or minimum volume guarantees with our customers. Furthermore, certain of the long-term contracts in our dedicated operations are subject to cancellation. There is no assurance any of our customers, including our dedicated customers, will continue to utilize our services, renew our existing contracts, or continue at the same volume levels. Despite the existence of contractual arrangements, certain of our customers may nonetheless engage in competitive bidding processes that could negatively impact our contractual relationship. In addition, certain of our major customers may increasingly use their own truckload and delivery fleets, which would reduce our freight volumes. A reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers, including our dedicated customers, could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDifficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers could materially, adversely affect our profitability and ability to maintain or grow our fleet.\nLike many truckload carriers, we experience difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified drivers, both new and experienced, including owner-operators, and such shortages have and could continue to require us to significantly increase driver compensation, rely more on higher-cost third-party carriers, idle revenue equipment, or dispose of the equipment altogether, any of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability. Our challenge with attracting and retaining qualified drivers is driven by several factors including intense market competition for a limited pool of qualified drivers, inconsistent driver pay, the preference among drivers to work closer to home and be home most nights, and our highly selective hiring standards.\nOur turnover rate requires us to continually recruit a substantial number of company and owner-operator drivers in order to meet customer demand. Owner-operator availability is generally affected by operating cost increases (which the owner-operator is responsible for) and generally favorable economic conditions, which drive overall increases in customer demand and heightened competition for owner-operators from other carriers. When shortages of owner-operators occur, we may be forced to increase the settlement rates paid to them and increase company driver pay rates to attract and retain a sufficient number of drivers. These increases could negatively affect our results of operations to the extent that we would be unable to obtain corresponding freight rate increases.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our operations, supply chains, and workforce, and we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, volatility in freight volumes and demand for certain of our service offerings.\nThere is continued uncertainty around the duration, breadth, and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Government and public health officials continue to recommend or mandate precautions to mitigate its spread, including prohibitions on unvaccinated individuals congregating in large groups, mask mandates, and vaccination requirements to attend certain events or places of business. The pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused substantial volatility and disruption in global supply chains. Consequently, we and our customers, suppliers, third-party business partners, and contractors may continue to experience business disruptions, including worker absenteeism and resignations, office and factory closures, disruptions to ports, shipping lanes, and other shipping infrastructure, border closures, or other travel or health-related restrictions. Collectively, these disruptions could adversely impact our ability to operate efficiently.\nThe Company is continuing to monitor the progression of the pandemic and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company\u2019s operational and financial performance will depend on many factors outside the Company\u2019s control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory, and duration of the pandemic; potential employee lawsuits alleging that unsafe workplaces have caused employees to contract COVID-19, or otherwise relating to the pandemic; the imposition of protective public safety measures; and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and supply chain, and demand for consumer products. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described throughout the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nThe mandated precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 have had, and may continue to have, an impact on the Company\u2019s freight volumes, affecting our revenues and earnings. Additional future impacts on the Company (some of which have already occurred as described in this risk factor) may include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on demand for the Company\u2019s services, the Company\u2019s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, the Company\u2019s ability to execute its strategic plans, the Company\u2019s ability to hire and retain drivers, and the Company\u2019s profitability and cost structure. While no one can predict with any certainty the scale, length of disruption, or liabilities resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that our results of operations could be negatively affected by the impact of the virus on the Company\u2019s associates, customers, and suppliers or further governmental, regulatory, fiscal, and public health responses. We are unable to predict any future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, and results of operations at this time.\nA subset of our employee population works remotely (prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic) which may exacerbate the cybersecurity risks to our business, including an increased demand for information technology resources, increased risk of phishing, and other cybersecurity attacks.\nWe have, and will continue to have, a portion of our workforce that works from home full-time or under flexible work arrangements, and we have provided associates with expanded remote network access options which enable them to work outside of our corporate infrastructure and, in some cases, use their own personal devices, which exposes the Company to additional cybersecurity risks. The United States Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (\u201cCISA\u201d) has warned that cybercriminals will take advantage of the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic to launch attacks which will further disrupt operations. Specifically, our associates working remotely expose the Company to cybersecurity risks in the following ways: (1) unauthorized access to sensitive information as a result of increased remote access, including associates use of company-owned and personal devices and videoconferencing functions and applications to remotely handle, access, discuss, or transmit confidential financial data, (2) increased exposure to phishing and other scams as cybercriminals use the fear and uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic to further manipulate associates through phishing schemes to, among other things, install malicious software on Company systems and equipment and surrender sensitive information, and (3) violation of international, federal, or state-specific privacy laws. We believe that the increased number of associates working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has incrementally increased our cyber risk profile, but we are unable to predict the extent or impacts of those risks at this time. A significant disruption of our information technology systems, unauthorized access to or loss of confidential information, or legal claims resulting from our violation of privacy laws could each have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe success of our businesses depends on our strong reputation and ability to maintain the Schneider brand value.\nBecause the services that we market and sell under the Schneider brand generate essentially all of the Company\u2019s revenues, the Schneider brand name is our most valuable sales and marketing tool. Press coverage, lawsuits, regulatory investigations, or other adverse publicity that assert some form of wrongdoing or that depict the Company or any of our executives, associates, contractors, or agents in a negative light, regardless of the factual basis of the assertions being made, could tarnish our reputation and result in a loss of brand equity. If we do not maintain and protect our brand image and reputation, demand for our services could wane and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.\nIf fuel prices rise or fall significantly, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur truckload operations are dependent upon diesel fuel, and accordingly, significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to pass increased costs on to customers through rate increases or fuel surcharges or if shippers opt for intermodal rail over trucking their freight. Likewise, if diesel fuel prices decrease significantly, the results of our intermodal operations could be adversely affected as shippers shift intermodal freight to over the road trucking. Prices and availability of petroleum products are subject to political, economic, geographic, weather-related, and market factors that are generally outside our control and each of which may lead to fluctuations in the cost of fuel.\nOur fuel surcharge program does not protect us against the full effect of increases in fuel prices, and the terms of our fuel surcharge agreements vary by customer. In addition, because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices, our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture the increased costs we pay for fuel, especially when prices are rising. There is variability in the compensatory nature of individual customer fuel surcharge programs that can affect inflationary cost recovery of fuel.\nThere is no assurance that such fuel surcharges can be maintained indefinitely or will be sufficiently effective. Our results of operations would be negatively affected to the extent we cannot recover higher fuel costs or fail to improve our fuel price protection through our fuel surcharge program. Increases in fuel prices, or a shortage or rationing of diesel fuel, could also materially and adversely affect our results of operations. As of December 31, 2021, we did not have any derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations.\nWe depend on railroads in the operation of our intermodal business, and therefore, our ability to offer intermodal services could be limited if we experience instability from third parties we use in that business.\nOur Intermodal segment utilizes railroads and some third-party drayage carriers to transport freight for our intermodal customers. The majority of these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads. While we have had agreements with all of the Class I railroads, our primary contracts are currently with the BNSF and CSX Transportation (\u201cCSX\u201d) freight railroads to provide rail-based freight transportation services in support of our intermodal operations. One of our competitors has a preferential contractual arrangement with BNSF, which limits the market share and relative profitability of the services we provide through the BNSF. Beginning in 2023, UP will replace BNSF as our primary rail service provider in the western U.S. The transition to UP and away from BNSF will be complete by January 2023. The transition will require cooperation and coordination by Schneider with both BNSF and UP to be successful and to ensure no interruptions in our intermodal service results. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by any extended interruption of our intermodal service offering due to this transition or UP's ability to manage our rail volumes following the transition.\nIn certain markets and rail corridors, rail service is limited to a few railroads or even a single railroad due to the lack of competition. Our ability to provide intermodal services in certain traffic lanes is likely to be reduced or constricted if any of the Class I railroads were to discontinue service in those lanes or if the overall state of rail service in those lanes were to deteriorate.\nOur contracts with the railroads are subject to periodic renewal, and our intermodal business may be adversely affected by any adverse change in our contract terms with the railroads, our relationships with the railroads, or declines in service and volume levels provided by the railroads.\nIn addition, a portion of the freight we deliver through both our Intermodal and Truckload segments is imported to the U.S. through ports of call where workers are largely unionized, and which recently have been, subject to COVID-induced congestion, backlogs, and unloading delays. The ILWU is a labor union which primarily represents dock workers on the West Coast of the U.S. The ILWU\u2019s current coast wide contract with west coast port owners is scheduled to expire on July 1, 2022. In the previous four contract negotiations between the ILWU and port owners dating back to the late 1990s, negotiations went past the July 1 deadline, and in those contract years, work slowdowns or an employer lockout ensued. Work stoppages, shipping backlogs, port congestion, or other disruptions at any of these ports could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nThe valuation of the Company\u2019s investments in strategic partners and technologies is subject to volatility.\nThe market valuation of our strategic investments, especially as it relates to our investment in TuSimple which is publicly traded, may experience substantial price volatility which, when accounted for under GAAP, could have a material adverse affect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Refer to Note 5, Investments, to our consolidated financial statements for information on our strategic investments. Those investments can be negatively affected by market and economic factors including liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, interest rate fluctuations, or other factors. As a result, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are making strategic investments in new offerings and technologies and expect to continue to make such investments in the future. These ventures are inherently risky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe engage in strategic transactions and make strategic investments including investments in autonomous vehicle technology, cloud-based transportation management system software platforms, telematics, and mobile software applications which are focused on establishing a competitive advantage in the transportation and logistics services offered by the Company or exploiting new market opportunities. Refer to Note 5, Investments, to our consolidated financial statements for information on our strategic investments. Such strategic investments naturally entail risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. For example, we may not be able to derive value from strategic investments or we may incur higher than expected costs in realizing a return on such investments or overestimate the benefits that we receive or realize from such investments. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that any of our strategic investments will generate anticipated financial returns. If our strategic investments fail to meet our expectations, our business and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nWe depend on third-party capacity providers, and issues of performance, availability, or pricing with these transportation providers could increase our operating costs, reduce our ability to offer intermodal and brokerage services, and limit growth in our brokerage and logistics operations, which could adversely affect our revenue, results of operations, and customer relationships.\nOur Logistics segment is highly dependent on the services of third-party capacity providers, such as other truckload carriers, LTL carriers, railroads, ocean carriers, and airlines. Many of those providers face the same economic challenges as we do and, therefore, are actively and competitively soliciting business. These economic conditions may have an adverse effect on the performance, availability, and cost of third-party capacity. If we are unable to secure the services of these third-party capacity providers at reasonable rates, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSevere weather and similar events could harm our results of operations or make our results more volatile.\nFrom time to time, we may suffer impacts from severe weather and similar events, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, and explosions, which may become more severe in the future as a result of climate change. These events may disrupt freight shipments or routes, affect regional economies, destroy our assets, disrupt fuel supplies, increase fuel costs, cause lost revenue and productivity, increase our maintenance costs, or adversely affect the business or financial condition of our customers, any of which could harm our results of operations or make our results of operations more volatile.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Condition, Taxation, and Capital Requirements\nOur goodwill or long-lived assets may become impaired, which could result in a significant charge to earnings.\nWe hold significant amounts of goodwill and long-lived assets, and the balances of these assets could increase in the future if we acquire other businesses. At December 31, 2021, the balance of our goodwill, internal use software, and long-lived assets was $2.4 billion, and the total market value of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares was $4.8 billion. Under GAAP, our goodwill and long-lived assets are subject to an impairment analysis when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such goodwill or long-lived assets may not be recoverable. In addition, we test goodwill for impairment annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or long-lived assets may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, a sustained decline in stock price and market capitalization, significant negative variances between actual and expected financial results, reduced future cash flow estimates, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations or legal proceedings, failure to realize anticipated synergies from acquisitions, and slower growth rates in our industry. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or long-lived assets is determined to exist, negatively impacting our results of operations. If our market capitalization was to fall below the book value of our total stockholders\u2019 equity for a sustained period, we may conclude that the fair value of certain of our long-lived assets is materially impaired. In this case, we would be required under GAAP to record a noncash charge to our earnings which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe have significant ongoing capital requirements that could affect our profitability if our capital investments do not match customer demand for invested resources, or we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations.\nOur operations are capital-intensive, and our strategic decision to invest in newer equipment requires us to expend significant amounts in capital expenditures annually. The amount and timing of such capital expenditures depend on various factors, including anticipated freight demand, and the price and availability of new or used tractors. Recently, the amount and timing of capital expenditures also has been affected by delayed truck deliveries by original equipment manufacturers due to semiconductor and other component shortages. If anticipated demand differs materially from actual usage, our capital-intensive truckload operations may have too many or too few assets. Moreover, resource requirements vary based on customer demand, which may be subject to seasonal or general economic conditions. During periods of decreased customer demand, our asset\nutilization may suffer, and we may be forced to sell equipment on the open market in order to rightsize our fleet. This could cause us to incur losses on such sales, particularly during times of a softer used equipment market, either of which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability.\nShould demand for freight shipments weaken or our margins suffer due to increased competition or general economic conditions, we may have to limit our fleet size or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods, either of which could have a materially adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate which would impact our future financial results.\nOur effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by, among other things, changes in the regulations relating to capital expenditure deductions, or changes in tax laws where we operate, including the uncertainty of future tax rates. We cannot give any assurance as to the stability or predictability of our effective tax rate in the future because of, among other things, uncertainty regarding the tax laws and policies of the countries where we operate.\nAlthough we do not expect current U.S. federal income tax proposals (including, for example, those included in President Biden\u2019s Build Back Better Act released at the end of October 2021) to have a material impact on our effective tax rate or tax payments, we cannot predict what changes to U.S. federal income tax law may be proposed in the future or whether they are likely to be passed. In addition, while our review of the corporate tax proposals introduced in the draft legislation did not indicate that any such proposals would have an impact on Schneider\u2019s effective tax rate or tax payments, we cannot predict what legislation may be proposed in the future or its likelihood of passing. Our estimates of the impact of any proposed legislation may not reflect the actual impact of such legislation once it is implemented and enforced by governmental authorities.\nFurther, our tax returns are subject to periodic reviews or audits by domestic and international authorities, and these audits may result in adjustments to our provision for taxes or allocations of income or deductions that result in tax assessments different from amounts that we have estimated. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these audits to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these audits or that our tax provisions will not change materially or be adequate to satisfy any associated tax liability. If our effective tax rates were to increase or if our tax liabilities exceed our estimates and provisions for such taxes, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nInsurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings.\nWe self-insure, or insure through our wholly-owned captive insurance company, a significant portion of our claims exposure resulting from auto liability, general liability, cargo, and property damage claims, as well as workers\u2019 compensation. In addition to insuring portions of our risk, our captive insurance company provides insurance coverage to our owner-operator drivers. We are also responsible for our legal expenses relating to such claims which can be significant both on an aggregate and individual claim basis. Although we reserve for anticipated losses and expenses and periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect our experience, estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related costs to settle or resolve them, is inherently difficult, and such costs could exceed our estimates. Accordingly, our actual losses associated with insured claims may differ materially from our estimates and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in material amounts.\nAs a supplement to our self-insurance program, we maintain insurance with excess insurance carriers for potential losses which exceed the amounts we self-insure. Although we believe our aggregate insurance limits should be sufficient to cover our historic claims amounts, the commercial trucking industry has experienced a wave of blockbuster or so-called \u201cnuclear\u201d verdicts, where juries have awarded tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars to accident victims and their families. Given this recent trend, it is possible that one or more claims could exceed our aggregate coverage limits. If any claim were to exceed our aggregate insurance coverage, we would bear the excess, in addition to our other self-insured amounts.\nGiven the current claims settlement environment, the amount of coverage available from excess insurance carriers is decreasing, and the premiums for this excess coverage are increasing significantly. For the foregoing reasons, our insurance and claims expenses may increase, or we could increase our self-insured retention as policies are renewed or replaced. In addition, we may assume additional risk within our captive insurance company that we may or may not reinsure. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if (1) our costs or losses significantly exceed our aggregate coverage limits, (2) we are unable to obtain insurance coverage in amounts we deem sufficient, (3) our insurance carriers fail to pay on our insurance claims, or (4) we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided.\nRisks Relating to Our Governance Structure\nVoting control of the Company is concentrated with a Voting Trust that was established for certain members of the Schneider family which limits the ability of our other shareholders to influence major corporate transactions.\nWe currently have a dual class common stock structure consisting of (1) Class A common stock, entitled to ten votes per share and (2) Class B common stock, entitled to one vote per share. The Schneider family, including trusts established for the benefit of certain members of the Schneider family, collectively beneficially own 100% of our outstanding Class A common stock and approximately 42% of our outstanding Class B common stock, representing approximately 94% of the total voting power of all of our outstanding common stock and approximately 69% of our total outstanding common stock.\nA Voting Trust holds the shares of Class A common stock that are beneficially owned by the Schneider family. The independent directors who are members of our Corporate Governance Committee serve as trustees of the Voting Trust, and, in general, those directors have full power and discretion to vote the Class A shares included in the Voting Trust with two exceptions. First, in the case of any Major Transaction (as defined under our Amended and Restated Bylaws, including, most notably, a transaction resulting in more than 40% of the voting power of our common stock being held outside of the Schneider family), the independent directors of our Corporate Governance Committee must vote the shares of common Class A stock held in the Voting Trust as directed by the trustees of certain trusts which have been established for the benefit of certain Schneider family members. As a result, the outcome of the vote on any Major Transaction is not within the discretion of the Voting Trustees. Second, the independent directors of our Corporate Governance Committee must vote the shares of common Class A stock held in the Voting Trust in accordance with a nomination process agreement pursuant to which two specified Schneider family members will be nominated to serve on our Board on an annual, rotating basis.\nAs a result of these arrangements, the Voting Trust controls the outcome of major corporate transactions that require or may be accomplished by shareholder approval, and our Class B shareholders would be unable to affect the outcome of such transactions should any be proposed.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE and, as a result, qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements relating to our Corporate Governance Committee. Our shareholders will not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of other companies that are subject to such requirements.\nThe Voting Trust has more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors. As a result, we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the corporate governance rules for NYSE-listed companies. As a controlled company, certain exemptions under the NYSE listing standards exempt us from the obligation to comply with certain NYSE corporate governance requirements, including the requirement that we have a Corporate Governance Committee that is composed entirely of independent directors.\nWe have elected to take advantage of this \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption, and therefore the holders of our Class B common stock may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for NYSE-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could therefore make our Class B common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise depress our stock price.\nThe price of our Class B common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and may fluctuate significantly which may adversely impact investor confidence and increase the likelihood of securities class action litigation.\nOur Class B common stock price has experienced volatility in the past and may remain volatile in the future. Volatility in our stock price can be driven by many factors including divergence between our actual or anticipated financial results and published expectations of analysts or the expectations of the market, the gain or loss of customers, announcements that we, our competitors, our customers, or our vendors or other key partners may make regarding their operating results and other factors which are beyond our control such as market conditions in our industry, new market entrants, technological innovations, and economic and political conditions or events. These and other factors may cause the market price and demand for our Class B common stock to fluctuate substantially. During 2021, the closing stock price of our Class B common stock ranged from a low of $20.46 per share to a high of $27.10 per share. Our Class B common stock is also included in certain market indices, and any change in the composition of these indices to exclude our company may adversely affect our stock price. Increased volatility in the financial markets and/or overall economic conditions may reduce the amounts that we realize in the future on our cash equivalents and/or marketable securities and may reduce our earnings as a result of any impairment charges that we record to reduce recorded values of marketable securities to their fair values.\nFurther, securities class action litigation is often brought against a public company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. Due to changes in our stock price, we may be the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial uninsured costs and divert management\u2019s attention and our resources.\nCertain provisions in our certificate of incorporation, by-laws, and Wisconsin law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the Company, which could decrease the trading price of our Class B common stock.\nEach of our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws, and Wisconsin law, as currently in effect, contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to a bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:\n\u2022a dual class common stock structure, which provides the Schneider National, Inc. Voting Trust the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring shareholder approval, even if the Schneider National, Inc. Voting Trust beneficially owns significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;\n\u2022a requirement that certain transactions be conditioned upon approval by 60% of the voting power of our capital stock, including any transaction which results in the Schneider family holding less than 40% of the voting power of our capital stock, a sale of substantially all of our assets, and a dissolution;\n\u2022no provision for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of stock to elect some directors;\n\u2022the inability of shareholders to call a special meeting except when the holders of at least ten percent of all votes entitled to be cast on the proposed issue submit a written demand;\n\u2022advance notice procedures for the nomination of candidates for election as directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at shareholder meetings;\n\u2022the ability of our directors, without a stockholder vote, to fill vacancies on our Board (including those resulting from an enlargement of the Board);\n\u2022the requirement that both 75% of the directors constituting the full Board and stockholders holding at least 80% of our voting stock are required to amend certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our by-laws; and\n\u2022the right of our Board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nOur status as a Wisconsin corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the WBCL may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control even if a change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with any person that is the beneficial owner of at least 10% of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock (an \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d) for a period of three years after such person becomes an interested shareholder, unless our Board has approved, before the date on which the shareholder acquired the shares, that a business combination or the purchase of stock made by such interested stockholder on such stock acquisition date. In addition, we may engage in a business combination with an interested shareholder after the expiration of the three-year period with respect to that shareholder only if one or more of the following conditions is satisfied: (1) our Board approved the acquisition of the stock before the date on which the shareholder acquired the shares, (2) the business combination is approved by a majority of our outstanding voting stock not beneficially owned by the interested shareholder, or (3) the consideration to be received by shareholders meets certain fair price requirements of the WBCL with respect to form and amount.\nThese provisions could have the effect of discouraging, delaying, or preventing a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also have the effect of discouraging proxy contests and making it more difficult for our non-controlling shareholders to elect directors of their choosing, causing us to take other corporate actions.\nIn light of present circumstances, we believe these provisions taken as a whole protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board and by providing our Board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers or prevent the removal of incumbent directors. However, these provisions could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board determines is not in the best interests of the Company and all of our stockholders.\nWe may change our dividend policy at any time.\nThe declaration and amount of any future dividends, including the payment of special dividends, is dependent on multiple factors including our financial performance and capital needs and is subject to the discretion of our Board. The Board may, in its discretion, determine to cut, cancel, or eliminate our dividend and, therefore, the declaration of any dividend, at any frequency, as it is not assured. Each quarter, the Board considers whether the declaration of a dividend is in the best interest of our shareholders and in compliance with applicable laws and agreements. Although we expect to continue to pay dividends to holders of our Class A and Class B common stock, we have no obligation to do so, and our dividend policy may change at any time without notice. Future dividends may also be affected by factors that our Board deems relevant, including our potential future capital requirements for investments, legal risks, changes in federal and state income tax laws, or corporate laws and contractual restrictions such as financial or operating covenants in our debt arrangements. As a result, we may not pay dividends at any rate or at all.\nRisks Related to Legal Compliance\nIf the independent contractors with whom we engage under our alternative owner-operator business model are deemed by law to be employees, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nLike many of our competitors, in certain of our service offerings we offer an alternative owner-operator business model, which provides opportunities for small business owners and private entrepreneurs who own tractors to selectively contract with us as independent contractors to transport freight, which they choose, at contracted rates. Were such independent contractors subsequently determined to be our employees, we would be liable under various federal and state laws for a variety of taxes, wages, and other compensation and benefits, including for prior periods, which were not timely paid or remitted. In the U.S., the regulatory and statutory landscape relating to the classification status of independent contractors (or workers) who work in temporary or flexible jobs and who are paid by the task or project is evolving. Some state governments and federal and state regulatory authorities, as well as independent contractors themselves, have asserted that independent contractor drivers in the trucking industry, such as those operating under our owner-operator model, are employees rather than independent contractors for a variety of purposes, including income tax withholding, workers\u2019 compensation, wage and hour compensation, unemployment, and other issues. Some states have enacted, or are considering, new laws to make it harder to classify worker as independent contractors and easier for tax and other authorities to reclassify independent contractors as employees.\nAdditionally, federal legislators, among other things, have sought to abolish a safe harbor which allows taxpayers meeting certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a long-standing, recognized practice and extend the FLSA which establishes minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, and other employment standards affecting employees in the private sector and in federal, state, and local governments, to independent contractors. Additionally, courts in certain jurisdictions have recently issued decisions that could result in a greater likelihood that independent contractors will be judicially classified as employees. As a result, we are, from time to time, party to administrative proceedings and litigation, including class actions, alleging violations of the FLSA and other state and federal laws which seek retroactive reclassification of certain current and former independent contractors as employees. An adverse decision in such legal proceedings in an amount that materially exceeds our reserves or, federal or state legislation in this area which render the owner-operator model either impractical or extinct thereby curtailing our revenue opportunities, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability.\nWe operate in a regulated industry, and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn the U.S., the DOT, FMCSA, and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business, generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service, equipment operation, safety, financial reporting, and leasing arrangements with independent contractors. We are audited periodically by the DOT to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety, HOS, and other rules and regulations. If we were found to be out of compliance, the DOT could restrict or otherwise impact our operations. We also operate in various Canadian provinces (as granted by the Ministries of Transportation and Communication in such provinces) and contract with third-party carriers to transport freight into Mexico. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws, rules, or regulations to which we are subject, whether actual or alleged, could expose us to fines, penalties, or potential litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements, and judgments. Further, these agencies or governments could institute new laws, rules or regulations, or issue interpretation changes to existing regulations at any time. The short and long-term impacts of changes in legislation or regulations are difficult to predict and could materially and adversely affect our earnings and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials, underground fuel storage tanks, and discharge and retention of storm water. We operate in industrial areas, where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. Certain of our facilities have waste oil or fuel storage tanks and fueling islands. If a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances occurs, if there are releases of hazardous substances we transport, if soil or groundwater contamination is found at our facilities or results from our operations, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be liable for cleanup costs or other damages or fines or penalties, any of which could be in material amounts or have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe rely significantly on our information technology systems, a disruption, failure, or security breach of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on information technology throughout all areas of our business and operations to receive, track, accept, and complete customer orders; process financial and non-financial data; compile results of operations for internal and external reporting; and achieve operating efficiencies and growth. Such data and information remain vulnerable to cyber-attacks, cybersecurity breaches, ransomware attacks, hackers, theft, or other unauthorized disclosure which, if successful, could result in the disclosure of confidential customer or commercial data, loss of valuable intellectual property, or system disruptions and subject us to civil liability and fines or penalties, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business, any of which could be material. In addition, delayed sales, lower margins, or lost customers resulting from security breaches or network disruptions could materially reduce our revenues, materially increase our expenses, damage our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nOur information technology systems may also be susceptible to interruptions or failures for a variety of reasons including software or hardware failure, user error, power outages, natural disasters, computer viruses, or other types of interruptions. For example, in February 2022 we experienced a firmware defect (which was not related to a cyber event and did not involve a breach of data) relating to a third-party vendor\u2019s equipment that interrupted the functioning of our computer systems and disrupted our operations. As a result of this incident, we were required to rely on manual operations to book freight, execute loads and pay carriers for two business days and otherwise execute our business continuity plans. While this disruption resulted in lost revenue and operating profit, it is not expected to have a material impact on our annual results of operations. However, a significant disruption or failure in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, including operational disruptions, loss of confidential information, external reporting delays or errors, legal claims, or damage to our business reputation.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees, and if we are unable to attract and retain such qualified employees, our business and our ability to execute our business strategies may be materially impaired.\nOur future success depends largely on the continued service and efforts of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to identify, attract, retain, and motivate them. Although we believe we have an experienced and highly qualified management team, the loss of the services of these key personnel could have a significant adverse impact on us and our future profitability. Additionally, we must continue to recruit, develop, and retain skilled and experienced operations, technology, and sales managers if we are to realize our goal of expanding our operations and continuing our growth. Failure to recruit, develop, and retain a core group of service center managers could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to various claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business which could adversely affect us.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including those related to accidents involving our trucks, cargo claims, commercial disputes, property damage, and environmental liability, which may not be covered by our insurance. Such proceedings include claims by current or former employees or third parties, and certain proceedings have been certified or purport to be class actions. In appropriate cases, we have taken and will seek subrogation from third parties who are responsible for losses or damages that we may become legally obligated to pay to claimants. The costs of defending or maintaining such legal proceedings, particularly class-action litigation, may be substantial and, in any period, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 16648, "SIC": 4210, "TIC": "SNDR"}
