{"cik": "716643", "company": "REGIS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-08-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn inability to continue to execute on our strategy and build on foundational initiatives we've implemented could adversely impact our same-store sales and operating results.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to improve sales, as well as both cost of service and product and operating margins. Same-store sales are affected by average ticket and same-store guest visits. A variety of factors affect same-store guest visits, including the guest experience, staffing and retention of stylists and salon leaders, fashion trends, competition, current economic conditions, product assortment, marketing programs and weather conditions. These factors may cause our same-store sales to differ materially from prior periods and from our expectations.\nSince fiscal year 2013, we have gone through significant change as we executed upon a number of foundational initiatives to support and focus on our business strategies to return the Company to sustainable long-term growth and profitability.\nThese foundational changes were disruptive to our business. In fiscal 2014, same-store sales declined 4.8% compared to the prior year. While fiscal 2015 same-store sales declines of 0.3% represent improved trends, there can be no assurance we will be able to successfully execute on our business strategy in fiscal 2016 and beyond to achieve long-term growth, profitability and a broader scale turn. Such impairment charges could be material to our consolidated balance sheet and results\nof operations. If negative same-store sales continue and we are unable to offset the impact with operational savings, our results of operations will be negatively impacted affected and we may be required to take impairment charges.\nIn addition, the unexpected loss of any of our executive leadership team members could adversely affect the momentum we have achieved in executing on our business strategies and could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is based on the success of our stylists. It is important for us to attract, train and retain talented stylists and salon leaders.\nGuest loyalty is highly dependent upon the stylists who serve our guests. In order to profitably grow our business, it is important for us to attract, train and retain talented stylists and salon leaders and to adequately staff our salons. Because the salon industry is highly-fragmented and comprised of many independent operators, the market for stylists is highly competitive. Offering competitive wages, benefits, education and training programs are important elements to attracting and retaining great stylists. If we are not successful in attracting, training and retaining stylists or in staffing our salons, our same-store sales could continue to decline and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nChanges in regulatory and statutory laws, such as increases in the minimum wage and changes that make collective bargaining easier, proposed changes to overtime requirements, and the costs of compliance and non-compliance with such laws, may result in increased costs to our business.\nWith 9,556 locations and approximately 47,000 employees worldwide, our financial results can be adversely impacted by regulatory or statutory changes in laws. Due to the number of people we employ, laws that increase minimum wage rates, employment taxes, overtime requirements or costs to provide employee benefits may result in additional costs to our Company.\nA number of states and cities in which we do business have recently increased or are considering increasing the minimum wage, with increases generally phased over several years depending upon the size of the employer. The Department of Labor is also proposing changes to the technical requirements for classification of employees deemed to be exempt from the overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act that could increase the number of employees eligible to receive overtime pay. Increases in minimum wages and overtime pay could significantly increase our costs, and our ability to offset these increases through price increases is limited. In addition, changes in labor laws could increase the likelihood of some or all of our employees being subjected to greater organized labor influence. If a significant portion of our employees were to become unionized, it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIncreases in minimum wages, overtime requirements and unionization could also have an adverse effect on the performance of our franchisees, especially if our franchisees are treated as a \"joint employer\" with us by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) or as a large employer under minimum wage statutes because of their affiliation with us. With respect to the NLRB, it is anticipated that its current standard for joint employer relationships may become more lenient and, as such, we may face an increased risk of being alleged to be a joint employer with our franchisees. In addition, we must comply with state employment laws, including the California Labor Code, which has stringent requirements and penalties for non-compliance.\nIn addition to employment laws, we are also subject to a wide range of federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, including those affecting public companies, product manufacture and sale, and governing the franchisor-franchisee relationship, in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Compliance with new, complex and changing laws may cause our expenses to increase. In addition, any non-compliance with laws or regulations could result in penalties, fines, product recalls and enforcement actions or otherwise restrict our ability to market certain products or attract or retain employees, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to the examination of our income tax returns, payroll taxes and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes and payroll tax accruals. There can be no assurances as to the outcome of these examinations. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and payroll accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nOur effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits, and any repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes.\nChanges to healthcare laws in the U.S. may increase the number of employees who participate in our healthcare plans, which may significantly increase our healthcare costs and negatively impact our operating results.\nWe offer comprehensive healthcare coverage to eligible employees in the United States. Historically, a majority of our eligible employees do not participate in our healthcare plans. Due to recent changes to healthcare laws in the United States pursuant to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), it is possible that enrollment in the Company\u2019s healthcare plans may increase as employees continue to assess their healthcare alternatives and if provisions regarding automatic enrollment of new eligible employees become effective in the future. Furthermore, potential fees and or penalties may be assessed as a result of individuals either not being offered healthcare coverage within a limited timeframe or if coverage offered does not meet minimum care and affordability standards. An increase in the number of employees who elect to participate in our healthcare plans, new ACA requirements or if the Company fails to comply with one or more provisions of ACA may significantly increase our healthcare-related costs and negatively impact our operating results.\nIf we fail to manage cyber threats and protect the security of sensitive information about our guests, employees, vendors or company, we could be subject to business disruption, negative publicity, costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and our reputation could suffer.\nThe nature of our business involves processing, transmission and storage of personal information about our guests as well as employees, vendors and our Company. Cyber-attacks designed to gain access to sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving, and high profile electronic security breaches leading to unauthorized release of sensitive guest information have occurred recently at a number of large U.S. companies. Our efforts to protect sensitive guest and employee information may not be successful in preventing a breach in our systems, or detecting and responding to a breach on a timely basis. As a result of a security incident or breach in our systems, our systems could be interrupted or damaged, or sensitive information could be accessed by third parties. If that happened, our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information, which could cause them to stop visiting our salons altogether. Such events could lead to lost future sales and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, as the regulatory environment relating to retailers and other companies' obligations to protect sensitive data becomes stricter, a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to fines or other regulatory sanctions and potentially to lawsuits. These laws are changing rapidly and vary among jurisdictions. Furthermore, while our franchisees are independently responsible for data security at franchised locations, a breach of guest or vendor data at a franchised location could also negatively affect public perception of our brands. More broadly, our incident response preparedness and disaster recovery planning efforts may be inadequate or ill-suited for a security incident and we could suffer disruption of operations or adverse effects to our operating results.\nWe rely heavily on our management information systems. If our systems fail to perform adequately or if we experience an interruption in their operation, our results of operations may be affected.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems. We rely heavily on our management information systems to collect daily sales information and guest demographics, generate payroll information, monitor salon performance, manage salon staffing and payroll costs, inventory control and other functions. Certain of our management information systems are developed and maintained by external vendors, including our POS system. In addition, certain of our systems are outdated or of limited functionality. The failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate, or to meet the continuously evolving needs of our business, could disrupt our business and may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe rely on external vendors for products and services critical to our operations.\nOur dependence on vendors exposes us to operational, reputational, financial, and compliance risk. Our vendors are also responsible for the security of certain Company data. In the event that one of our key vendors becomes unable to continue to provide products and services, or their systems fail, are compromised or the quality of their systems deteriorate, we may suffer operational difficulties and financial loss.\nChanges in manufacturers' choice of distribution channels may negatively affect our revenues.\nThe retail products we sell are licensed to be carried exclusively by professional salons. The products we purchase for sale in our salons are purchased pursuant to purchase orders, as opposed to long-term contracts and generally can be terminated by the producer without much advance notice. Should our product manufacturers decide to utilize other distribution channels, such as large discount retailers, or to utilize such distribution channels to a larger extent than they have in the past, it could negatively impact product sales revenue. In addition as e-commerce evolves and expands, our product sales could negatively be impacted if we are unable to sell retail products in a similar fashion.\nOur continued success depends in part on the success of our franchisees, who operate independently.\nAs of June 30, 2015, approximately 24% of our salons are franchised locations. We derive revenues associated with our franchised locations from royalties, service fees and product sales to franchised locations. Our financial results are therefore dependent in part upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees. As we increase our focus on our franchise business, our dependence on our franchisees grows.\nWe have limited control over how our franchisees\u2019 businesses are run. Though we have established operational standards and guidelines, they own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their salon locations. If franchisees do not successfully operate their salons in compliance with our standards, our brand reputation and image could be harmed and our financial results could be affected.\nIn addition, our franchisees are subject to the same general economic risks as our Company, and their results are influenced by competition, market trends, and disruptions in their markets due to severe weather and other external events. They may also be limited in their ability to open new locations by an inability to secure adequate financing, especially since many of them are small businesses with much more limited access to financing than our Company, or by the limited supply of favorable real estate for new salon locations. A deterioration in the financial results of our franchisees, or a failure of our franchisees to renew their franchise agreements, could adversely affect our operating results through decreased royalty payments, fees and product revenues.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over the accounting for leases which could reduce investor confidence and adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nIn fiscal year 2015, we identified a material weakness in our internal controls related to our accounting for leases. We are in the process of remediating this weakness, which will require us to devote financial and management resources. While we believe we will remediate this weakness over time, no assurances can be made that our remediation will be effective, and our remedial controls may need to operate for a period of time before we can conclude that they are effective. Until the material weakness is fully remediated, the Company could have material misstatements to the non-cash deferred rent account, and related accounts and disclosures.\nIf we are not able to successfully compete in our business markets, our financial results may be affected.\nCompetition on a market by market basis remains challenging as many smaller chain competitors are franchise systems with local operating strength in certain markets and the hair salon industry as a whole is fragmented and highly competitive for customers, stylists and prime locations. Therefore, our ability to attract guests, raise prices and secure suitable locations in certain markets can be adversely impacted by this competition. If we are not able to successfully compete, our ability to grow same-store sales and increase our revenue and earnings may be impaired.\nChanges to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates may impact our results from operations.\nChanges in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates will have an impact on our expected results from operations. Historically, we have managed the risk related to fluctuations in these rates through the use of fixed rate debt instruments and other financial instruments.\nFailure to simplify and standardize our operating processes across our brands could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nStandardization of operating processes across our brands, marketing and products will enable us to simplify our operating model and decrease our costs. Failure to do so could adversely impact our ability to grow revenue and realize further efficiencies within our results of operations.\nChanges in our key relationships may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe maintain key relationships with certain companies, including Walmart. In particular, we have 2,766 SmartStyle/Cost Cutters salons within Walmart locations, including 69 salons opened during fiscal year 2015. The continued operation and growth of this business is dependent on our relationship with Walmart. In addition, our company-owned locations are concentrated with leases with certain major regional and national landlords. Termination, modification or mismanagement, of any of these relationships could significantly reduce our revenues and have a material and adverse impact on our business, our operating results and our ability to grow.\nFailure to control costs may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe must continue to control our expense structure. Failure to manage our cost of product, labor and benefit rates, advertising and marketing expenses, operating lease costs, other store expenses or indirect spending could delay or prevent us from achieving increased profitability or otherwise adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we fail to comply with any of the covenants in our financing arrangements, we may not be able to access our existing revolving credit facility, and we may face an accelerated obligation to repay our indebtedness.\nWe have several financing arrangements that contain financial and other covenants. If we fail to comply with any of the covenants, it may cause a default under one or more of our financing arrangements, which could limit our ability to obtain additional financing under our existing credit facility, require us to pay higher levels of interest or accelerate our obligations to repay our indebtedness.\nChanges in the general economic environment may impact our business and results of operations.\nChanges to the U.S., Canadian and United Kingdom economies have an impact on our business. General economic factors that are beyond our control, such as interest rates, exchange rates, recession, inflation, deflation, tax rates and policy, energy costs, unemployment trends, extreme weather patterns, other casualty events and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending, may impact our business. In particular, visitation patterns to our salons can be adversely impacted by increases in unemployment rates and decreases in discretionary income levels.\nIf our investment with Empire Education Group is unsuccessful, our financial results may be affected.\nWe have a joint venture arrangement with Empire Education Group (EEG), an operator of accredited cosmetology schools. If EEG is unwilling or unable to devote their financial resources or marketing and operational capabilities to our joint venture, or if our joint venture is terminated, we may not be able to realize anticipated profits and our business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, regulatory changes in the for-profit secondary educational market have had negative business impacts including declines in enrollment, revenues and profitability. If our joint venture arrangement with EEG is not successful, we may have a limited ability to terminate or modify this arrangement. If our joint venture with EEG is terminated, there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract new joint venture partners to continue the activities or to operate that business independently.\nDuring fiscal years 2015 and 2013, we recorded non-cash impairments of $4.7 million and $17.9 million, respectively, related to our investment in EEG. Due to economic, regulatory and other factors, including declines in enrollment, revenue and profitability in the for-profit secondary educational market, we may be required to take additional non-cash impairment charges related to our investments and such non-cash impairments could be material to our consolidated balance sheet and results of operations. During fiscal year 2015, we recorded our share of a non-cash deferred tax asset valuation allowance recorded by EEG of $6.9 million. During fiscal years 2014 and 2013, we recorded our share of pre-tax non-cash impairment charges recorded by EEG for goodwill and fixed and intangible assets of $21.2 and $2.1 million, respectively. EEG may be required to take additional non-cash impairment charges related to long-lived assets and our share of such non-cash impairment charges could be material to our consolidated balance sheet and results of operations. The exposure to loss related to our involvement with EEG is the $14.8 million carrying value of the investment at June 30, 2015.\nChanges in fashion trends may impact our revenue.\nChanges in consumer tastes, hair product innovation, and fashion trends can have an impact on our financial performance.", "PERMNO": 76711, "SIC": 7200, "TIC": "RGS"}
