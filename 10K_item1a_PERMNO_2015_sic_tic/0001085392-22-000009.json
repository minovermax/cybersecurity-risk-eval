{"cik": "1085392", "company": "PUGET ENERGY INC /WA", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors, in addition to other factors and matters discussed elsewhere in this report, should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that Puget Energy and PSE may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial also may impair PSE\u2019s business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, Puget Energy\u2019s and PSE\u2019s business, results of operations and financial conditions would suffer.\nRISKS RELATING TO PSE\u2019s REGULATORY AND RATE-MAKING PROCEDURES\nPSE's regulated utility business is subject to various federal and state regulations. PSE's regulatory risks include, but are not limited to, the items discussed below.\nThe actions of regulators can significantly affect PSE\u2019s earnings, liquidity and business activities. The rates that PSE is allowed to charge for its services are the single most important item influencing its financial position, results of operations and liquidity. PSE is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its wholesale and retail customers are determined by both the Washington Commission and the FERC.\nPSE is also subject to the regulatory authority of the Washington Commission with respect to accounting, operations, the issuance of securities and certain other matters, and the regulatory authority of the FERC with respect to the transmission of electric energy, the sale of electric energy at the wholesale level, accounting and certain other matters. In addition, proceedings with the Washington Commission typically involve multiple stakeholder parties, including consumer advocacy groups and various consumers of energy, who have differing concerns but who have the common objective of limiting rate increases or decreasing rates. Policies and regulatory actions by these regulators could have a material impact on PSE\u2019s financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nPSE\u2019s recovery of costs is subject to regulatory review and its operating income may be adversely affected if its costs are disallowed. The Washington Commission determines the rates PSE may charge to its electric retail customers based, in part, on historic costs during a particular test year, adjusted for certain normalizing adjustments. Power costs on the other hand, are normalized for market, weather and hydrological conditions projected to occur during the applicable rate year, the ensuing twelve-month period after rates become effective. The Washington Commission determines the rates PSE may charge to its natural gas customers based on historic costs during a particular test year. Natural gas costs are adjusted through the PGA mechanism, as discussed previously. If in a specific year PSE\u2019s costs are higher than the amounts used by the Washington Commission to determine the rates, revenue may not be sufficient to permit PSE to earn its allowed return or to cover its costs. In addition, the Washington Commission has the authority to determine what level of expense and investment is reasonable and prudent in providing electric and natural gas service. If the Washington Commission decides that part of PSE\u2019s costs do not meet the standard, those costs may be disallowed partially or entirely and not recovered in rates. For the aforementioned reasons, the rates authorized by the Washington Commission may not be sufficient to earn the allowed return or recover the costs incurred by PSE in a given period.\nPSE is currently subject to a Washington Commission order that requires PSE to share its excess earnings above the authorized rate of return with customers. The Washington Commission previously approved an electric and natural gas decoupling mechanism for the recovery of its delivery-system and fixed production costs, along with a rate plan and earnings sharing mechanism that requires PSE and its customers to share in any earnings in excess of the authorized rate of return of 7.39%. The earnings test is done for each service (electric/natural gas) separately, so PSE would be obligated to share the earnings for one service exceeding the authorized rate of return, even if the other service did not exceed the authorized rate of return.\nThe PCA mechanism, by which variations in PSE\u2019s power costs are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to a graduated scale, could result in significant increases in PSE\u2019s expenses if power costs are significantly higher than the baseline rate. PSE has a PCA mechanism that provides for recovery of power costs from customers or refunding of power cost savings to customers, as those costs vary from the \u201cpower cost baseline\u201d level of power costs which are set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydrological conditions. Excess power costs or power cost savings will be apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism and will trigger a surcharge or refund when the cumulative deferral trigger is reached. As a result, if power costs are significantly higher than the baseline rate, PSE\u2019s expenses could significantly increase.\nRISKS RELATING TO PSE\u2019s OPERATION\nPSE\u2019s cash flow and earnings could be adversely affected by potential high prices and volatile markets for purchased power, recurrence of low availability of hydroelectric resources, outages of its generating facilities or a failure to deliver on the part of its suppliers. The utility business involves many operating risks. If PSE\u2019s operating expenses, including the cost of purchased power and natural gas, significantly exceed the levels recovered from retail customers, its cash flow and earnings would be negatively affected. Factors which could cause PSE's purchased power and natural gas costs to be higher than anticipated include, but are not limited to, high prices in western wholesale markets during periods when PSE has insufficient energy resources to meet its energy supply needs and/or purchases in wholesale markets of high volumes of energy at prices above the amount recovered in retail rates due to:\n\u2022Below normal levels of generation by PSE-owned hydroelectric resources due to low streamflow conditions or precipitation;\n\u2022Extended outages of any of PSE-owned generating facilities or the transmission lines that deliver energy to load centers, or the effects of large-scale natural disasters on a substantial portion of distribution infrastructure; and\n\u2022Failure of a counterparty to deliver capacity or energy purchased by PSE.\nPSE\u2019s electric generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs. PSE owns and operates coal, natural gas-fired, hydroelectric, and wind-powered generating facilities. Operation of electric generating facilities involves risks that can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels or increase expenditures, including:\n\u2022Facility shutdowns due to a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes;\n\u2022Volatility in prices for fuel and fuel transportation;\n\u2022Disruptions in the delivery of fuel and lack of adequate inventories;\n\u2022Regulatory compliance obligations and related costs, including any required environmental remediation, and any new laws and regulations that necessitate significant investments in our generating facilities;\n\u2022Labor disputes;\n\u2022Operator error or safety related stoppages;\n\u2022Terrorist or other attacks (both cyber-based and/or asset-based); and\n\u2022Catastrophic events such as fires, explosions or acts of nature.\nCyber-attacks, including cyber-terrorism, foreign-state support cyber threats or other information technology security breaches, or information technology failures may disrupt business operations, increase costs, lead to the disclosure of confidential information and damage PSE's reputation. Security breaches of PSE's information technology infrastructure, including cyber-attacks and cyber-terrorism, or other failures of PSE's information technology infrastructure could lead to disruptions of PSE's production and distribution operations, and otherwise adversely impact PSE's ability to safely and effectively operate electric and natural gas systems and serve customers. In addition, an attack on or failure of information technology systems could result in the unauthorized release of customer, employee or Company data that is crucial to PSE's operational security or could adversely affect PSE's ability to deliver and collect on customer bills. Such security breaches of PSE's information technology infrastructure could adversely affect our operations and business reputation, diminish customer confidence, subject PSE to financial liability or increased regulation, expose PSE to fines or material legal claims and liability and adversely affect our financial results. PSE has implemented preventive, detective and remediation measures to manage these risks, and maintains cyber risk insurance to mitigate the effects of these events. Nevertheless, these may not effectively protect all of PSE's systems all of the time. To the extent that the occurrence of any of these cyber-events is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect PSE\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nNatural disasters like wildfires and catastrophic events, including terrorist acts, may adversely affect PSE's business. Events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, extreme weather events, terrorist acts, and other similar occurrences, could damage PSE's operational assets, including utility facilities, information technology infrastructure, distributed generation assets and pipeline assets. Such events could likewise damage the operational assets of PSE's suppliers or customers. These events could disrupt PSE's ability to meet customer requirements, significantly increase PSE's response costs, and significantly decrease PSE's revenues. Unanticipated events or a combination of events, failure in resources needed to respond to events, or a slow or inadequate response to events may have an adverse impact on PSE's operations, financial condition, and results of operations. The availability of insurance covering catastrophic events like wildfires, sabotage and terrorism may be limited or may result in higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more restrictive policy terms.\nPSE is subject to the commodity price, delivery and credit risks associated with the energy markets. In connection with matching PSE's energy needs and available resources, PSE engages in wholesale sales and purchases of electric capacity and energy and, accordingly, is subject to commodity price risk, delivery risk, credit risk and other risks associated with these activities. Credit risk includes the risk that counterparties owing PSE money or energy will breach their obligations for delivery of energy supply or contractually required payments related to PSE's energy supply portfolio. Should the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, PSE may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements. In that event, PSE\u2019s financial results could be adversely affected. Although PSE takes into account the expected probability of default by counterparties, the actual exposure to a default by a particular counterparty could be greater than predicted.\nCosts of compliance with environmental, climate change and endangered species laws are significant and the costs or reduced revenue related to compliance with new and emerging laws and regulations and the occurrence of associated liabilities could adversely affect PSE\u2019s results of operations. PSE\u2019s operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental issues, including air emissions and climate change, endangered species protection, remediation of contamination, avian protection, waste handling and disposal, decommissioning, water protection and siting new facilities. In addition, recent laws proposed or passed by the State of Washington and various municipalities in PSE's service territory, including Seattle, seek to reduce or eliminate the use of natural gas in various contexts, such as for space and water heating in new commercial and multifamily buildings. As a result of these legal requirements, PSE must spend significant sums of money to comply with these measures including resource planning, remediation, monitoring, analysis, adoption of mitigation measures, use of pollution control equipment, and emissions-related abatement and fees. New environmental laws and regulations affecting PSE\u2019s operations or restricting the use of products sold by PSE may be adopted, and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to PSE or its facilities. Compliance with these or other future regulations could require significant expenditures by PSE or reduce revenue and thus adversely affect PSE financially. In addition, PSE may not be able to recover all of its costs for such expenditures through electric and natural gas rates in a timely manner.\nUnder current law, PSE is also generally responsible for any on-site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of the facilities that it currently owns or operates or has previously owned or operated. The occurrence of a material environmental liability or new regulations governing such liability could result in substantial future costs and have a material adverse effect on PSE\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. Specific to climate change, Washington State has adopted both renewable portfolio standards and GHG legislation, including CETA, and PSE anticipates full compliance with these requirements.\nPSE's inability to adequately develop or acquire the necessary infrastructure to comply with new and emerging laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Potential changes in regulatory standards, impacts of new and existing laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations and those seeking to combat climate change, and the need to obtain various regulatory approvals create uncertainty surrounding our energy resource portfolio. The current abundance of low, stably priced natural gas, together with environmental, regulatory, and other concerns surrounding coal-fired generation resources, fossil fuel infrastructure bans, and energy resource portfolio requirements, including those related to renewables development and energy efficiency measures, create strategic challenges as to the appropriate generation portfolio and fuel diversification mix.\nIn expressing concerns about the environmental and climate-related impacts from continued extraction, transportation, delivery and combustion of fossil fuels including natural gas, environmental advocacy groups and other third parties have in recent years undertaken greater efforts to oppose the permitting and construction of natural gas infrastructure projects. These efforts may increase in scope and frequency depending on a number of variables, including the future course of local, state and federal environmental regulation and the increasing financial resources devoted to these opposition activities. PSE cannot predict the effect that any such opposition may have on our ability to develop and construct natural gas infrastructure projects in the future.\nPSE's operating results fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be impacted by various impacts of climate change. PSE's business is seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on its revenue, expenses and operating results. Demand for electricity is greater in the winter months associated with heating. Accordingly, PSE's operations have historically generated less revenue and income when weather conditions are milder in winter. In the event that the Company experiences unusually mild winters, its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. PSE's hydroelectric resources are also dependent on snow conditions in the Pacific Northwest.\nPSE may be adversely affected by extreme events in which PSE is not able to promptly respond, repair and restart the electric and natural gas infrastructure system. PSE must maintain an emergency planning and training program to allow PSE to quickly respond to extreme events. Without emergency planning, PSE is subject to availability of outside contractors during an extreme event which may impact the quality of service provided to PSE\u2019s customers and also require significant expenditures by PSE. In addition, a slow or ineffective response to extreme events may have an adverse effect on earnings as customers may be without electricity and natural gas for an extended period of time.\nPSE depends on its work force and third party vendors to perform certain important services and may be negatively affected by its inability to attract and retain professional and technical employees or the unavailability of vendors. PSE is subject to workforce factors, including but not limited to loss or retirement of key personnel and availability of qualified personnel. PSE\u2019s ability to implement a workforce succession plan is dependent upon PSE\u2019s ability to employ and retain\nskilled professional and technical workers. Without a skilled workforce, PSE\u2019s ability to provide quality service to PSE\u2019s customers and to meet regulatory requirements could affect PSE\u2019s earnings. Also, the costs associated with attracting and retaining qualified employees could reduce earnings and cash flows.\nPSE continues to be concerned about the availability of skilled workers for special complex utility functions. PSE also hires third party vendors to perform a variety of normal business functions, such as power plant maintenance, data warehousing and management, electric transmission, electric and natural gas distribution construction and maintenance, certain billing and metering processes, call center overflow and credit and collections. The unavailability of skilled workers or unavailability of such vendors could adversely affect the quality and cost of PSE\u2019s natural gas and electric service and accordingly PSE\u2019s results of operations.\nPotential municipalization may adversely affect PSE's financial condition. PSE may be adversely affected if we experience a loss in the number of our customers due to municipalization or other related government action. When a town, city, county, or portion of a county in PSE's service territory establishes its own municipal-owned utility or public utility district, it acquires PSE's assets and takes over the delivery of energy services that PSE provides. Although PSE is compensated in connection with the government entity's acquisition of its assets, any such loss of customers and related revenue could negatively affect PSE's future financial condition.\nTechnological developments may have an adverse impact on PSE's financial condition. Advances in power generation, energy efficiency and other alternative energy technologies, such as solar generation, could lead to more wide-spread use of these technologies, thereby reducing customer demand for the energy supplied by PSE which could negatively impact PSE's revenue and financial condition.\nPSE faces risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and other outbreaks that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Business disruptions arising from stay at home mandates due to the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely affected economic activity within Washington State and the United States of America. We cannot predict the degree that the continued spread of COVID-19 and efforts to contain the virus (including, but not limited to, voluntary and mandatory quarantines, vaccination requirements, restrictions on travel, limiting gatherings of people, and reduced operations and extended closures of many businesses and institutions) could materially impact our results of operations, financial condition and ongoing operations. The impacts include but are not limited to:\n\u2022impacting customer demand for electricity and natural gas by our customers, particularly from commercial and industrial customers;\n\u2022reducing the availability and productivity of our employees;\n\u2022reducing the availability and productivity of key contractors and vendors;\n\u2022causing us to experience an increase in costs as a result of our emergency measures, delayed payments from our customers and uncollectible accounts;\n\u2022causing delays and disruptions in the availability of and timely delivery of materials and components used in our operations;\n\u2022causing a deterioration in our financial metrics or the business environment that impacts our credit ratings;\n\u2022causing significant disruption in the financial markets which could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future and cost of capital;\n\u2022resulting in our inability to meet the requirements of the covenants in our existing credit facilities, including covenants regarding the ratio of total debt to total capitalization; and\n\u2022disrupting our ability to meet customer requirements and potentially significantly increase response costs.\nRISKS RELATING TO PUGET ENERGY'S AND PSE'S FINANCING\nThe Company's business is dependent on its ability to successfully access capital. The Company relies on access to internally generated funds, bank borrowings through multi-year committed credit facilities and short-term money markets as sources of liquidity and longer-term debt markets to fund PSE's utility construction program and other capital expenditure requirements of PSE. If Puget Energy or PSE are unable to access capital on reasonable terms, their ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions, including generating capacity, which may be necessary for future growth, could be adversely affected. Capital and credit market disruptions, a downgrade of Puget Energy's or PSE's credit rating or the unavailability of or the imposition of restrictions on borrowings under their credit facilities in the event of a deterioration of financial condition of Puget Energy or PSE may increase Puget Energy's and PSE\u2019s cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial markets.\nThe amount of the Company's debt could adversely affect its liquidity and results of operations. Puget Energy and PSE have short-term and long-term debt, and may incur additional debt (including secured debt) in the future. Puget Energy has access to a multi-year $800.0 million revolving credit facility, secured by substantially all of its assets, which has a maturity date of October 25, 2023. There was $33.3 million outstanding under the facility as of December 31, 2021. Puget Energy's credit facility includes an expansion feature that could, subject to the commitment of one or more lenders, increase the size of the facility to $1.3 billion. PSE also has a separate credit facility, which provides PSE with access to a multi-year $800.0 million revolving credit facility, and includes an expansion feature that could, subject to the commitment of one or more lenders, increase the size of the facility to $1.4 billion. The PSE credit facility matures on October 25, 2023. As of December 31, 2021, no amounts were drawn and outstanding under the PSE credit facility. In addition, Puget Energy has issued $2.0 billion in senior secured notes, whereas PSE, as of December 31, 2021, had approximately $4.8 billion outstanding under first mortgage bonds, pollution control bonds and senior notes. The Company's debt level could have important effects on the business, including but not limited to:\n\u2022Making it difficult to satisfy obligations under the debt agreements and increasing the risk of default on the debt obligations;\n\u2022Making it difficult to fund non-debt service related operations of the business; and\n\u2022Limiting the Company's financial flexibility, including its ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms or at all.\nA downgrade in Puget Energy\u2019s or PSE\u2019s credit rating could negatively affect the ability to access capital, the ability to hedge in wholesale markets and the ability to pay dividends. Although neither Puget Energy nor PSE has any rating downgrade provisions in its credit facilities that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt, a downgrade in the Companies\u2019 credit ratings could adversely affect the ability to renew existing or obtain access to new credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities. For example, under Puget Energy\u2019s and PSE\u2019s facilities, the borrowing spreads over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) (or other applicable index) and commitment fees increase if their respective corporate credit ratings decline. A downgrade in commercial paper ratings could increase the cost of commercial paper and limit or preclude PSE\u2019s ability to issue commercial paper under its current programs.\nAny downgrade below investment grade of PSE\u2019s corporate credit rating could cause counterparties in the wholesale electric, wholesale natural gas and financial derivative markets to request PSE to post a letter of credit or other collateral, make cash prepayments, obtain a guarantee agreement or provide other mutually agreeable security, all of which would expose PSE to additional costs.\nPSE may not declare or make any dividend distribution unless on the date of distribution PSE\u2019s corporate credit/issuer rating is investment grade, or if its credit ratings are below investment grade, PSE\u2019s ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to interest expense for the most recently ended four fiscal quarter periods prior to such date is equal to or greater than 3.0 to 1.0.\nChanges in the method for determining LIBOR and the potential replacement of LIBOR may affect our credit facilities and the interest rates on such borrowings. LIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. Puget Energy and PSE\u2019s credit facilities allow Puget Energy or PSE, respectively to borrow at the bank's prime rate or to make floating rate advances at LIBOR plus a spread that is based upon Puget Energy\u2019s or PSE's credit rating, respectively.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. In November 2020, LIBOR\u2019s administrator indicated that US dollar LIBOR will likely\ncontinue to be published until June 30, 2023, which would allow time for certain legacy contracts to mature before US dollar LIBOR is no longer available.\nIf the method for calculation of LIBOR changes, if LIBOR is no longer available or if lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, Puget Energy or PSE may suffer from potential increases in interest rates on any borrowings. Further, in the event Puget Energy or PSE extends or enters into any substantial amendments to its credit facility, it is possible that the lenders under such credit facility will require that an alternative index to LIBOR be incorporated into such credit facility.\nPoor performance of pension and postretirement benefit plan investments and other factors impacting plan costs could unfavorably impact PSE\u2019s cash flow and liquidity. PSE provides a defined benefit pension plan and postretirement benefits to certain PSE employees and former employees. Costs of providing these benefits are based, in part, on the value of the plan\u2019s assets and the current interest rate environment and therefore, adverse market performance or low interest rates could result in lower rates of return for the investments that fund PSE\u2019s pension and postretirement benefits plans and could increase PSE\u2019s funding requirements related to the pension plans. Changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase PSE's funding requirements related to the pension plans. Any contributions to PSE\u2019s plans in 2022 and beyond as well as the timing of the recovery of such contributions in GRCs could impact PSE\u2019s cash flow and liquidity.\nRISKS RELATING TO PUGET ENERGY'S CORPORATE STRUCTURE\nPuget Energy's ability to pay dividends may be limited. As a holding company with no significant operations of its own, the primary source of funds for the repayment of debt and other expenses, as well as payment of dividends to its shareholder, is cash dividends PSE pays to Puget Energy. PSE is a separate and distinct legal entity and has no obligation to pay any amounts to Puget Energy, whether by dividends, loans or other payments. The ability of PSE to pay dividends or make distributions to Puget Energy, and accordingly, Puget Energy\u2019s ability to pay dividends or repay debt or other expenses, will depend on PSE\u2019s earnings, capital requirements and general financial condition. If Puget Energy does not receive adequate distributions from PSE, it may not be able to meet its obligations or pay dividends.\nThe payment of dividends by PSE to Puget Energy is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to long-term debt contained in PSE\u2019s electric and natural gas mortgage indentures. In addition, beginning February 2009, pursuant to the terms of the Washington Commission merger order, PSE may not declare or pay dividends if PSE\u2019s common equity ratio calculated on a regulatory basis is 44.0% or below, except to the extent a lower equity ratio is ordered by the Washington Commission. Also, pursuant to the merger order, PSE's ability to declare or make any distribution is limited by its' corporate credit/issuer rating and EBITDA to interest ratio, as previously discussed above. The common equity ratio, calculated on a regulatory basis, was 47.5% at December 31, 2021, and the EBITDA to interest expense was 5.5 to 1.0 for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2021.\nPSE\u2019s ability to pay dividends is also limited by the terms of its credit facilities, pursuant to which PSE is not permitted to pay dividends during any Event of Default (as defined in the facilities), or if the payment of dividends would result in an Event of Default, such as failure to comply with certain financial covenants.\nChallenges relating to the operation of the Tacoma LNG facility could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations. The Tacoma LNG facility at the Port of Tacoma, a facility jointly owned by PSE and Puget Energy\u2019s subsidiary, Puget LNG, is intended to provide peak-shaving services to PSE\u2019s natural gas customers, and to provide LNG as fuel primarily to the maritime market. Puget LNG has entered into one fuel supply agreement with a maritime customer, and is marketing the facility\u2019s expected output to other potential customers. Delays in the facility\u2019s operation or in its ability to timely deliver fuel to customers could expose Puget LNG to damages under one or more fuel supply contracts, which could unfavorably impact Puget Energy\u2019s return on investment.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nThe Company may be negatively affected by unfavorable changes in the tax laws or their interpretation. The Company\u2019s tax obligations include income, real estate, public utility, municipal, sales and use, business and occupation and employment-related taxes and ongoing audits related to these taxes. Changes in tax law, related regulations or differing interpretation or enforcement of applicable law by the IRS or other taxing jurisdiction could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements. The tax law, related regulations and case law are inherently complex. The Company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of the law when determining the provision for taxes. These judgments may include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities. Disputes over interpretations of tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority in examination, upon appeal or through litigation.\nPotential legal proceedings and claims could increase the Company\u2019s costs, reduce the Company\u2019s revenue and cash flow, or otherwise alter the way the Company conducts business. The Company is, from time to time, subject to various legal proceedings and claims. Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources. While management believes the Company has reasonable and prudent insurance coverage and accrues loss contingencies for all known matters that are probable and can be reasonably estimated, the Company cannot assure that the outcome of all current or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the Company and/or its results of operations.", "PERMNO": 25443, "SIC": 4931, "TIC": "5495B"}
