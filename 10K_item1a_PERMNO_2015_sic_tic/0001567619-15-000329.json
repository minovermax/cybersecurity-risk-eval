{"cik": "1162315", "company": "AMBASSADORS GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and the other information contained in this Form 10-K as these are important factors, among others, that could materially and adversely affect our future operating results and share price, and could cause actual results to differ materially from expected or historical results. There may be additional risks that we consider not to be material, or which are not known, and any of these risks could have effects similar to those set forth below. See Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a cautionary discussion regarding forward-looking statements. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information set forth in this Annual Report, including Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, including the related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe travel industry and specifically the educational segment within the travel industry are highly competitive. If we are unable to compete effectively in these markets, our financial condition and results of operations could be affected.\nThe travel industry in general and the educational segment of the travel industry in particular are highly competitive and have relatively low barriers to entry. We compete with other companies that provide similar educational travel programs, professional travel and adult continuing education programs, activity camps and summer camps, as well as independent programs organized and sponsored by local teachers with the assistance of local travel agents.\nPeople to People International, under the terms of its agreement with us, reserves the right to offer programs to college students for studies abroad and to grant to other individuals or entities the right to use the People to People International name in connection with professional education and sports programs. In the event companies with similar operations to us are granted the right to use the People to People International name, our operations and competitive position in the industry could be significantly and adversely impacted.\nCertain organizations engaged in the travel business may have substantially greater brand-name recognition and financial, marketing and sales resources than we do, and may offer an educational travel experience at a lower price. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our present or future competitors. If we are unable to compete successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur financial results may suffer if we cannot successfully implement our restructuring plans and or cost cutting objectives aimed at right-sizing our operations to match revenue streams.\nWe have described elsewhere in this report our ongoing plan to terminate or realign certain operations and to take other cost cutting measures that are intended to strengthen our business by right-sizing our operations to match\nrevenue streams. We also described various impairment and restructuring charges related to this plan. If we fail to complete our restructuring plans timely and successfully, or if we fail to achieve the intended cost structure, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be further impacted. This plan also may have an adverse impact upon the morale or motivation of our employees and may result in further distractions to our management. Cost cutting initiatives may also reduce selling and marketing or other operating capabilities reducing our ability to respond to market demand.\nOur business may decline if we cannot successfully update our marketing strategy in light of changes in customer behavior.\nOur traditional marketing model depended on direct mail, which has been declining in effectiveness, and as a result our marketing strategy has struggled as our target customers have shifted away from responding to direct mail and in-person informational meetings. As a part of our restructuring initiatives, we are adopting a new customer acquisition model in an effort to deliver sustainable profits. Our marketing strategy may fail to reach the intended market and may not be successful in generating travelers. This could result in a continued or accelerated reduction in travelers. Any such outcome, alone or in combination with other events or circumstances, may adversely affect our operating results.\nA decline or disruption in the travel industry could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur performance depends upon factors affecting the travel industry in general. Our earnings are especially sensitive to events that affect domestic and international air travel and availability and cost of lodging and transportation. A number of such factors could negatively affect our business including:\n\u2022 Air fare increases resulting from a rise in fuel prices or a reduction of airline capacity;\n\u2022 Increases in the price of lodging;\n\u2022 Travel-related strikes or labor unrest;\n\u2022 Bankruptcies or liquidations by airlines or other travel industry companies; and\n\u2022 Travel-related accidents or the grounding of aircraft due to safety concerns.\nSuch concerns could reduce the demand for our travel program offerings. Any such decrease in demand, depending on its scope and duration, together with any future issues affecting travel safety, could result in a temporary or longer-term decline in demand and adversely affect our results.\nDeterioration of and volatility in general economic conditions could result in reduced consumer spending and a decline in the number of people willing to purchase our premium travel products.\nDemand for our products and services may be significantly affected by the general level of economic activity, level of discretionary spending and employment levels in the United States and key international markets. Therefore, global economic downturns or a recession could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows and our results of operations. Our business could also be adversely impacted by other global economic conditions including excessive inflation, currency fluctuations within the global market, the strength of the U.S. dollar, and foreign taxation changes.\nFor example, economic conditions deteriorated rapidly in the United States and many other countries in 2008 resulting in a reduction in household budgets for potential travelers. These conditions slowed spending on travel and on the services we provide.\nWhile there have been positive indications that the economies of the United States and other world markets have improved over the last few years, future economic weakness and uncertainty may result in significantly decreased spending on our services, which may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance. We may continue to face economic conditions which could further impact demand for premium travel products in the industry and the markets in which we operate.\nNatural disasters, international political or terrorist threats and activities, and other world events or incidents affecting the health, safety, security, program interest and/or program satisfaction of actual and potential program participants could have an adverse effect on our results.\nMost of our travel programs are conducted outside of the United States. Demand for our travel programs may be adversely affected by natural occurrences such as hurricanes, tsunamis, earthquakes, extreme flooding, and epidemics\nor other disease outbreaks such as influenza in geographic regions in which we conduct travel programs. In addition, other international incidents such as war, U.S. military deployments, international and domestic terrorism, civil disturbances, and political instability may occur. These natural occurrences and other events may impact our customers\u2019 willingness to travel to these destinations or our ability to deliver planned programs.\nThe consequences of these types of events are unpredictable and the occurrence of any of the events described above, or other unforeseen developments in one or more of the regions in which we travel, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to acquire, and/or retain travel enrollments, which would substantially impact cash flows, and results of operations. Historically, we have experienced increased cancellations for our travel programs during such times and if these business interruptions occur during the peak travel season, the impact to our financial results could be magnified.\nIf we are unable to use our established brands such as the \u201cPeople to People\u201d name, or if the value of our name, image or brand diminishes, our ability in attracting future travelers could be significantly impacted and our business would be harmed.\nOur brand names and trademarks are integral to our marketing efforts. Our agreements with People to People International, currently scheduled to expire in 2020, give us the exclusive right to develop and conduct programs for grade school through high school students using the People to People International name, and the non-exclusive right to develop and conduct programs for professionals, college students and athletes using the People to People International name. If our agreement with People to People International were terminated or if we were unable to use the branded name to market our programs or destinations, this could have a material adverse effect on our ability to acquire participants for our programs and consequently affect our results of operations.\nWe invest considerable resources in maintaining these brands and trademarks to retain and expand our client base. We have registered a variety of service and trademarks including, but not limited to, the names \u201cPeople to People Ambassador Programs,\u201d \u201cPeople to People Student Ambassador Programs,\u201d \u201cCitizen Ambassador Programs,\u201d and \u201cPeople to People Leadership Ambassador Programs.\u201d In addition, we have the right, subject to certain exceptions, to use the \u201cPeople to People\u201d service, trademarks and logos in our marketing.\nIn addition, our ability to attract and enroll new delegates to travel with us depends on the value of the brands we associate with and our reputation with potential customers. If negative news coverage or other negative public relation matters occur in the student travel industry or specifically related to us, our business could experience adverse effects impacting our volume and profitability.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain effective key personnel with industry specific knowledge, our ability to market and conduct our travel programs would be diminished.\nOur performance is dependent on the continued services and performance of senior management and certain other key personnel with specialized knowledge of our industry. The loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key employees could have an adverse effect on our business operations, along with the ability to grow our business, generate innovative ideas, remain strategic, and recruit and maintain highly functional teams. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policies. Our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly skilled managerial, sales, marketing and customer service personnel. Our inability to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to develop and maintain relationships with quality prospects and/or are ineffective in our marketing efforts, our future growth and profitability could be impacted.\nWe rely on our ability to attract and retain travelers through our direct and digital marketing and retention efforts. The effectiveness of these marketing efforts is highly dependent on our ability to integrate a multi-channel direct and digital marketing strategy, which requires us to manage several priorities: identifying and obtaining productive sources of prospects; executing direct mail strategies; securing attendance and conversion at our local informational meetings; increasing our digital presence and converting those leads into travelers; and retaining enrolled travelers. We may fail to adequately develop these marketing efforts due to a variety of factors including adverse changes in the direct-mail environment, the inability to convert our business to an integrated multi-channel direct mail and digital marketing approach, adverse changes to laws applicable to our sources of prospects, or changes to our reputation with potential participants and teachers. If we fail to fully develop or utilize our marketing efforts to attract and retain our customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur dependence on travel suppliers could delay or otherwise impair the delivery of our products and services, which would impact our reputation and could reduce our profitability.\nWe could be harmed by the activities of third parties that we do not control. We engage travel suppliers who provide certain products and services for us that we package to deliver our travel programs to our customers. These travel suppliers include airlines, hotels, bus lines, overseas coordinators and other travel industry participants. Consistent with industry practices, we currently have no long-term agreements with travel suppliers that obligate them to sell services or products through us on an ongoing basis. As a result, these travel suppliers generally can cancel or modify their agreements with us upon relatively short notice. In addition, there may be an actual decline in the quality of travel products and services provided by these suppliers, or the perception of such a decline by our participants, which could adversely affect our reputation and profitability. Any such decline in quality could also make it difficult for us to operate some aspects of our business, or expose us to liability for the actions of third party suppliers, which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance.\nIn addition, the loss of contracts, changes in our pricing agreements or commission arrangements, more restricted access to travel suppliers\u2019 products and services, less favorable public opinion of certain travel suppliers, or loss of deposits with travel suppliers that could go bankrupt, could all have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Likewise, if these third-party providers cease operations, temporarily or permanently, face financial distress or other business disruption, we could suffer increased costs and delays in our ability to provide similar services until an equivalent provider could be found, which could also have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the amount we pay for services received from foreign vendors and could adversely affect our gross margin results.\nThe majority of our travel programs are internationally based and many of our arrangements with our foreign-based suppliers require payment to be made in foreign currencies. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to foreign currencies will impact the cost of the services we provide. We generally enter into forward contracts for the delivery of foreign currencies and other financial instruments with less than two years\u2019 maturity to help manage program costs and hedge against foreign currency valuation changes. While these forward contracts can mitigate the effect on program costs and foreign currency exchange fluctuations, our program costs may nonetheless be impacted significantly in future periods by currency fluctuations. There can also be no assurance our hedging strategy will mitigate longer-term foreign exchange valuation trends. Depending on the strength of the U.S. dollar at the time the forward contracts or other financial instruments are entered into, its strength throughout the contracted period, and the accuracy of our projected enrollment volume, we could experience over-hedged positions, which may result in a gain or loss that must be recognized immediately in our consolidated financial statements.\nOur international operations involve additional risks.\nWe operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the United States. In addition to the risks outlined elsewhere in this section, our international operations are also subject to a number of other risks, including:\n\u2022 Regulatory requirements, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022 Potentially weaker enforcement of our contractual rights;\n\u2022 Increased payment and fraud risk; and\n\u2022 The application of international transactional taxes such as sales, use and occupancy taxes.\nOur failure to adequately manage these risks could adversely affect our growth in these international markets or could otherwise negatively impact our operations and financial results.\nFailure to comply with the applicable rules and regulatory standards or maintain the security of internal or customer data could adversely affect our reputation and subject us to substantial fines and penalties.\nOur business requires that we collect and retain large volumes of internal and customer data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information. This information is processed, summarized and reported by our various information systems and those of our service providers. The integrity and protection of all customer, employee, and company data is critical to us. We devote substantial time and incur costs to ensure proper compliance and safe guarding of such data. Our customers and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information.\nFurthermore, there are numerous laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other consumer data. The scope of these laws is increasingly demanding and, in some cases, evolving in a manner which may make laws and rules inconsistent between countries or in a way that may conflict with other rules. While we endeavor to comply with all applicable laws and other rules and codes relating to privacy and data protection, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another.\nA theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer personal or credit card information, employee, or company data could adversely impact our reputation and performance, and could result in significant remedial and other costs, fines and litigation. Any failure by us or our partners or other third parties to comply with the privacy policies, privacy-related obligations to our customers or other third parties, or privacy related legal obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or loss of our reputation and could cause our customers and others to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe could be negatively impacted by a security breach, through cyber-attack, cyber intrusion or otherwise.\nWe face the risk of a security breach, whether through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion over the internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization, or other significant disruption of our information technology networks and related systems. Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and information technology networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against these security breaches. A security breach or other significant disruption involving our information technology networks and related systems could cause harmful consequences:\n\u2022 Disruption of the proper functioning of these networks and systems and therefore our operations;\n\u2022 Unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information, which could harm us directly and indirectly, including if others use such information to compete against us;\n\u2022 Diversion of significant management attention and resources;\n\u2022 Contractual and other claims against us; and\n\u2022 Damage to our reputation.\nSecurity breaches could also cause travelers and potential users to lose confidence in our security, which would have a negative effect on the value of our brands. Any or all of these consequences could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nLitigation or other claims of liability may subject us to significant costs, judgments, fines and penalties that may not be covered by or may be in excess of available insurance coverage, may divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business, and may result in adverse publicity.\nDue to the nature of our business as well as being a publicly held company, we may be subject to liability claims related to management\u2019s decisions, securities claims, governmental investigations, business operations, or accidents or disasters causing injury to travelers on our programs, including claims for serious personal injury or death. We maintain liability insurance coverage for risks arising from the normal course of our business, including, but not limited to, professional and general liability insurance. There is no assurance that the insurance that we maintain will be sufficient to cover one or more claims that might arise in the future, that such insurance will cover any particular claim or loss, that our existing insurance or coverage amounts will continue to be available in the future, or that the applicable insurer will be solvent at the time we make a claim for any covered loss. Further, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and cost in the future. If someone successfully asserts one or more large uninsured claims against us, or one or more claims that exceed our insurance coverage, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition to the potential impact on our profitability and public perception, liability claims asserted against us could divert management\u2019s attention and our financial resources by requiring that management participate in the litigation process and defend the asserted claims. We have been the subject of such claims historically and have paid substantial amounts related\nto these claims that exceeded our recoveries under our insurance policies. There can be no assurance such claims will not occur in the future. See Note 12, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further information.\nWe experience significant fluctuations in our financial results from quarter to quarter related to the seasonality of our business and the timing differences between expenses and revenue which could impact investor confidence and cause share price volatility.\nOur business is highly seasonal and we anticipate that this trend will continue. The majority of our travel programs occur during the months of June and July each year, although we offer a limited number of travel programs throughout the remainder of the year. Revenue is recognized upon travel.\nIn contrast, the majority of our sales and marketing costs related to these travel programs have traditionally been highest in the third and fourth quarters, since the costs are typically incurred nine to twelve months prior to travel. While we are transitioning to a year-round sales and marketing approach which would spread our costs more evenly throughout the year, we continue to experience a long lead time between incurring sales and marketing costs and the receipt of traveler payments and the recording of associated revenue. This delay may result in operating results for a particular period that do not match the expectations of public market analysts and investors. Depending on their understanding of this aspect of our business, history with our company, and confidence in our business plans, our share price could be materially and adversely affected and may lead to higher volatility in our stock price. It is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which this seasonality and cyclicality may affect our stock price or business in future periods.\nWe are exposed to credit risk and interest rate risk that could affect our results of operations.\nA large percentage of our balance sheet consists of cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities which are exposed to concentrations of credit and interest rate risk. Although we place our cash and temporary cash investments with high credit quality institutions, at times, such balances may be in excess of the federal depository insurance limit or may be on deposit at institutions which are not covered by this insurance. If such institutions were to become insolvent while holding our cash, cash equivalents or available-for-sale securities in excess of the insurance limit, we could suffer losses or it could be necessary to obtain credit financing to operate our travel programs. Additionally, if interest rates were to fluctuate sharply, the value of our available-for-sale securities could be adversely affected. There is no assurance that we could respond timely enough to avoid losses and a swift, material change in these markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow.\nOur stock price is highly volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations and could continue to experience volatility in response to factors such as the following, some of which are out of our control:\n\u2022 Variations in our operating and financial results;\n\u2022 Operating and financial results that are significantly different than analysts\u2019 and investors\u2019 expectations;\n\u2022 Loss of our relationship with one of our worldwide partners or suppliers;\n\u2022 Speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022 A shift in the investment focus of our institutional shareholders;\n\u2022 Additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022 The limited trading volumes of our common stock; and\n\u2022 Price and volume fluctuations in stock markets in general.\nThis stock price volatility could also make us less attractive to certain investors.\nFailure to comply with current laws, rules and regulations or changes to such laws, rules and regulations and other legal uncertainties may adversely affect our business, financial performance or results of operations.\nOur business and financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in or interpretations of existing laws, rules and regulations or the adoption of new laws, rules and regulations, including those relating to licensing,\nconsumer protection, competition, and privacy. Unfavorable changes or interpretations could decrease demand for our products and services, limit marketing methods and capabilities, affect our profitability as a result of increased costs and/or subject us to additional liabilities.\nThe adoption of new laws, rules and regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws, rules and regulations, that restrict or unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which we provide travel services could require us to change certain aspects of our business or operations to ensure compliance, which could decrease demand for services, reduce revenues, increase costs and/or subject us to additional liabilities.", "PERMNO": 89321, "SIC": 4700, "TIC": "EPAX"}
