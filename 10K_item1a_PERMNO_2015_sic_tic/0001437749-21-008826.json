{"cik": "1589061", "company": "Gyrodyne, LLC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-04-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nGyrodyne\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and distribution potential are subject to risks customary for real property owners, as well as additional risks associated with Gyrodyne\u2019s strategic plan of positioning our remaining properties for sale at enhanced values and making distributions to our shareholders. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm the value of our properties and the magnitude of distributions to our shareholders, including causing Gyrodyne\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. The following summary of significant risk factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Gyrodyne or that Gyrodyne currently deems immaterial also may materially adversely affect us in future periods. For more information about forward-looking statements, see the section of this report entitled \u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Information\u201d below.\nThere are risks associated with seeking to enhance the value of certain properties.\nGyrodyne has been exploring enhancements of the value of our Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties by pursuing various entitlement opportunities. The Company believes that the cost of doing so will be exceeded by the resulting increase in value in such properties. Our efforts to seek enhancements of such properties are subject to various risks, including the following:\n\u25cf\nany delay or denial of a required entitlement or permit, including zoning, land use, environmental, emissions or other related permits, would adversely impact our property enhancement plans;\n\u25cf\nour analysis of site context, of demographic trends, of decisions of anchor institutions and of growth opportunities generally may not result in identifying the correct high value land uses and programmatic synergies;\n\u25cf\ncapital improvement costs and other expenses of such enhancements may be higher than projected, potentially making the project unfeasible or unprofitable;\n\u25cf\nwe may not have funds available or be able to obtain financing for these value-enhancement projects on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u25cf\nwe may experience delays in the repositioning or improvement process.\nFor these and other reasons, we cannot assure you that we will realize growth in the value of our Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties that exceeds our land entitlement costs or any at all, and as a result our ability to make distributions to our shareholders could be adversely affected.\nCommunity opposition could adversely impact our efforts to obtain entitlements and enhance the value of our properties.\nThe process of seeking required entitlements, permits and approvals is sometimes delayed or prevented due to community opposition and adverse publicity from neighboring property owners, members of the general public or non-governmental organizations, or other third parties and other factors beyond our control. The Company\u2019s efforts to seek entitlements, permits or other approvals have been the subject of protests by civic groups asserting environmental, traffic and congestion issues as well as adverse impact to the historic nature of the area. Such community opposition could lead to the denial of entitlements, permits or other approvals essential to our efforts to increase the value of our properties or to the imposition of restrictive conditions with which it is not practicable or feasible to comply and could impact our ability to enhance the value of our properties.\nWe cannot assure you of the exact timing and amount of any further distributions to our shareholders.\nOur estimate of net assets on December 31, 2020 is $22.49 million or $15.17 per common share. These estimated amounts are based on a number of assumptions and factors outside of our control. The process of disposing of our real property assets in an orderly manner designed to obtain the best value reasonably available for such assets may fail to create value or may result in lower than expected value and may result in lower than expected proceeds, or in no proceeds, for distribution to our shareholders. The actual nature, amount and timing of all distributions will be determined by Gyrodyne in our sole discretion, and will depend on, and could be delayed by, among other things, sales of our real estate assets, claim settlements with creditors, resolution of outstanding litigation matters, payment of incentive bonuses to those employees and directors who are vested under the Retention Bonus Plan and unanticipated or greater-than-expected expenses. Examples of uncertainties that could reduce the value of or eliminate distributions to our shareholders include unanticipated costs relating to:\n\u25cf\nfailure to achieve favorable values for our properties in their disposition;\n\u25cf\nthe defense, satisfaction or settlement of lawsuits or other claims that may be made or threatened against us in the future;\n\u25cf\ndelay or failure to settle claims; and\n\u25cf\nadministration and settlement of federal and state tax audits, if any.\nAs a result, we cannot determine with certainty the amount or timing of distributions to our shareholders.\nIf we are unable to find buyers for our properties at our expected sales prices, distributions may be delayed or reduced.\nIn calculating our estimated net assets, we assume that we will be able to find buyers for all our properties at our estimated amounts. However, we may have overestimated the sales prices that we will be able to obtain for these properties or underestimated the costs associated with such sales. If we are not able to find buyers for these properties in a reasonably timely manner or if we have overestimated the sales prices we will receive, distributions payable to holders of our common shares would be delayed or reduced. Furthermore, our estimated net assets are based on current market conditions, but real estate market values are constantly changing and tend to fluctuate with changes in interest rates, supply and demand dynamics, occupancy percentages, lease rates, the availability of suitable buyers, the perceived quality and dependability of income flows from tenancies and a number of other factors, both local and national. In addition, transactional fees and expenses, environmental contamination at our properties or unknown liabilities, if any, may adversely impact the net proceeds from those properties.\nDistributions to shareholders may be delayed or reduced as a result of sale agreement provisions that allow purchasers to terminate agreements and/or result in purchaser defaults.\nPurchase and sale agreements that we have entered into with respect to properties we previously sold contained provisions that gave the purchaser the right to terminate the agreement, for any reason or no reason, prior to the expiration of an evaluation period, and receive a refund of earnest money deposits, and it can be anticipated that agreements for future property sales will have similar provisions. The consummation of property sales for which we will enter into sale agreements in the future will also be subject to satisfaction of standard closing conditions. If any property sale contemplated by future sale agreements does not close because a purchaser exercises its termination right or defaults, or because of a failure of a closing condition or for any other reason, we will need to locate a new buyer for the property, which we may be unable to do promptly or at a price or on terms that are as favorable as contained in the original sale agreement. Many of the costs incurred due to a sale that fails to close are sunk costs with no future value and we will also incur additional costs involved in negotiating a new sale agreement for such property. These additional costs are not included in our projections. In the event that we incur these additional costs, distributions to our shareholders would be delayed or reduced.\nIlliquidity of real estate and lack of diversification may make it difficult for us to sell properties or achieve satisfactory returns in one or more properties within projected timelines.\nOur assets consist substantially of real properties which are relatively illiquid assets. We may encounter difficulty in disposing of properties when tenants vacate either at the expiration of the applicable lease or otherwise. When we decide to sell a particular property, our ability to do so and the prices we receive on their sale may be affected by many factors, including the number of potential buyers, the number of competing properties on the market and other market conditions, as well as whether the property is leased and if it is leased, the terms of the lease. As a result, we may be unable to sell our properties for an extended period of time at the values disclosed in our Consolidated Statement of Net Assets, which would adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. We expect to complete our process of pre-development enhancement and subsequent sale of all our properties by December 31, 2022. However, the illiquid nature of real estate and the short timeframe that we have chosen to complete pre-development value enhancement and subsequent sale of assets could adversely impact the prospects for achieving our value enhancement and sale objectives and may ultimately result in an extension of the timeline and or additional costs for achieving our pre-development property value enhancement and asset sale objectives.\nIf our land entitlement and liquidation costs or unpaid liabilities are greater than we expect, our distributions to our shareholders may be delayed or reduced.\nIn order to obtain certain entitlements, permits and approvals, we may be required to prepare and present additional data to governmental authorities pertaining to the potential adverse impact that any proposed activities may have on the environment, individually or in the aggregate. Certain approval procedures may require preparation of studies to assess the environmental impact of new sites or the expansion of existing sites. Compliance with these regulatory requirements is expensive and significantly lengthens the time needed to develop a site.\nThe liquidation basis of accounting requires us to accrue all costs associated with implementing and completing our plan of liquidation. Total liability for estimated costs in excess of estimated receipts during liquidation, inclusive of the costs listed above plus costs associated with the sale of real estate, payments made under the retention bonus plan and liquidating costs, total $11,552,940. The total amount of land entitlement costs, transaction fees and all operating and administrative costs in the liquidation is not yet known and, therefore, we have used estimates of these costs in calculating the amounts of our projected distributions to our shareholders. To the extent that we have underestimated these costs in calculating our projections or we incur unforeseen additional costs, our actual distributions may be lower than our estimated net assets. In addition, if the claims of our creditors are greater than we have anticipated, or we decide to acquire one or more insurance policies covering unknown or contingent claims against us, our distributions may be delayed or reduced. Further, if a reserve fund is established, payment of distributions to our holders of common shares may be delayed or reduced.\nStipulation of Settlement prohibits us from selling our remaining properties at prices below December 2014 appraised values.\nOn August 14, 2015, the Company entered a Stipulation of Settlement (the \"Settlement\") providing for the settlement of a putative class action lawsuit against the Company and certain related parties. Under the Settlement, Gyrodyne agreed that any sales of its properties would be effected only in arm's-length transactions at prices at or above their appraised values as of 2014.\nThe 2014 aggregate appraised value for our properties was approximately $100,000 higher than the 2013 aggregate appraised value for such properties. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate appraised value of our remaining unsold properties exceeded the respective 2014 aggregate appraised value for such properties.\nThe requirement in the Settlement that the Company sell its remaining properties at prices above the December 2014 appraised values could limit the options available to the Company. The Company believes that it is in the best interests of the shareholders to pursue certain pre-development enhancements to its remaining properties prior to seeking their ultimate disposition to a developer or other purchaser because doing so will result in higher estimated distributions as compared with selling the properties with their current zoning and entitlements. The Company may also entertain offers from potential buyers who may be willing to pay prices for the properties in their current entitlement and zoning status that the Company finds more attractive from a timing or value perspective than might be achievable through completing an entitlement process. If the Company receives an offer prior to the completion of the entitlement process that it believes is in the best interests of the shareholders, it may nevertheless be prevented from consummating such transaction because of the price floor set in the Settlement. In addition, a severe downturn in the general economy or in the real estate market, or other negative factors beyond our control, may drive down the values of commercial real estate properties, or otherwise result in the values of our remaining properties being reduced to levels below the 2014 appraised values, in which case we may be prohibited under the Settlement from selling such properties. Such limitation on the options available to the Company may make it more difficult to accomplish our stated objective of completing the process of seeking entitlements and selling assets by December 31, 2022.\nFurthermore, the Stipulation\u2019s price floor provision does not factor in land entitlement costs that may be incurred in enhancing the value of any particular property. Although the Company intends only to engage in value enhancement efforts and incur land entitlement costs if it reasonably believes that property values will increase more than the amount of such costs, and the Retention Bonus Plan as amended properly incentivizes the Company to do so by calculating the bonus pool as a percentage of the excess of gross sales proceeds from the sale of each property over the designated appraised value as adjusted by land entitlement costs, the price floor provision may nevertheless create a perverse incentive for the Company to incur certain land entitlement costs to increase the value of a property beyond its stipulated price floor even if the land entitlement costs incurred exceed the amount of the increase.\nRisks incidental to real estate ownership and management.\nBecause our business plan is to pursue the opportunistic disposition of our properties, we do not expect to make any further investments other than to enhance the values of the Flowerfield and Cortlandt Manor properties which may include acquisitions of land and/or executing land swaps. Accordingly, an investment in Gyrodyne depends upon the financial performance and the value of our current portfolio of properties, which properties are subject to the risks normally associated with the ownership and management of rental properties and real estate in general. The risks associated with ownership and management of rental properties include the non-performance of lease obligations by tenants, leasehold improvements that will be costly or difficult to remove should it become necessary to re-rent the leased space for other uses, covenants in certain retail leases that limit the types of tenants to which available space can be rented (which may limit demand or reduce the rents realized on re-renting), rights of termination of leases due to events of casualty or condemnation affecting the leased space or the property or due to interruption of the tenant's quiet enjoyment of the leased premises, and obligations of a landlord to restore the leased premises or the property following events of casualty or condemnation. The risks associated with ownership and management of real estate in general include:\n\u2022 adverse changes in general and local economic conditions which affect the demand for real estate assets;\n\u2022\ncompetition from other properties;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in interest rates;\n\u2022\nreduced availability of financing;\n\u2022\nthe cyclical nature of the real estate industry and possible oversupply of, or reduced demand for, properties in the markets in which our investments are located;\n\u2022\nthe attractiveness of our properties to tenants and purchasers;\n\u2022\nhow well we manage our properties;\n\u2022\nchanges in market rental rates and our ability to rent space on favorable terms;\n\u2022\nthe financial condition of our tenants including their becoming insolvent and bankrupt;\n\u2022\nthe need to periodically renovate, repair and re-lease space and the costs thereof; and\n\u2022\nincreases in maintenance, insurance and operating costs.\nOur shareholders may be liable to our creditors for an amount up to the amount distributed by us if our reserves for payments to creditors are inadequate\nIn the event our shareholders receive distributions from Gyrodyne at a time when the Company is insolvent or is rendered insolvent thereby and there are insufficient funds to pay any creditors who seek payment of claims against Gyrodyne, shareholders could be held liable under New York State\u2019s fraudulent conveyance laws for payments made to them and could be required to return all or a part of distributions made to them. Under the New York Uniform Voidable Transactions Act signed into law on December 6, 2019, the reach-back period for voidable transaction claims other than claims based on fraud is reduced from six years to four years with respect to distributions made on or after April 4, 2020.\nOur properties may subject us to known and unknown liabilities.\nOur existing properties may have known and unknown liabilities for which we would have no recourse, or only limited recourse, to the former owners of such properties. As a result, if a liability were successfully asserted against us based upon ownership of an acquired property, we might be required to pay significant sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our financial results, cash flow and proceeds available for distribution. Unknown liabilities relating to properties could include:\n\u2022\nliabilities for clean-up of pre-existing disclosed or undisclosed environmental contamination;\n\u2022\nclaims by tenants, vendors or other persons arising on account of actions or omissions of the former owners of the properties; and\n\u2022\nliabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business.\nIf we are unable to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and/or to lease currently available space, if tenants default under their leases or other obligations to us or if our cash flow is otherwise less than we expect, distributions to our shareholders may be delayed or reduced.\nThe sales proceeds that could be generated from opportunistic dispositions of our real properties depend in large part on occupancy and rental rates, our success in renting currently available space and the existence of any significant tenant defaults that were not subsequently cured. In calculating the estimated distributions, it was assumed that we would maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space, that we would be able to rent currently available space in the ordinary course and that we would not experience any significant tenant defaults during the process of seeking entitlements and selling assets that were not subsequently cured. Negative trends in one or more of these factors may adversely affect the resale value of the properties, which would reduce our distributions. Disposition proceeds and related distributions will be reduced to the extent that we receive less rental income than we expect. We may also decide in the event of a tenant default to restructure the lease, which could require us to substantially reduce the rent payable to us under the lease or make other modifications that are unfavorable to us.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the financial condition of our tenants.\nOur tenants may experience a downturn in their business resulting in their inability to make rental payments when due. In addition, a tenant may seek the protection of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws, which could result in the rejection and termination of such tenant\u2019s lease and cause a reduction in our cash flow. We cannot evict a tenant solely because of its filing for bankruptcy. A bankruptcy court, however, may authorize a tenant to reject and terminate its lease. In such a case, our claim against the tenant for past due rent and unpaid future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent owed under the lease. In any event, it is unlikely that a bankrupt tenant will pay the entire amount it owes us under a lease. The loss of rental payments from tenants would likely reduce proceeds from real property dispositions and distributions from such proceeds.\nThe Coronavirus pandemic has affected and will likely for the foreseeable future affect the markets in which our tenants operate and otherwise impact our facilities, which will adversely impact the businesses of our tenants and, in turn, our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to pay distributions. Not-for-profit corporations and tenants that are neither medical offices nor part of or affiliated with SBU or SBU Hospital, which together account for approximately 37% ($776,000) of the Company\u2019s projected annual rental revenues for 2021, are expected to be adversely affected disproportionately by the economic ramifications of COVID-19.\nThe loss of a major tenant could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe are and expect that we will continue to be subject to a degree of tenant concentration at certain of our operating properties. As indicated above, we are subject to risks associated with the financial condition of our tenants. In the event that a tenant occupying a significant portion of one or more of our properties or whose rental income represents a significant portion of the rental revenue at such property or properties were to experience financial weakness, default on its lease, elect not to renew its lease or file bankruptcy it would negatively impact our financial condition and, as a result, our distributions. Our existing leases with Stony Brook University Hospital and affiliates comprise approximately 21% of our total rentable square feet and the annual rent is expected to represent approximately 28% of our annual rental revenue for 2021.\nThe largest medical tenant in the Cortlandt Manor Medical Center represents 10% of our total rentable square feet as of December 31, 2020. The annual rent from such tenant is expected to represent approximately 24% of our annual rental revenue for 2021.\nWe may experience increased operating costs, which might reduce our estimated net assets and the sales prices received for our properties.\nOur properties are subject to increases in operating expenses such as for cleaning, electricity, heating, ventilation and air conditioning, administrative costs and other costs associated with security, landscaping and repairs and maintenance of our properties. In general, under our leases with tenants, we pass through all or a portion of these costs to them. There can be no assurance that tenants will actually bear the full burden of these higher costs, or that such increased costs will not lead them, or other prospective tenants, to seek space elsewhere. If operating expenses increase, the availability of other comparable space in the geographic markets of our properties might limit our ability to increase rents; if operating expenses increase without a corresponding increase in revenues, our profitability could diminish thereby reducing our estimated proceeds on disposition of real properties and limit the amount and likely delay the timing of our distributions.\nSome of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.\nWe use our discretion in determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance, with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance coverage on our properties at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms. This may result in insurance coverage that, in the event of a substantial loss, would not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of the property and also may result in certain losses being totally uninsured. Inflation, changes in building codes, zoning or other land use ordinances, environmental considerations or other factors might not make it feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after such building has been damaged or destroyed. Under such circumstances, the insurance proceeds, if any, received by us might not be adequate to restore our economic position with respect to such property.\nWe may incur costs to comply with environmental laws.\nThe obligation to pay for the cost of complying with existing environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, as well as the cost of complying with future legislation, may increase our operating costs. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on or under the property. Environmental laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances and whether or not such substances originated from the property. Insurance that we maintain related to potential environmental issues on our properties may not be adequate to cover all possible contingencies.\nOur business, operations and timelines for pursuing entitlements, property sales and distributions of proceeds could be adversely affected by the Coronavirus pandemic.\nThe Coronavirus pandemic has affected and will likely for the foreseeable future affect the markets in which our tenants operate and otherwise impact our facilities, which in turn will adversely impact the businesses of our tenants and, in turn, our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to pay distributions.\nNot-for-profit corporations and tenants that are neither medical offices nor part of or affiliated with SBU or SBU Hospital, which together account for approximately 37% ($776,000) of the Company\u2019s projected annual rental revenues for 2021, are expected to be adversely affected disproportionately by the economic ramifications of COVID-19. Although, the duration and full extent of this disruption, the impact of COVID-19 on our future results could be significant and will largely depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus, the success of actions taken to contain or treat the coronavirus and reactions by consumers, companies, governmental entities and capital markets. We are actively working with our tenants to manage and mitigate the impact to COVID-19 on the Company\u2019s operations, liquidity and resulting Net Asset Value.\nThe COVID-19 public health crisis may also adversely impact our efforts to secure entitlements and the sale of our real estate. Furthermore, the real estate market is expected also to be adversely affected which could further negatively impact the timing of sales and the resulting value of our real estate.\nThe extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company's operational and financial performance and ultimately its Net Asset Value, will depend in part on the duration and spread of the outbreak and related governmental or other regulatory actions. The Company\u2019s ability to operate seamlessly and limit any adverse impact on its forecasted Net Asset Value will depend in part on whether any of its key employees is infected by the Coronavirus and becomes ill from COVID-19.\nOur common shares are thinly traded and there may not be an active, liquid trading market for our common shares.\nOur common shares are thinly traded and have substantially less liquidity than the average trading market for many other publicly traded companies. Thinly traded stocks can be more volatile than stock trading in an active public market. Our stock price has been volatile in the past and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These factors include but are not limited to our announcement of developments related to our plan to sell our properties opportunistically (some of which are or may be the subject of enhancement efforts), stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers, news reports of issues related to REITs or other real property owners and the real estate market and market forces generally. Over the past several years, the stock market has experienced a high level of price and volume volatility, and market prices for the stock of many companies, including those in the real estate sector, have experienced wide price fluctuations that have not necessarily been related to operating performance. Our stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance. General market declines or market volatility in the future, especially in the real estate sector of the economy, could adversely affect the price of our common shares, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices. There is no guarantee that an active trading market for our common shares will be maintained on Nasdaq, or that the volume of trading will be sufficient to allow for timely trades. Investors may not be able to sell their shares quickly or at the latest market price if trading in our stock is not active or if trading volume is limited. In addition, if trading volume in our common shares is limited, trades of relatively small numbers of shares may have a disproportionate effect on the market price of our common shares. Therefore, our shareholders may not be able to sell their shares at the volume, prices or times that they desire.\nIf our common shares are delisted from Nasdaq, shareholders may find it difficult to dispose of their shares.\nWe believe we are currently in compliance with all of our Nasdaq listing requirements. Nevertheless, there are no assurances that we will be able to sustain long-term compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s stockholders\u2019 equity requirement or minimum bid price requirement for continued listing, particularly as we reduce our overall assets through the distribution of sales proceeds to our shareholders. If we fail to maintain compliance with applicable Nasdaq listing requirements, our common shares may be delisted by Nasdaq involuntarily. In addition, even if we are successful in maintaining compliance with applicable Nasdaq listing requirements, our board of directors may decide that the costs of compliance and the demands of management time and Company resources required to maintain our Nasdaq listing are greater than the benefits received by the Company and its shareholders from being a listed company and that, accordingly, consistent with other cash management and cost reduction measures that we have implemented, we should voluntarily delist from the Nasdaq Capital Market. If our common shares were delisted from Nasdaq voluntarily or involuntarily, trading of our common shares most likely will be conducted in the over-the-counter market on an electronic bulletin Board established for unlisted securities such as OTCQX, OTCBX or OTC Pink which will reduce the market liquidity of our common shares. Delisting may result in lower levels of ownership and trading by institutional shareholders, who are generally guided by quantitative and qualitative investment standards such as market capitalization, minimum share price and liquidity, which in turn often produces lower trading volumes and reduced liquidity. As a result, an investor would find it more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations for the price of, our common shares. Also, many brokers will not allow customers to hold non-listed securities in managed accounts or place restrictions which inhibit holding or trading, and it is generally understood that brokers will not recommend non-listed securities to retail clients, perhaps not as official policy but rather as a practical reality. We cannot assure you that our common shares, if delisted from Nasdaq voluntarily, or if they would be delisted involuntarily by Nasdaq, will be listed on another national securities exchange or quoted on an over-the counter quotation system.\nWe do not anticipate making distributions other than distributions from property dispositions or of liquidation proceeds.\nWe have not paid any dividends other than the following special dividends/distributions:\n\u25cf\nJune 15, 2016- A special distribution of $9.25 per share.\n\u25cf\nSeptember 15, 2016- A special distribution of $1.50 per share.\n\u25cf\nJuly 7, 2017 - A special distribution of $1.00 per share.\nWe have a history of operating losses and we anticipate operating losses in the future. There can be no guarantee that we will have income to distribute other than proceeds from the sale of properties or of the Company, and we may not make any dividends or distributions in the future other than distributions of proceeds on the sale of the Company or any of our assets.\nThe value of our medical office park may be affected by factors in the healthcare industry.\nApproximately 34,000 square feet of our rentable space and approximately 33% of our gross revenues for 2020 was attributable to our medical office property. The medical office property is subject to various operating risks common to the healthcare industry, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022\ncompetition from other medical properties in our markets;\n\u2022\nover-building of medical parks in our markets, which adversely affects occupancy and revenues at our properties;\n\u2022\nhospitals servicing the local markets increasing their interest in employing private practitioners or increasing their real estate portfolio of medical office space for rent or real estate/medical practice related joint ventures;\n\u2022\nreductions in medical reimbursements from Medicaid and Medicare which directly impact private practitioners;\n\u2022\nunknown or unidentified adverse consequences from the recent federal healthcare legislation on private practitioners will adversely affect our medical properties in the form of rent rates and tenant reimbursements; and\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations, fiscal policies and ordinances.\nInvestment in medical parks is capital intensive.\nOur medical properties require periodic capital expenditures and renovation to remain competitive. Maintaining our occupancy upon renewals or locating new tenants may require rent concessions, tenant improvements or a combination of both. Additionally, the recent federal healthcare legislation has caused some medical professionals to increase their space requirements. Our ability to relocate our tenants into more suitable space within our medical parks may be limited due to the size of the suites currently vacant and the willingness of tenants to relocate within the building. Our ability to fund capital expenditures may be limited.\nFederal health care legislation has affected medical office real estate.\nOur tenants in our Cortlandt Manor property are healthcare service providers. The healthcare industry is currently experiencing rapid regulatory changes and uncertainty\u037e changes in the demand for and methods of delivering healthcare services\u037e changes in third-party reimbursement policies\u037e expansion of insurance providers into patient care\u037e continuing pressure by private and governmental payors to reduce payments to providers of services\u037e and increased scrutiny of billing, referral and other practices by governmental authorities. These factors may adversely affect the economic performance of some or all of our medical office tenants and, in turn, our performance.\nOur tenants are also subject to extensive federal, state, and local licensure laws, regulations and industry standards governing business operations, the physical plant and structure, patient rights and privacy and security of health information. Our tenants\u2019 failure to comply with any of these laws could result in loss of licensure, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines or other penalties, suspension or exclusion from the government sponsored Medicare and Medicaid programs, loss of accreditation or certification, or closure of the facility. In addition, efforts by third-party payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs and private insurance carriers, including health maintenance organizations and other health plans, impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls upon healthcare provider operations (through changes in reimbursement rates and methodologies, discounted fee structures, the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk or otherwise). Our tenants may also face significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees, all of which could impact their ability to pay rent or other obligations to us.\nIlliquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties and harm our financial condition.\nBecause real estate investments are relatively illiquid, our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in the portfolio in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions is limited.\nThe real estate market is affected by many factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nadverse changes in international, national, regional and local economic and market conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates and in the cost and terms of debt financing;\n\u2022\nabsence of liquidity in credit markets which limits the availability and amount of debt financing;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations, fiscal policies and ordinances;\n\u2022\nthe ongoing need for capital improvements, particularly in older structures;\n\u2022\nchanges in operating expenses; and\n\u2022\ncivil unrest, acts of God, including earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters, and acts of war or terrorism, including the consequences of the terrorist acts, such as those that occurred on September 11, 2001.\nWe are subject to risks stemming from the New York State budgets.\nOur industrial park borders Stony Brook University and our leases with the University, including leases with the University\u2019s affiliates, represent over 21% of our overall rentable space. The New York State budget puts additional pressure on Stony Brook University, part of the State University of New York system, to cut costs. Many of our tenants service the local area and may be adversely affected by a reduction in business from Stony Brook University. Stony Brook University and its affiliates currently have three leases with Gyrodyne comprising approximately 34,000 square feet and $648,000 in annual revenue.\nGeographic concentration of our properties will make our business vulnerable to economic downturns in the New York metropolitan area.\nAll our remaining properties are located in the New York metropolitan area, specifically Northern Westchester and eastern Long Island. Economic conditions in these locations will significantly affect our revenues and the value of our properties. Business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, changing demographics, the COVID-19 pandemic and other similar factors may adversely affect the economic climate in these areas. Any resulting oversupply or reduced demand for space in the New York metropolitan area would therefore have a disproportionate negative impact on our revenues.\nWe are subject to risks associated with renovations and capital improvements.\nOur properties have an ongoing need for renovations and other capital improvements, including replacement of HVAC systems, parking lots, and other structural items. Tenants often require us to make periodic capital improvements as a condition of renewing leases. On average, we spend approximately $225,000 on capital improvements to our real estate portfolio (excluding tenant improvements for long term tenants who expand their suites). Capital improvements and renovation projects may give rise to the following risks:\n\u2022\npossible environmental problems;\n\u2022\nconstruction cost overruns and delays;\n\u2022\na possible shortage of available cash to fund capital improvements and the related possibility that financing for these capital improvements may not be available to us on affordable terms; and\n\u2022\nuncertainties as to market demand or a loss of market demand after capital improvements have begun.\nThe costs associated with capital improvements on our properties could adversely affect our financial condition.\nCybersecurity risks and cyber incidents may adversely affect our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our tenant and other business relationships, all of which could negatively impact our financial condition.\nA cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our information resources. These incidents may be an intentional attack or an unintentional event and could involve gaining unauthorized access to our information systems for purposes of misappropriating assets, stealing confidential information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. The result of these incidents may include disrupted operations, misstated or unreliable financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection and insurance costs, litigation and damage to our tenant and investor relationships. As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our information systems, both internal and those we have outsourced. There is no guarantee that any processes, procedures and internal controls we have implemented or will implement will prevent cyber intrusions, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition, operations, tenant and other business relationships or confidential information.\nOur mortgage indebtedness could adversely impact the value of our shareholders\u2019 investment if the value of the property securing the debt falls or if we are forced to refinance the debt during adverse economic conditions.\nThe Company secured a non-revolving credit line for up to $3,000,000 (the \u201cOriginal Line\u201d) with a bank, which closed on March 21, 2018. The Original Line included an interest only phase for the first eight months of the loan (\u201cInterest-Only Phase\u201d). The Company amended and extended the Original Line which included extending the conversion date of the Interest-Only Phase to the earlier of April 30, 2021 or upon drawing down a total of $3,000,000 after which it automatically converts to a permanent loan maturing on the earlier of April 30, 2028 or 84 months after conversion to a permanent loan (the \u201cPermanent Phase\u201d). The interest rate, per the latest modification, during the Interest-Only Phase is a variable rate equal to the daily highest prime rate published by the Wall Street Journal plus 150 basis points (1.5% rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent), adjusted daily, but shall not be less than 4.75%. During the Permanent Phase, the Company will pay interest at a fixed rate based on the Federal Home Loan Bank rate for a 7-year maturity as made available by the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York plus a margin of 200 basis points (2%) rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent, but shall not be less than 3.85%, plus principal based on a 20-year amortization period. The Permanent Phase interest rate currently would be 3.85%.\nTo secure access to additional working capital through the final sale date of the Flowerfield industrial buildings, the Company secured a second loan evidenced by a non-revolving business line of credit agreement and promissory note with the Original Line bank for up to $3,000,000, which closed on January 24, 2019. This loan included an interest only phase for the first twenty-four months of the loan (\u201cInterest-Only Phase\u201d) after which it automatically converts to a permanent loan maturing on January 20, 2028 (84 months after conversion to a permanent loan) (the \u201cPermanent Phase\u201d). The Company amended and extended the line which included extending the conversion date of the Interest-Only Phase to the earlier of May 20, 2021 or upon drawing down a total of $3,000,000 after which it automatically converts to a permanent loan maturing on the earlier of May 20, 2028 or 84 months after conversion to a permanent loan. The interest rate during the Interest-Only Phase shall be a variable rate equal to the daily highest prime rate published by the Wall Street Journal plus 100 basis points (1% rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent), but in no event less than 4.75%. During the Permanent Phase, the Company will pay interest at a fixed rate based on the Federal Home Loan Bank rate for a 7-year maturity as made available by the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York plus a margin of 200 basis points (2%) rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent, but shall not be less than 3.85%, plus principal based on a 20-year amortization period. Permanent Phase interest rate currently would be 3.85%.\nTo secure access to additional working capital, the Company, through its subsidiary GSD Cortlandt, LLC (\u201cGSD Cortlandt\u201d) secured a loan evidenced by a non-revolving business line of credit agreement and promissory note with the Original Line bank for up to $2,500,000 which closed on July 16, 2020. The term is 24 months, with an option to extend for an additional 12 months. The interest rate is a variable rate equal to the daily highest prime rate published by the Wall Street Journal plus 100 basis points (1%), rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent, but in no event less than four and three quarters percent (4.75%). The terms of the loan originally limited access to certain amounts, contingent upon GSD Cortlandt securing purchase agreements for one or both Cortlandt Property lots. On February 22, 2021, the Company amended this line to remove the contingency of contracts in order to draw. Advances of $379,765 and $670,235, were drawn at closing and on January 28, 2021, respectively. The balance of $1,450,000 is available to be drawn upon the Lender\u2019s discretion.\nIncreases in interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments and adversely affect our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders.\nAs of March 21, 2018, we had a non-revolving credit line for up to $3,000,000 (the \u201cOriginal Line\u201d) with a bank. The credit line provides for an interest only phase for the first eight months of the loan (\u201cInterest-Only Phase\u201d) after which it will automatically convert to a permanent loan maturing on November 30, 2025 (84 months after conversion to a permanent loan) (the \u201cPermanent Phase\u201d). The interest rate during the Interest-Only Phase will be a variable rate equal to the daily highest prime rate published by the Wall Street Journal plus 100 basis points (1% rounded up to the nearest 1/8 percent). During the Permanent Phase, the Company will pay interest at a fixed rate. Increases in interest rates during the Interest-Only Phase would increase our interest costs, which could reduce our cash flows and our ability to pay distributions to shareholders.\nOn January 24, 2019, the Company amended and extended the Original Line which included extending the conversion date of the interest only phase to the earlier of January 20, 2020 (which has since been extended to April 30, 2021) or upon drawing down a total of $3,000,000 after which it automatically converts to a permanent loan maturing the earlier of January 20, 2027 or 84 months after conversion to a permanent loan (the \u201cPermanent Phase\u201d). The Company amended and extended the Original Line which included extending the maturity date of the Interest-Only Phase to the earlier of April 30, 2021 or upon drawing down a total of $3,000,000 after which it automatically converts to a permanent loan maturing on the earlier of April 30, 2028 or 84 months after conversion to a permanent loan.\nOn January 24, 2019, the wholly owned subsidiary, GSD Flowerfield LLC closed on a working capital non-revolving line of credit of $3,000,000 secured by approximately 31.8 acres of the Flowerfield Industrial Park including the related buildings and leases and guaranteed by the Company. There is an interest only phase for the first twenty-four months of the loan (\u201cInterest-Only Phase\u201d) after which it automatically converts to a permanent loan maturing on January 20, 2028 (84 months after conversion to a permanent loan) (the \u201cPermanent Phase\u201d). The Company amended and extended the line which included extending the conversion date of the Interest-Only Phase to the earlier of May 20, 2021 or upon drawing down a total of $3,000,000 after which it automatically converts to a permanent loan maturing on the earlier of May 20, 2028 or 84 months after conversion to a permanent loan (the \u201cPermanent Phase\u201d).\nTo secure access to additional working capital, the Company, through its subsidiary GSD Cortlandt, LLC (\u201cGSD Cortlandt\u201d) secured a loan evidenced by a non-revolving business line of credit agreement and promissory note with the Original Line bank for up to $2,500,000 which closed on July 16, 2020. The term is 24 months, with an option to extend for an additional 12 months.\nSee \u201cBusiness-Financing Strategy\u201d, above, for more detailed disclosure.\nChanges in federal tax law could adversely affect the tax treatment of distributions to our shareholders.\nLegislative, regulatory or administrative changes could be enacted or promulgated at any time, either prospectively or with retroactive effect, and may adversely affect the Company and our shareholders. Gyrodyne is not subject to an entity level income tax but rather is treated as a partnership for tax purposes, with its items of income, gain, deduction, loss and credit being reported on the Company\u2019s information return, on Form 1065, and allocated annually on Schedule K-1 to our shareholders pro rata. Tax legislation informally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201c2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d) was signed into law on December 22, 2017, generally effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. In addition to modifying income tax rates for individuals and corporations, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made certain changes to the tax treatment for pass-through entities, such as Gyrodyne.\nLoss of key management personnel.\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon the continuing efforts of Gary Fitlin, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and Peter Pitsiokos, our Chief Operating Officer. We have programs in place that have been designed to motivate, reward and retain such executive officers, including employment agreements and our Retention Bonus Plan. Nevertheless, the loss or unavailability of either of our executive officers due to retirement, resignation, COVID-19 or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in general, and our efforts to position our properties to maximize values and distributions to shareholders in particular, if we are unable to retain our executive officers.", "PERMNO": 40468, "SIC": 6512, "TIC": "GYRO"}
