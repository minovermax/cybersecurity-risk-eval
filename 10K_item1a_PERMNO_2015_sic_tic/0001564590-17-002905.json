{"cik": "1142417", "company": "NEXSTAR MEDIA GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the information contained in this document. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that the Company faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company\u2019s business operations. If any of those risks actually occurs, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and the Company\u2019s actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page one of this document.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nGeneral trends in the television industry could adversely affect demand for television advertising as consumers migrate to alternative media, including the Internet, for entertainment.\nTelevision viewing among consumers has been negatively impacted by the increasing availability of alternative media, including the Internet. As a result, in recent years demand for television advertising has been declining and demand for advertising in alternative media has been increasing, and we expect this trend to continue.\nThe networks have begun streaming some of their programming on the Internet and other distribution platforms simultaneously with, or in close proximity to, network programming broadcast on local television stations, including those we own or provide services to. These and other practices by the networks dilute the exclusivity and value of network programming originally broadcast by the local stations and may adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of our stations.\nThe Company\u2019s substantial debt could limit its ability to grow and compete.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company had $2.3 billion of debt, which represented 93.3% of the total combined capitalization.\nIn January 2017, in connection with our Merger with Media General, certain then-existing indebtedness of the Company and Media General were extinguished, including the Company\u2019s term loans and revolving loans with a principal balance of $668.8 million and $2.0 million, respectively, and Media General\u2019s outstanding term loans and senior unsecured notes with a principal balance of approximately $1.4 billion and $275.0 million, respectively. The Cash Consideration of the Merger, the refinancing of the then-existing indebtedness of the Company and Media General, and the related fees and expenses were funded through a combination of borrowings of approximately $3.1 billion under the Company\u2019s new senior secured credit facilities, proceeds from the $900.0 million 5.625% notes, and proceeds from certain station divestitures. We also inherited the $400.0 million 5.875% Notes issued by LIN TV, which became an indirect subsidiary of Nexstar as of the Closing Date. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Merger with Media General\u201d and Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nOn February 17, 2017, we prepaid $75.0 million of the outstanding principal balance under our Term Loan B, funded by cash on hand. On February 27, 2017, we called the entire $525.0 million principal amount under our 6.875% Notes at a redemption price equal to 103.438% of the principal plus any accrued and unpaid interest, funded by the new borrowings described above.\nThe Company\u2019s high level of debt could have important consequences to our business. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nlimit the Company\u2019s ability to borrow additional funds or obtain additional financing in the future;\n\u2022\nlimit the Company\u2019s ability to pursue acquisition opportunities;\n\u2022\nexpose the Company to greater interest rate risk since the interest rate on borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities is variable;\n\u2022\nlimit the Company\u2019s flexibility to plan for and react to changes in our business and our industry; and\n\u2022\nimpair our ability to withstand a general downturn in our business and place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged.\nSee Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Contractual Obligations\u201d for disclosure of the approximate aggregate amount of principal indebtedness scheduled to mature.\nThe Company could also incur additional debt in the future. The terms of the Company\u2019s senior secured credit facilities, as well as the indentures governing our 6.125% senior unsecured notes (\u201c6.125% Notes\u201d), the 5.625% Notes and the 5.875% Notes, limit, but do not prohibit the Company from incurring substantial amounts of additional debt. To the extent the Company incurs additional debt, we would become even more susceptible to the leverage-related risks described above.\nThe agreements governing the Company\u2019s debt contain various covenants that limit management\u2019s discretion in the operation of our business.\nThe terms of the Company\u2019s senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our 6.125% Notes, 5.625% Notes, and 5.875% Notes contain various restrictive covenants customary for arrangements of these types that restrict our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt and issue preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make other distributions;\n\u2022\nmake investments and other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake acquisitions;\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nsell assets or stock of our subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s senior secured credit facilities require us to maintain or meet certain financial ratios, including maximum total and first-lien leverage ratios and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. Future financing agreements may contain similar, or even more restrictive, provisions and covenants. As a result of these restrictions and covenants, management\u2019s ability to operate our business at its discretion is limited, and we may be unable to compete effectively, pursue acquisitions or take advantage of new business opportunities, any of which could harm our business.\nIf we fail to comply with the restrictions in present or future financing agreements, a default may occur. A default could allow creditors to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. A default could also allow creditors to foreclose on any collateral securing such debt.\nThe credit agreement governing our obligations under our senior secured credit facility contains covenants that require us to comply with certain financial ratios, including maximum total and first-lien ratios and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The covenants, which are calculated on a quarterly basis, include the combined results of the Company. The credit agreements governing Mission\u2019s, Marshall\u2019s and Shield\u2019s obligations under their senior secured credit facilities do not contain financial covenant ratio requirements; however, they include events of default if we do not comply with all covenants contained in the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facility.\nThe Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its debt service requirements.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to service its debt depends on its ability to generate the necessary cash flow. Generation of the necessary cash flow is partially subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control. The Company cannot assure you that its business will generate cash flow from operations, that future borrowings will be available to the Company under its current or any replacement credit facilities, or that it will be able to complete any necessary financings, in amounts sufficient to enable the Company to fund its operations or pay its debts and other obligations, or to fund its liquidity needs. If the Company is not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt obligations, it may need to refinance or restructure its debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. Additional financing may not be available in sufficient amounts, at times or on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all. If the Company is unable to meet its debt service obligations, its lenders may determine to stop making loans to the Company, and/or the Company\u2019s lenders or other holders of its debt could accelerate and declare due all outstanding obligations due under the respective agreements, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe owners of the VIEs may make decisions regarding the operation of their respective stations that could reduce the amount of cash we receive under our local service agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the VIEs are each 100% owned by independent third parties. These entities owned and operated 30 full power television stations. We have entered into local service agreements with these VIEs, pursuant to which we provide services to their stations. In return for the services we provide, we receive substantially all of the VIEs\u2019 available cash, after satisfaction of their operating costs and any debt obligations.\nOn December 3, 2012, Mission entered into a fourth amended and restated credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, UBS Securities LLC, as syndication agent, joint lead arranger and joint book manager, RBC Capital Markets, as documentation agent, joint lead arranger and joint book manager, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as joint lead arranger and joint book manager, and a syndicate of other lenders, which provides for a first-lien credit facility (the \u201cMission Facility\u201d). As of December 31, 2016, the Mission Facility consisted of a term loan with an outstanding balance of approximately $225.9 million maturing on October 1, 2020 and a maximum revolving credit facility of $8.0 million, of which none was drawn and outstanding, maturing on December 3, 2017. In January 2017, Mission refinanced its existing debt with a new term loan of $232.0 million due 2024 and a new revolving credit facility of $3.0 million, of which none was drawn and outstanding.\nOn December 1, 2014, Marshall entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, collateral agent and L/C issuer (the \u201cMarshall Facility\u201d). As of December 31, 2016, the Marshall Facility consisted of a term loan with an outstanding balance of $55.3 million maturing on June 28, 2018 and an outstanding loan under its revolving credit facility of $2.0 million maturing on December 3, 2017. In January 2017, Marshall refinanced its existing debt with a new term loan of $51.3 million due 2018 and a new revolving credit facility of $3.0 million due 2022, all of which was drawn and outstanding.\nWe guarantee all of the obligations incurred under the Mission Facility and the Marshall Facility. Mission, White Knight and Parker has granted purchase options that permit Nexstar to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each Mission, White Knight or Parker station, subject to FCC consent. These purchase options are freely exercisable or assignable by Nexstar without consent or approval by Mission, White Knight or Parker.\nIn connection with the Merger, we have stepped into Media General\u2019s local service agreements with VIEs that own and operate an additional 10 stations. Additionally, we have assumed Media General\u2019s rights under the purchase options granted by Shield, Vaughan, Tamer and Super Towers that permit Nexstar to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each of these VIEs\u2019 stations at any time, subject to FCC consent. Simultaneous with the Merger, Shield entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the \u201cShield Facility\u201d). As of the Closing Date, the Shield Facility consisted of a term loan with an outstanding balance of $24.8 million due 2022, which we guarantee.\nWe do not own the VIEs or any of their respective television stations. However, we are deemed under U.S. GAAP to have controlling financial interests in the consolidated VIEs because of (1) the local service agreements Nexstar has with the VIEs\u2019 stations, (2) Nexstar\u2019s guarantee of the obligations incurred under the Mission Facility, the Marshall Facility and the Shield Facility, (3) Nexstar having power over significant activities affecting the VIEs\u2019 economic performance, including budgeting for advertising revenue, advertising sales and, for Mission, White Knight, Parker, Shield, Vaughan, Tamer and Super Towers, hiring and firing of sales force personnel and (4) purchase options granted by Mission, White Knight, Parker, Shield, Vaughn, Tamer and Super Towers which permit Nexstar to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each of the VIEs\u2019 stations, subject to FCC consent.\nIn compliance with FCC regulations, the VIEs maintain complete responsibility for and control over programming, finances and personnel for their respective stations. As a result, the VIEs\u2019 boards of directors and officers can make decisions with which we disagree and which could reduce the cash flow generated by these stations and, as a consequence, the amounts we receive under our local service agreements with the VIEs. For instance, the VIEs may decide to obtain and broadcast programming which, in our opinion, would prove unpopular and/or would generate less advertising revenue.\nThe recording of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in the future or the impact of tax law changes on such deferred tax assets could affect our operating results.\nThe Company currently has significant net deferred tax assets resulting from tax credit carryforwards, net operating losses and other deductible temporary differences that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods. Based on our assessment of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets, we determined that as of December 31, 2016, based on projected future income, approximately $59.7 million of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized in the future, and no valuation allowance is currently required for these deferred tax assets. Should we determine in the future that these assets will not be realized, the Company will be required to record a valuation allowance in connection with these deferred tax assets and the Company\u2019s operating results would be adversely affected in the period such determination is made. In addition, tax law changes could negatively impact the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to use net operating loss carry-forwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) to reduce future tax payments may be limited if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels or there is a change in ownership of Nexstar, Mission, Marshall or White Knight.\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company had NOLs of approximately $67.0 million for U.S. federal tax purposes and $77.2 million for state tax purposes. These NOLs expire at varying dates through 2035. To the extent available, we intend to use these NOLs to reduce the corporate income tax liability associated with our operations. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (\u201cSection 382\u201d) generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of NOLs that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in stock ownership. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders or public groups, which are generally outside of our control.\nThe ability to use NOLs is also dependent upon the Company\u2019s ability to generate taxable income. The NOLs could expire before the Company generates sufficient taxable income to use them. To the extent the Company\u2019s use of NOLs is significantly limited, the Company\u2019s income could be subject to corporate income tax earlier than it would if it were able to use NOLs, which could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s financial results and operations. Changes in ownership are largely beyond the Company\u2019s control and the Company can give no assurance that it will continue to have realizable NOLs.\nThe revenue generated by stations we operate or provide services to could decline substantially if they fail to maintain or renew their network affiliation agreements on favorable terms, or at all.\nDue to the quality of the programming provided by the networks, stations that are affiliated with a network generally have higher ratings than unaffiliated independent stations in the same market. As a result, it is important for stations to maintain their network affiliations. Most of the stations that we operate or provide services to have network affiliation agreements. As of December 31, 2016, 20 full power television stations have primary affiliation agreements with ABC, 19 with NBC, 26 with FOX, 23 with CBS, 10 with The CW and five with MyNetworkTV. Each of ABC, NBC and CBS generally provides affiliated stations with up to 22 hours of prime time programming per week, while each of FOX, MyNetworkTV and The CW provides affiliated stations with up to 15 hours of prime time programming per week. In return, affiliated stations broadcast the respective network\u2019s commercials during the network programming.\nAll of the network affiliation agreements of the stations that we own, operate, program or provide sales and other services to are scheduled to expire at various times through June 2020. In order to renew certain of our affiliation agreements we may be required to make cash payments to the network and to accept other material modifications of existing affiliation agreements. If any of our stations cease to maintain affiliation agreements with their networks for any reason, we would need to find alternative sources of programming, which may be less attractive to our audiences and more expensive to obtain. In addition, a loss of a specific network affiliation for a station may affect our retransmission consent payments resulting in us receiving less retransmission consent fees. Further, some of our network affiliation agreements are subject to earlier termination by the networks under specified circumstances.\nFor more information regarding these network affiliation agreements, see Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Network Affiliations.\u201d\nThe loss of or material reduction in retransmission consent revenues or further change in the current retransmission consent regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nNexstar\u2019s retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs permit the MVPDs to retransmit our stations\u2019 signals to their subscribers in exchange for the payment of compensation to us from the system operators as consideration. If we are unable to renegotiate these agreements on favorable terms, or at all, the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe television networks have taken the position that they, as the owners or licensees of certain of the programming we broadcast and provide for retransmission, are entitled to a portion of the compensation we receive under the retransmission consent agreements and are including provisions for these payments to them in their network affiliation agreements. In addition, our affiliation agreements with some broadcast networks include terms that affect our ability to grant MVPDs the right to retransmit network programming, and in some cases, we may lose the right to grant retransmission consent to such providers. Inclusion of these or similar provisions in our network affiliation agreements could materially reduce this revenue source to the Company and could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, MVPDs are actively seeking to change the regulations under which retransmission consent is negotiated before both the U.S. Congress and the FCC in order to increase their bargaining leverage with television stations. On March 3, 2011, the FCC initiated a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to reexamine its rules (1) governing the requirements for good faith negotiations between MVPDs and broadcasters, including implementing a prohibition on one station negotiating retransmission consent terms for another station under a local service agreement; (2) for providing advance notice to consumers in the event of dispute; and (3) to extend certain cable-only obligations to all MVPDs. The FCC also asked for comment on eliminating the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity protection rules, which may permit MVPDs to import out-of-market television stations during a retransmission consent dispute.\nOn March 31, 2014, the FCC amended its rules governing \u201cgood faith\u201d retransmission consent negotiations to provide that it is a per se violation of the statutory duty to negotiate in good faith for a television broadcast station that is ranked among the top-four stations in a market (as measured by audience share) to negotiate retransmission consent jointly with another top-four station in the same market if the stations are not commonly owned. Under this rule, top-four stations may not (1) delegate authority to negotiate or approve a retransmission consent agreement to another non-commonly owned top-four station located in the same DMA or to a third party that negotiates on behalf of another non-commonly owned top-four television station in the same DMA; or (2) facilitate or agree to facilitate coordinated negotiation of retransmission consent terms between themselves, including through the sharing of information.\nThis rule took effect on June 18, 2014. On December 5, 2014, the U.S. Congress extended the joint negotiation prohibition to all non-commonly owned television stations in a market. Retransmission consent agreements jointly negotiated prior to June 18, 2014 remain enforceable until the end of their current terms; however, contractual provisions between separately owned same-market stations to consult or jointly negotiate retransmission agreements are now void. Accordingly, the VIEs with which we have sharing agreements must separately negotiate their respective retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs. We cannot predict what effect, if any, this requirement for separate negotiations will have on the Company\u2019s revenues and expenses.\nConcurrently with its adoption of the prohibition on certain joint retransmission consent negotiations, the FCC also adopted a further notice of proposed rulemaking which seeks additional comment on the elimination or modification of the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. The FCC\u2019s prohibition on certain joint retransmission consent negotiations and its possible elimination or modification of the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity protection rules may affect the Company\u2019s ability to sustain its current level of retransmission consent revenues or grow such revenues in the future and could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company cannot predict the resolution of the FCC\u2019s network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity proposals, or the impact of these proposals or the FCC\u2019s new prohibition on certain joint negotiations, on its business.\nIn addition, in the STELA Reauthorization Act of 2014, which was adopted and signed into law in December 2014, the U.S. Congress directed the FCC to commence a rulemaking to \u201creview its totality of the circumstances test for good faith [retransmission consent] negotiations.\u201d The FCC commenced this proceeding in September 2015, and comments and reply comments were submitted in 2015 and 2016. We cannot predict the proceeding\u2019s outcome or its impact on our business. However, in July 2016 the then-Chairman of the FCC announced that the agency would not adopt additional rules in this proceeding, however, the proceeding remains open.\nIn June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court held that an OTTDs retransmissions of broadcast television signals without the consent of the broadcast station violate copyright holders\u2019 exclusive right to perform their works publicly as provided under the Copyright Act. In December 2014, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to interpret the term \u201cMVPD\u201d to encompass OTTDs that make available for purchase multiple streams of video programming distributed at a prescheduled time, and seeking comment on the effects of applying MVPD rules to such OTTDs. Comments and reply comments were filed in 2015. Although the FCC has not classified OTTDs and MVPDs to-date, several OTTDs are actively seeking to negotiate agreements for retransmission of local stations within their markets. However, if the FCC ultimately determines that an OTTD is not an MVPD, or declines to apply certain rules governing MVPDs to OTTDs, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe FCC could decide not to grant renewal of the FCC license of any of the stations we operate or provide services to which would require that station to cease operations.\nTelevision broadcast licenses are granted for a maximum term of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application to the FCC. The FCC is required to grant an application for license renewal if, during the preceding term, the station served the public interest, the licensee did not commit any serious violations of the Communications Act or the FCC\u2019s rules, and the licensee committed no other violations of the Communications Act or the FCC\u2019s rules which, taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse. A majority of renewal applications are routinely granted under this standard. If a licensee fails to meet this standard the FCC may still grant renewal on terms and conditions that it deems appropriate, including a monetary forfeiture or renewal for a term less than the normal eight-year period. However, in an extreme case, the FCC may deny a station\u2019s license renewal application, resulting in termination of the station\u2019s authority to broadcast. Under the Communications Act, the term of a broadcast license is automatically extended during the pendency of the FCC\u2019s processing of a timely renewal application.\nThe Company filed renewal applications for its stations in the most recent license renewal cycle, all but two of which have been granted for an additional eight-year term. The Company expects the FCC to grant these renewals in due course but cannot provide any assurances that the FCC will do so. The time period in which third parties are permitted to submit objections to these applications has expired; however, such parties may continue to submit informal objections until an application is granted.\nThe loss of the services of our chief executive officer could disrupt management of our business and impair the execution of our business strategies.\nWe believe that our success depends upon our ability to retain the services of Perry A. Sook, our founder and President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Sook has been instrumental in determining our strategic direction and focus. The loss of Mr. Sook\u2019s services could adversely affect our ability to manage effectively our overall operations and successfully execute current or future business strategies.\nThe Company\u2019s growth may be limited if it is unable to implement its acquisition strategy.\nThe Company has achieved much of its growth through acquisitions. The Company intends to continue its growth by selectively pursuing acquisitions of television stations. The television broadcast industry is undergoing consolidation, which may reduce the number of acquisition targets and increase the purchase price of future acquisitions. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors may have greater financial or management resources with which to pursue acquisition targets. Therefore, even if the Company is successful in identifying attractive acquisition targets, it may face considerable competition and its acquisition strategy may not be successful.\nFCC rules and policies may also make it more difficult for the Company to acquire additional television stations. Television station acquisitions are subject to the approval of the FCC and, potentially, other regulatory authorities. FCC rules limit the number of television stations a company may own and define the types of local service agreements that \u201ccount\u201d as ownership by the party providing the services. Those rules are subject to change; for instance, rules and processing policies that the FCC adopted in 2014 (but which it has since rescinded) with respect to local service agreements impacted certain of our and Mission\u2019s previously announced acquisitions. The need for FCC and other regulatory approvals could restrict the Company\u2019s ability to consummate future transactions if, for example, the FCC or other government agencies believe that a proposed transaction would result in excessive concentration or other public interest detriment in a market, even if the proposed combination may otherwise comply with FCC ownership limitations. Additionally, the acquisition of Media General has significantly increased the Company\u2019s national audience reach to a level that approaches national television ownership limits imposed by the Communications Act and FCC rules. This may restrict future television station acquisitions by the Company and may require the Company to divest current stations in connection with any acquisition in order to comply with national television ownership limits.\nGrowing the Company\u2019s business through acquisitions involves risks and if it is unable to manage effectively its growth, its operating results will suffer.\nDuring the three years ended December 31, 2016, the Company acquired 36 full power television stations. On January 17, 2017, we completed the Merger with Media General. Media General owned, operated, or serviced 79 full power television stations in 48 markets. Substantially concurrent with the Merger, we sold the assets of 12 full power television stations in 12 markets, five of which were previously owned by us and seven of which were previously owned by Media General. Following these transactions, we own, operate, program or provide sales and other services to 171 full power television stations in 100 markets. To manage effectively its growth and address the increased reporting requirements and administrative demands that will result from future acquisitions, the Company will need, among other things, to continue to develop its financial and management controls and management information systems. The Company will also need to continue to identify, attract and retain highly skilled finance and management personnel. Failure to do any of these tasks in an efficient and timely manner could seriously harm its business.\nThere are other risks associated with growing our business through acquisitions. For example, with any past or future acquisition, there is the possibility that:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to successfully reduce costs, increase advertising revenue or audience share or realize anticipated synergies and economies of scale with respect to any acquired station;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to generate adequate returns on our acquisitions or investments;\n\u2022\nwe may encounter and fail to address risks or other problems associated with or arising from our reliance on the representations and warranties and related indemnities, if any, provided to us by the sellers of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nan acquisition may increase our leverage and debt service requirements or may result in our assuming unexpected liabilities;\n\u2022\nour management may be reassigned from overseeing existing operations by the need to integrate the acquired business;\n\u2022\nwe may experience difficulties integrating operations and systems, as well as company policies and cultures, including the operations, systems, policies and cultures of Media General;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to retain and grow relationships with the acquired company\u2019s key customers;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to retain and assimilate employees of the acquired business; and\n\u2022\nproblems may arise in entering new markets in which we have little or no experience.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, particularly during the period immediately following any acquisition.\nFCC actions have restricted our ability to create duopolies under local service agreements, which may harm our existing operations and impair our acquisition strategy.\nIn a number of our markets, we have created duopolies by entering into what we refer to as local service agreements. While these agreements take varying forms, a typical local service agreement is an agreement between two separately owned television stations serving the same market, whereby the owner of one station provides operational assistance to the other station, subject to ultimate editorial and other controls being exercised by the latter station\u2019s owner. By operating or entering into local service agreements with same-market stations, we (and the other station) achieve significant operational efficiencies. We also broaden our audience reach and enhance our ability to capture more advertising spending in a given market.\nThe FCC is required to review its media ownership rules every four years and eliminate those rules it finds no longer serve the \u201cpublic interest, convenience and necessity.\u201d In August 2016, the FCC adopted the \u201c2016 Ownership Order\u201d concluding the agency\u2019s 2010 and 2014 quadrennial reviews. The 2016 Ownership Order (1) retains the existing local television ownership rule and radio/television cross-ownership rule (with minor technical modifications to address the transition to digital television broadcasting), (2) extends the current ban on common ownership of two top-four television stations in a market to network affiliation swaps, (3) retains the existing ban on newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership in local markets while considering waivers and providing an exception for failed or failing entities, (4) retains the existing dual network rule, (5) making JSA relationships attributable interests, and (6) defines a category of sharing agreements designated as SSAs between stations and requires public disclosure of those SSAs (while not considering them attributable). The FCC\u2019s 2016 Ownership Order is subject to pending petitions for reconsideration and court appeals. We have sought FCC reconsideration of the order.\nIn August 2016, the FCC completed its most recent quadrennial media ownership review and adopted a rule that attributes another in-market station toward the local television ownership limits when one station owner sells more than 15% of the second station\u2019s weekly advertising inventory under a joint sales agreement (this rule had been previously adopted, but was vacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit). Parties to JSAs entered into prior to March 31, 2014 may continue to operate under these JSAs until September 30, 2025. We have sought FCC reconsideration the JSA attribution rule.\nOn February 3, 2017, the FCC terminated in full its guidance (issued on March 12, 2014) requiring careful scrutiny of broadcast television applications which propose sharing arrangements and contingent interests. Accordingly, the FCC will no longer evaluate whether options, loan guarantees and similar otherwise non-attributable interests create undue financial influence in transactions which also include sharing arrangements between a station licensee and another party.\nWe cannot predict what additional rules the FCC will adopt or when they will be adopted. In addition, uncertainty about media ownership regulations and adverse economic conditions have dampened the acquisition market from time to time, and changes in the regulatory approval process may make materially more expensive, or may materially delay, the Company\u2019s ability to close upon currently pending acquisitions or consummate further acquisitions in the future.\nThe FCC may decide to terminate \u201cgrandfathered\u201d time brokerage agreements.\nThe FCC attributes TBAs and local marketing agreements to the programmer under its ownership limits if the programmer provides more than 15% of a station\u2019s weekly broadcast programming. However, TBAs entered into prior to November 5, 1996 are exempt from attribution for now.\nThe FCC may review these \u201cgrandfathered\u201d TBAs in the future. During this review, the FCC may determine to terminate the \u201cgrandfathered\u201d period and make all TBAs fully attributable to the programmer. If the FCC does so, we will be required to terminate or modify our grandfathered TBAs unless the FCC simultaneously changes its duopoly rules to allow ownership of two stations in the applicable markets.\nWe are subject to foreign ownership limitations which limits foreign investments in us.\nThe Communications Act limits the extent of non-U.S. ownership of companies that own U.S. broadcast stations. Under this restriction, the holder of a U.S. broadcast license may have no more than 20% non-U.S. ownership (by vote and by equity). The Communications Act prohibits more than 25% indirect foreign ownership or control of a licensee through a parent company unless the FCC determines the public interest will be served by waiver of such restriction. The FCC has interpreted this provision to require an affirmative public interest showing before indirect foreign ownership of a broadcast licensee may exceed 25%. Therefore, certain investors may be prevented from investing in us if our foreign ownership is at or near the FCC limits.\nThe FCC\u2019s multiple ownership rules may limit our ability to acquire television stations in particular markets, restricting our ability to execute our acquisition strategy.\nThe number of television stations we may acquire in any local market or nationwide is limited by FCC rules and may vary depending upon whether the interests in other television stations or other media properties of persons affiliated with us are attributable under FCC rules. The broadcast and certain other media interests of our officers, directors and most stockholders with 5% or greater voting power are attributable under the FCC\u2019s rules, which may limit us from acquiring or owning television stations in particular markets while those officers, directors or stockholders are associated with us. In addition, the holder of otherwise non-attributable equity and/or debt in a licensee in excess of 33% of the total debt and equity of the licensee will be attributable where the holder is either a major program supplier to that licensee or the holder has an attributable interest in another broadcast station or daily newspaper in the same market.\nTwo of Nexstar\u2019s directors also currently serve on the board of directors of Radio One, Inc., which owns and operates approximately 55 radio stations in 16 markets. The FCC considers the radio stations owned by Radio One, Inc. as attributable to Nexstar, due to this common director relationship. Therefore, depending on the number of stations owned by Radio One, Inc. in a given market, we may not be able to purchase a television station in that market.\nThe Company has a material amount of goodwill and intangible assets, and therefore the Company could suffer additional losses due to future asset impairment charges.\nAs of December 31, 2016, $1.3 billion, or 45.2%, of the Company\u2019s combined total assets consisted of goodwill and intangible assets, including FCC licenses and network affiliation agreements. The Company tests goodwill and FCC licenses annually, and on an interim date if factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test of these assets, in accordance with accounting and disclosure requirements for goodwill and other intangible assets. The Company tests network affiliation agreements whenever circumstances or indicators become apparent the asset may not be recoverable through expected future cash flows. The methods used to evaluate the impairment of the Company\u2019s goodwill and intangible assets would be affected by a significant reduction in operating results or cash flows at one or more of the Company\u2019s television stations, or a forecast of such reductions, a significant adverse change in the advertising marketplaces in which the Company\u2019s television stations operate, the loss of network affiliations, or by adverse changes to FCC ownership rules, among others, which may be beyond the Company\u2019s control. If the carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets is revised downward due to impairment, such non-cash charge could materially affect the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurances concerning continuing dividend payments and any decrease or suspension of the dividend could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur common stockholders are only entitled to receive the dividends declared by our board of directors. Our board of directors has declared in 2016 a total cash dividend with respect to the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock of $0.96 per share in equal quarterly installments of $0.24 per share. We expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends at the rate set forth in our current dividend policy. However, future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and can be changed or discontinued at any time. Dividend determinations (including the amount of the cash dividend, the record date and date of payment) will depend upon, among other things, our future operations and earnings, targeted future acquisitions, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, the senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our existing notes limit our ability to pay dividends. Given these considerations, our board of directors may increase or decrease the amount of the dividend at any time and may also decide to suspend or discontinue the payment of cash dividends in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur operating results are dependent on advertising revenue and as a result, we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and other factors beyond our control than businesses not dependent on advertising.\nWe derive a majority of our revenue from the sale of advertising time on our stations and community portal websites. Our ability to sell advertising time depends on numerous factors that may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe health of the economy in the local markets where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole;\n\u2022\nthe popularity of our station and website programming;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in pricing for local and national advertising;\n\u2022\nthe activities of our competitors, including increased competition from other forms of advertising-based media, particularly newspapers, cable television, Internet and radio;\n\u2022\nthe decreased demand for political advertising in non-election years; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the makeup of the population in the areas where our stations are located.\nBecause businesses generally reduce their advertising budgets during economic recessions or downturns, the reliance upon advertising revenue makes our operating results susceptible to prevailing economic conditions. In addition, our programming may not attract sufficient targeted viewership, and we may not achieve favorable ratings. Our ratings depend partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control, such as viewer preferences, competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities. A shift in viewer preferences could cause our programming not to gain popularity or to decline in popularity, which could cause our advertising revenue to decline. Further, we and the programming providers upon which we rely may not be able to anticipate, and effectively react to, shifts in viewer tastes and interests in our markets.\nBecause a high percentage of our operating expense is fixed, a relatively small decrease in advertising revenue could have a significant negative impact on our financial results.\nOur business is characterized generally by high fixed costs, primarily for debt service, broadcast rights and personnel. Other than commissions paid to our sales staff and outside sales agencies, our expenses do not vary significantly with the increase or decrease in advertising revenue. As a result, a relatively small change in advertising prices could have a disproportionate effect on our financial results. Accordingly, a minor shortfall in expected revenue could have a significant negative impact on our financial results.\nPreemption of regularly scheduled programming by news coverage may affect our revenue and results of operations.\nThe Company may experience a loss of advertising revenue and incur additional broadcasting expenses due to preemption of our regularly scheduled programming by network coverage of a major global news event such as a war or terrorist attack or by local coverage of local disasters, such as tornados and hurricanes. As a result, advertising may not be aired and the revenue for such advertising may be lost unless the station is able to run the advertising at agreed-upon times in the future. Advertisers may not agree to run such advertising in future time periods, and space may not be available for such advertising. The duration of any preemption of programming cannot be predicted if it occurs. In addition, our stations and the stations we provide services to may incur additional expenses as a result of expanded news coverage of a war or terrorist attack or local disaster. The loss of revenue and increased expenses could negatively affect our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to respond to changes in technology and evolving industry trends, our television businesses may not be able to compete effectively.\nNew technologies may adversely affect our television stations. Information delivery and programming alternatives such as cable, direct satellite-to-home services, pay-per-view, video on demand, over-the-top distribution of programming, the Internet, telephone company services, mobile devices, digital video recorders and home video and entertainment systems have fractionalized television viewing audiences and expanded the numbers and types of distribution channels for advertisers to access. Over the past decade, cable television programming services, other emerging video distribution platforms and the Internet have captured an increasing market share, while the aggregate viewership of the major television networks has declined. In addition, the expansion of cable and satellite television, digital delivery and other technological changes has increased, and may continue to increase, the competitive demand for programming. Such increased demand, together with rising production costs, may increase our programming costs or impair our ability to acquire or develop desired programming.\nIn addition, video compression techniques now in use are expected to permit greater numbers of channels to be carried within existing bandwidth. These compression techniques and other technological developments are applicable to all video delivery systems, including over-the-air broadcasting, and have the potential to provide vastly expanded programming to targeted audiences. Reduction in the cost of creating additional channel capacity could lower entry barriers for new channels and encourage the development of increasingly specialized niche programming, resulting in more audience fractionalization. This ability to reach very narrowly defined audiences may alter the competitive dynamics for advertising expenditures. We are unable to predict the effect that these and other technological changes will have on the television industry or our results of operations.\nThe FCC can sanction us for programming broadcast on our stations which it finds to be indecent.\nThe FCC may impose substantial fines, to a maximum of $325,000 per violation, on television broadcasters for the broadcast of indecent material in violation of the Communications Act and its rules. Because the Company\u2019s programming is in large part comprised of programming provided by the networks with which the stations are affiliated, the Company does not have full control over what is broadcast on its stations and may be subject to the imposition of fines if the FCC finds such programming to be indecent.\nIn June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court decided a challenge to the FCC\u2019s indecency enforcement without resolving the constitutionality of such enforcement, and the FCC thereafter requested public comment on the appropriate substance and scope of its indecency enforcement policy. The FCC has issued very few further decisions or rules in this area, and the courts may in the future have further occasion to review the FCC\u2019s current policy or any modifications thereto. The outcomes of these proceedings could affect future FCC policies in this area, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIntense competition in the television industry could limit our growth and profitability.\nAs a television broadcasting company, we face a significant level of competition, both directly and indirectly. Generally we compete for our audience against all the other leisure activities in which one could choose to engage rather than watch television. Specifically, stations we own or provide services to compete for audience share, programming and advertising revenue with other television stations in their respective markets and with other advertising media, including newspapers, radio stations, cable television, DBS systems, mobile services, video streaming services and the Internet.\nThe entertainment and television industries are highly competitive and are undergoing a period of consolidation. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial, marketing, programming and broadcasting resources than we do. The markets in which we operate are also in a constant state of change arising from, among other things, technological improvements and economic and regulatory developments. Technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of television entertainment, such as cable television, wireless cable, satellite-to-home distribution services, pay-per-view, home video and entertainment systems and Internet and mobile distribution of video programming have fractionalized television viewing audiences and have subjected free over-the-air television broadcast stations to increased competition. We may not be able to compete effectively or adjust our business plans to meet changing market conditions. We are unable to predict what forms of competition will develop in the future, the extent of the competition or its possible effects on our business.\nThe FCC could implement regulations or the U.S. Congress could adopt legislation that might have a significant impact on the operations of the stations we own and the stations we provide services to or the television broadcasting industry as a whole.\nThe FCC has open proceedings to determine whether to standardize TV stations\u2019 reporting of programming responsive to local needs and interests; whether to modify its network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules; whether to modify its standards for \u201cgood faith\u201d retransmission consent negotiations; and whether to broaden the definition of \u201cMVPD\u201d to include \u201cover-the-top\u201d video programming distributors. Additionally, FCC proceedings to examine shared services agreements between television stations and to determine whether to modify or eliminate certain of its broadcast ownership rules are the subject of pending petitions for reconsideration and court appeals.\nThe FCC also has sought comment on whether there are alternatives to the use of DMAs to define local markets such that certain viewers whose current DMAs straddle multiple states would be provided with more in-state broadcast programming. If the FCC determines to modify the use of existing DMAs to determine a station\u2019s local market, such change might materially alter current station operations and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe FCC also may decide to initiate other new rule making proceedings on its own or in response to requests from outside parties, any of which might have such an impact. The U.S. Congress may also act to amend the Communications Act in a manner that could impact our stations and the stations we provide services to or the television broadcast industry in general.\nThe FCC is reallocating a portion of the spectrum available for use by television broadcasters to wireless broadband use, which could substantially impact our future operations and may reduce viewer access to our programming.\nThe FCC is in the process of repurposing a portion of the television broadcast spectrum for wireless broadband use. Pursuant to federal legislation enacted in 2012, the FCC is administering an incentive auction whereby it is seeking to make additional spectrum available to meet future wireless broadband needs. Under the auction statute and rules, television broadcasters may voluntarily relinquish all or part of their spectrum in exchange for consideration, and wireless broadband providers and other entities may bid to acquire the relinquished television spectrum. After the auction\u2019s conclusion, television stations that have not relinquished their spectrum will be \u201crepacked\u201d into the frequency band still remaining for television broadcast use.\nThe incentive auction commenced on March 29, 2016. The \u201creverse\u201d portion of the auction (by which television broadcasters accepted bids to relinquish their spectrum) and the \u201cforward\u201d portion of the auction (by which wireless providers and other entities bid to acquire the relinquished spectrum) have both concluded. The final portion of the auction is scheduled to occur in March 2017, and we expect the FCC to formally close the auction in April 2017.\nCertain of our stations have accepted bids to relinquish their spectrum and will either discontinue operation or share a channel with another broadcaster. These stations will be required to cease broadcasting on their current channels (and, if applicable, implement channel sharing arrangements) between three and twelve months after receiving payment for the relinquishment of their channels (which we expect to occur later in 2017).\nThe majority of our television stations did not accept bids to relinquish their television channels. Of those stations, many will be assigned new channels in the reduced post-auction television band. These \u201crepacked\u201d stations will be required to construct and license the necessary technical modifications to operate on their new assigned channels, and will need to cease operating on their existing channels, by deadlines which the FCC will establish and which will be no more than thirty-nine months after the official close of the auction. Congress has allocated up to $1.75 billion to reimburse television broadcasters and MVPDs for costs reasonably incurred due to the repack.\nThe reallocation of television spectrum to broadband use may be to the detriment of our investment in digital facilities, could require substantial additional investment to continue our current operations, and may require viewers to invest in additional equipment or subscription services to continue receiving broadcast television signals. We cannot predict the impact of the incentive auction and subsequent repacking on our business.\nWe have made investments in digital media businesses.\nWe have invested in various digital media businesses as well as digital offerings for each of our broadcast stations. Due to the intense competition, limited operating history and rapidly evolving nature of these digital media businesses, the actual future operating results could be volatile and negatively impact the year-to-year trends of our operations.\nCybersecurity risks could affect the Company\u2019s operating effectiveness.\nThe Company uses computers in substantially all aspects of its business operations. Its revenues are increasingly dependent on digital products. Such use exposes the Company to potential cyber incidents resulting from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. The results of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, business interruption, disclosure of nonpublic information, decreased advertising revenues, misstated financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation and reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence.", "PERMNO": 89916, "SIC": 4833, "TIC": "NXST"}
