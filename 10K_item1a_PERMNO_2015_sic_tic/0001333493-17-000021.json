RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business as they may have a significant impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance should not be considered as a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nChanges and developments in the health insurance industry or in the health insurance system in the United States as a result of health care reform could harm our business.\nOur business depends upon the private sector of the United States health insurance system, its relative role in financing health care delivery and health insurance carriers\u2019 use of, and payment of commissions to, agents and brokers to market health insurance plans. In March 2010, the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and related amendments in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act were signed into law. These health care reform laws contain provisions that have and will continue to change the industry in which we operate in substantial ways. Among several other provisions, health care reform includes a mandate requiring individuals to maintain health insurance or face tax penalties; a mandate that certain employers offer their employees group health insurance coverage or face tax penalties; requirements relating to employer contribution to employee health coverage; prohibitions against insurance companies using pre-existing health conditions as a reason to deny an application for health insurance; prohibitions on rescission of health insurance; prohibitions on lifetime coverage limits; requirements for guaranteed renewability of health insurance plans; health insurance premium setting guidelines; limitations on deductibles and cost-sharing; medical loss ratio requirements that require each health insurance carrier to spend a certain percentage of their premium revenue on reimbursement for clinical services and activities that improve health care quality and, if they do not, to provide rebates to policyholders; minimum benefit levels for health insurance plans, including actuarial value standards and limitations on annual coverage limits; taxes and assessments on health insurance carriers; establishment of state and/or federal health insurance exchanges to facilitate access to, and the purchase of, health insurance; open enrollment periods for the purchase of individual and family health insurance; assistance for member run health insurance issuers; creation of multi-state health insurance plans to be offered on the exchanges and with oversight from the Office of Personnel Management; requirements for uniform disclosure relating to the costs and benefits of health insurance; government subsidized high risk pools; an expansion of Medicaid so that more individuals will be insured under state Medicaid programs; and subsidies and cost-sharing credits to make health insurance more affordable for those below certain income levels. The implementation of health care reform has increased and could further increase our competition and could reduce or eliminate the need for health insurance agents or demand for the health insurance for individuals, families or small businesses that we sell; decrease the number of health insurance plans that we sell as well as the number of health\ninsurance carriers offering them; cause a substantial reduction in our membership and revenue; cause us to incur increased expense across our business and cause health insurance carriers to reduce our commissions and other amounts they pay for our services or change our relationship with them in other ways, any of which could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, various aspects of health care reform have caused and could continue to cause health insurance carriers to determine to limit the type of health insurance plans we sell and the geographies in which we sell them, to reduce or eliminate the commissions we receive from them as a result of our sale of health insurance plans, to exit the business of selling individual and family health insurance plans in particular jurisdictions or altogether, to eliminate certain categories of products or attempt to move members into new plans for which we receive lower or no commissions, any of which could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, health insurance carriers offering coverage in the individual or small business health insurance market must ensure that such coverage meets certain actuarial value standards, includes certain minimum health benefits and is not subject to lifetime or, for most health insurance benefits, annual dollar amount coverage limits. Moreover, health insurance carriers cannot deny individuals health insurance for health reasons. Individuals also are required to hold plans providing minimum essential coverage to meet the mandate for health insurance and avoid a tax penalty. The cost of health insurance has generally increased and several health insurance carriers have indicated that they are suffering financial losses in their individual and family health insurance business. As a result, major health insurance carriers and other health insurance carriers for which we have sold individual and family health insurance have exited the individual and family health insurance business altogether or in a large number of states. Some of these carriers have indicated that they only plan to sell individual and family health insurance through government exchanges. As a result, the number of individual and family health insurance plans offered on our website has been reduced, including many states and zip codes where we have no individual and family health insurance plans to offer. If these conditions persist, we anticipate that they will continue to decrease demand for the individual and family health insurance that we sell and harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, a significant number of our members have purchased their individual and family health insurance from carriers exiting the individual and family health insurance market. These members have or will lose their health insurance plans and will need to shop for and purchase individual and family health insurance from another health insurance carrier if they desire to maintain individual and family health insurance. These circumstances could result in decreased retention rates in our membership, a reduction in our commission revenue and otherwise harm our business, operating results and financial condition. If additional health insurance carriers determine not to sell qualified health plans or exit the business of selling individual and family health insurance in certain states or altogether, the impact on our individual and family membership and commission revenue will likely be more pronounced. In addition, we anticipate that premiums for individual and family health insurance will generally increase under the Affordable Care Act as it currently exists, perhaps substantially. If the cost of health insurance increases, we could experience a reduction in demand for the individual and family health insurance that we sell, which could cause us to suffer a substantial reduction in our membership, and materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Moreover, compared to the increased cost of individual and family health insurance plans, government subsidies to purchase health insurance and the health care reform tax penalty may not be sufficient enough to drive a substantial number of new entrants into the individual and family health insurance market or incentivize our existing members to maintain their individual and family health insurance plans, which could contribute to a decline in our membership and materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe 2016 Presidential and Congressional elections resulted in the election of Donald Trump as President and a Republican-controlled Congress. These election results have the potential to lead to significant changes to the Affordable Care Act and the regulatory environment impacting the market for individual and family health insurance products. The new administration and Republican leadership have repeatedly communicated their intention to alter or repeal the Affordable Care Act. Committees in the House of Representatives have released draft bills amending the Affordable Care Act. Given the preliminary nature of the draft legislation in the House of Representatives and that any proposed legislation must be approved by the full House of Representatives and the United States Senate and signed into law by the President, it is difficult to predict the impact of changes to the Affordable Care Act on our business and the overall market for health insurance. While actions to repeal or modify the Affordable Care Act could be beneficial to our business, they may also harm our business and our ability to sell health insurance and result in a decrease in demand for the health insurance we sell, any of which could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the President and the executive branch of the Federal government have a significant impact on the implementation of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act through the adoption of regulations, and President Trump\u2019s administration could make changes impacting the implementation of the Affordable Care Act that harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we do not retain our existing members and enroll a large number of individuals and families into health insurance plans during the enrollment periods, our business will be harmed.\nMedicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans are required to be purchased during an annual enrollment period, subject to certain exceptions. As a result of health care reform, individual and family health insurance is required to be purchased during an open enrollment period. Our revenue depends in large part on the number of paying individual and family and Medicare-related health insurance members we are successful in retaining and on those we acquire during the enrollment periods. We may not be successful in retaining or acquiring members for a number of reasons. If we are unsuccessful, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed. For example, we have experienced a decrease in our individual and family membership retention rates since the implementation of health care reform. We also experienced significantly lower individual and family health insurance application volumes during the last two open enrollment periods. These circumstances have resulted in lower individual and family health insurance plan membership. Open enrollment periods of limited duration in the individual and family health insurance markets have resulted, and may in the future result in a reduction in our membership and revenue; an increase in our expenses, particularly during the open enrollment periods; and otherwise may harm our business, operating results and financial condition, particularly given that the open enrollment period for individual and family health insurance overlaps with the annual enrollment period for the Medicare plans that we sell.\nIt may be difficult for the health insurance agents we employ and our systems and processes to handle as a business the increased volume of health insurance transactions that occur in a short period of time during the health care annual open enrollment period and/or the Medicare annual enrollment period. We hire a significant number of additional employees on a temporary or seasonal basis in a limited period of time to address the expected increase in the volume of health insurance transactions during the Medicare annual enrollment period. We must ensure that these employees are timely licensed, trained and certified and have the appropriate authority to sell health insurance in a number of states. We depend upon state departments of insurance, government exchanges and health insurance carriers for the licensing, certification and appointment of our health insurance agent employees. If our ability to market and sell individual and family health insurance or Medicare-related health insurance is constrained during an enrollment period for any reason, such as technology failures, reduced allocation of resources, any inability to timely license, train, certify and authorize our employees to sell health insurance, interruptions in the operation of our website or systems, or issues with government-run health insurance exchanges, we could suffer a reduction in our membership and our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. CMS recently proposed reducing the length of the open enrollment period for individual and family health insurance so that it runs from November 1 to December 15 for coverage to be effective in 2018. If this proposed rule becomes final, it could amplify the risks we face as a result of open enrollment periods. In addition, reduction in the amount of time we have to enroll individuals and families during the open enrollment period could result in a reduction in our membership and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf investments we make in enrollment periods do not result in a significant number of paying members, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nIn an attempt to attract and enroll a large number of individuals during the Medicare annual enrollment period and the health care reform open enrollment period, we may invest in areas of our business, including technology and content, customer care and enrollment, and marketing and advertising. We have in the past made investments in areas of our business in advance of enrollment periods that have not resulted in the results we expected when making those investments. Any investment we make in either the Medicare annual enrollment period or the health care reform open enrollment period may not result in a significant number of paying members. If it does not, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nOur business may be harmed if we do not enroll subsidy-eligible individuals through government-run health insurance exchanges.\nIn order to offer the qualified health plans that individuals and families must purchase to receive Affordable Care Act subsidies, agents and brokers must meet certain conditions, such as receiving permission to do so from the health insurance exchange, entering into an agreement with the health insurance exchange, ensuring that the enrollment and subsidy application is completed through the state\u2019s health insurance exchange (or the FFM in states that did not establish their own exchange) and complying with privacy, security and other standards, some of which have been recently issued and contain requirements that are new to us. In the event Internet-based agents and brokers such as us use the Internet for completion of qualified health plan selection purposes, their websites are required to meet certain additional conditions, such as compliance with standards for display of health plan and related information; providing consumers the ability to view all health plans offered on the government-run exchange; displaying certain health plan and other data available on the exchange; and providing a mechanism for consumers to withdraw from the application process on the agent or broker\u2019s website. A large segment of the population is eligible for subsidies in connection with the purchase of health insurance, and a substantial number of our existing members are\neligible for subsidies. To the extent we enroll individuals and families into qualified health plans, we do so through our relationship with the FFM and have not focused on enrolling individuals into qualified health plans through exchanges in states operating their own health insurance exchanges. As a result, we may lose existing members who reside in states not supported by FFM and may not gain new subsidy-eligible members in those states, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. We also may experience difficulty in satisfying the conditions and requirements to offer qualified health plans to our existing members and new potential members and in enrolling them through the FFM. If we are not able to satisfy these conditions and requirements, or if we are not able to successfully adopt and maintain solutions that allow us to enroll large numbers of individuals and families in qualified plans over the Internet both during and outside of open enrollment periods, we will lose existing members and new members, and may incur additional expense, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn order to sell qualified health plans to subsidy eligible individuals during the open enrollment period, we must establish and maintain relationships with government-run health insurance exchanges, particularly the FFM, and given that at least a part of the qualified health insurance plan enrollment process must occur through the health insurance exchanges, we must maintain our technology platform to be able to enroll consumers in qualified health plans through the FFM in a scalable manner. If we are not able to adopt and maintain solutions to integrate with government-run health insurance exchanges or if the health insurance exchange websites and other processes are not consumer friendly, efficient and compatible with the process we have developed for enrolling individuals and families into qualified health plans through the exchanges, we would not be successful in retaining and acquiring members, and our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, has broad authority over the requirements that we must meet in order to enroll individuals into qualified health plans through the FFM, and in addition to issuing new requirements, has the authority to interpret existing requirements. CMS directed us to alter our method of enrolling subsidy eligible individuals into qualified health insurance plans beginning in February 2016. The change required us to cease using the online process we developed for enrolling individuals into qualified health plans through the FFM and use a prescribed FFM process. As a result of the changes that we had to make to our online process in response to CMS requirements and that required that our customers visit the FFM website in the middle of the process to receive a subsidy eligibility determination, we experienced a reduction in the rate at which individuals and families starting the application process for qualified health plans and subsidies became members and a reduction in our membership. If these conditions persist, we could continue to experience loss of existing members and new potential members, and a reduction in our individual and family health insurance plan membership and commission revenue, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. While we intend to continue to offer consumers the ability to purchase qualified health plans through the FFM on our ecommerce platform, we have reduced our individual and family health insurance plan marketing expenses, which has resulted and could in the future result in a reduction in our individual and family and ancillary health insurance product membership and harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, to the extent that we do enroll individuals into qualified health plans through the FFM, the FFM website, systems and infrastructure must be operational and not suffer significant outages or technical problems as a result of the number of individuals attempting to enroll in qualified health plans or for other reasons. If the FFM experiences these problems, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nWe have entered into agreements with CMS relating to our ability to enroll individuals in qualified health plans through the FFM. The agreements contain comprehensive privacy and security and other requirements. In order to be able to enroll individuals into qualified health plans, we also must satisfy several other regulatory requirements and comply with additional laws and regulations. In order to enroll individuals into qualified health plans online through the FFM, we must among other things, maintain our agreements with the FFM which need to be renewed every year; satisfy the requirements contained in the relevant agreements as well as applicable laws and regulations; maintain a compliant Internet platform incorporating those requirements; maintain qualified health plan information from health insurance carriers and CMS and incorporate it into our web platform; maintain a privacy and security program to conform to the privacy and security requirements of our agreement with CMS as well as applicable laws and regulations; and adopt and maintain solutions to integrate with the FFM so that information may be passed to and from us relating to enrollment in qualified health plans and subsidy eligibility. If we do not comply with applicable laws, regulations and requirements, our ability to enroll individuals into qualified health plans through the FFM could be terminated and we may be required to pay significant monetary penalties, which would harm our business operating results and financial condition.\nThe laws, regulations and requirements applicable to enrolling individuals in qualified health plans through government-run health insurance exchanges are evolving. For example, we were required to translate significant portions of our website into Spanish for the recently closed open enrollment period in order to be able to offer qualified health plans to individuals in FFM states where greater than 10% of the state\u2019s population is Spanish speaking (currently Texas). If it is determined that the manner in which we translated our website, or the extent to which our website has been translated, is insufficient, we may not be allowed to offer qualified health plans in those states. Our ability to maintain compliance with the various requirements to enroll individuals through the FFM has presented, and could in the future present, significant\nchallenges for us. If we are not successful in maintaining compliance, we will not be successful in enrolling individuals and families into qualified health plans, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe FFM may at any time cease allowing us to enroll individuals in qualified health plans or change the requirements for doing so and must allocate resources to ensuring, and otherwise ensure, that its technology platform functions properly to enroll individuals online with an adequate customer experience and that results in our receiving credit for enrollments so that we may be paid a commission. We also depend on the FFM to maintain and permit us to use certain access points to the FFM in order for us to be able to assist individuals in applying for subsidies and enrolling in qualified health plans online. If the FFM does not maintain or permit us to use these access points, if CMS requests further changes to our online process for enrolling individuals into qualified health plans, or if our technology and website or the FFM\u2019s technology or website do not function or work together properly to allow us to assist with subsidy applications and enroll large numbers of individuals into qualified health plans in a short period of time, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed. In addition, instability or changes to either the FFM website, particularly the portions used by consumers who are referred by agents and brokers, or other FFM operations relating to agent and broker assisted enrollment in qualified health plans, could negatively impact our ability to retain existing members and add new members and would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe depend upon health insurance carriers and government-run health insurance exchanges to adopt and maintain systems and processes that can handle sales of individual and family health insurance outside of the open enrollment period to those who qualify for special enrollment periods, which may include systems and processes that verify whether individuals and families are permitted to purchase individual and family health insurance outside of the open enrollment period. If these systems and processes are not developed, are not maintained or are not compatible with our platform and processes for selling individual and family health insurance, our ability to sell individual and family health insurance outside of the open enrollment period will be negatively impacted, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we do not successfully compete with government-run health insurance exchanges, our business may be harmed.\nWe compete with government-run health insurance exchanges, among others. The exchanges may elect whether or not we are able to enroll subsidy-eligible individuals in qualified health plans through them and determine the manner in which we may do so. The exchanges have websites where individuals and small businesses can shop for and purchase health insurance, and they also have offline customer support and enrollment capabilities. Individuals who are eligible for government subsidies in the form of premium tax credits and cost sharing reductions must apply for their subsidy and purchase qualified health plans through a government exchange to receive their subsidy. In the aggregate, government exchanges have greater resources, larger marketing budgets and greater public outreach capability than we do. They have and may in the future impact the process we use to enroll individuals and families through them in a manner that results in a reduction of the individuals and families that we are able to cost-effectively enroll through exchanges. In addition, individuals that utilize our platform and services to apply for subsidies and health insurance through government exchanges receive marketing and communications from the government exchanges after they do so. In the event our existing members purchase health insurance directly through health insurance exchanges without using us as their health insurance agent, as a result of their being eligible for a subsidy or otherwise, we will no longer receive commission revenue as a result of our sale of health insurance to them. Under regulations adopted as a part of health care reform, government-run health insurance exchanges are required to automatically re-enroll individuals and families into a qualified health insurance plan purchased through the exchange if the individuals or families do not take affirmative action, which may contribute to a reduction in our membership. Competitive pressure from government-run health insurance exchanges has resulted, and may in the future result, in our experiencing increased marketing costs, decreased traffic to our website, a reduction in our individual and family health insurance membership and revenue and may otherwise harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur revenue will be adversely impacted if commission rates decline or if consumers choose health insurance products for which we receive lower or no commissions.\nOur revenue will be adversely impacted if our commission rates decline. The commission rates we receive are impacted by a variety of factors, including the particular health insurance plans chosen by our members, the carriers offering those plans, our members\u2019 states of residence, the laws and regulations in those jurisdictions, the average premiums of plans purchased through us and health care reform. Our commission revenue per member has in the past decreased, and could in the future decrease, as a result of either reductions in contractual commission rates, unfavorable changes in health insurance carrier override commission programs, or the mix of carriers whose products we sell during a given period, all of which are beyond our control and may occur on short notice. To the extent these and other factors cause our commission revenue per member to decline, our revenue may decline and our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nOur revenue will be adversely impacted if consumers enroll in Medicare or individual and family health insurance plans that reduce our average commission revenue per member. Due in part to health care reform, major health insurance carriers and other health insurance carriers have exited the individual and family health insurance market in certain jurisdictions or altogether or reduced individual and family health insurance selling efforts in a large number of states, leading to reduction in our commission rates and changes in the health insurance carrier composition of our commission revenue. Since our commission rates vary by carrier, a shift in the mix of products selected by our new members will have an impact on our average commission revenue per member. We do not plan to offer carriers\u2019 individual and family health insurance products for sale on our website if we do not receive commissions for the sale of those plans. Given the significant losses that carriers have sustained in connection with their sale of individual and family health insurance, many health insurance carriers with which we have a relationship, including large national health insurance carriers, have reduced or eliminated commissions for individual and family health insurance, including for enrollments during the last open enrollment period for 2017 coverage and in a limited number of cases our renewal commissions for individual and family health insurance plans we sold in prior years. If these conditions persist or additional carriers reduce or eliminate commissions, our business operating results and financial conditions would be harmed.\nOur business may be harmed if we lose our relationship with health insurance carriers or our relationship with health insurance carriers is modified.\nWe typically enter into contractual agency relationships with health insurance carriers that are non-exclusive and terminable on short notice by either party for any reason. In many cases, health insurance carriers also may amend the terms of our agreements unilaterally on short notice. Carriers may be unwilling to allow us to sell their existing or new health insurance plans, or desire to amend our agreements with them, for a variety of reasons, including for competitive or regulatory reasons, dissatisfaction with the economics of the members that we place with them or because they do not want to be associated with our brand. We may also terminate our relationship with health insurance carriers. In addition, many aspects of health care reform have caused, and may in the future cause, carriers to modify their relationship with us given the substantial changes in the industry in which we operate. Carriers may choose to exclude us from their most profitable or popular plans or may determine not to distribute health insurance plans in the Medicare, individual and family and small business markets in certain geographies or altogether. In the event we are not successful in gaining or maintaining the ability to sell Medicare, individual and family and qualified health insurance plans, if health insurance carriers pay us no commissions or reduced commissions in connection with the sale of these plans or if health insurance carriers change our relationship with them in other ways, we could lose a substantial number of existing and potential members and commission revenue, which would materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition. The termination of our relationship with a health insurance carrier by us or the health insurance carrier or the amendment of or change in our relationship with a carrier could reduce the variety of health insurance plans we offer, cause a loss of commission revenue or have other adverse impacts, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. It also could adversely impact, or cause the termination of, commissions for past and future sales, which would materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Our business could also be harmed if in the future we fail to develop new carrier relationships and are unable to offer consumers a variety of health insurance plans in each jurisdiction.\nGiven the significant losses that carriers have sustained in connection with their sale of individual and family health insurance as a result of health care reform, many health insurance carriers with which we have a relationship, including large national health insurance carriers, reduced or eliminated our commissions for selling individual and family health insurance, including individual and family health insurance we sold during the last open enrollment period for 2017 coverage, and in a limited number of cases our renewal commissions. As a result, we expect to see a meaningful reduction in our average commission rates for our aggregate individual and family health insurance plan membership in 2017 compared to 2016. In addition, the reduction in contractual commission rates and these carriers\u2019 desire to not sell individual and family health insurance has reduced the number of plans that we are able to offer on our websites, which could result in less consumer demand for the individual and family health insurance that we sell, a reduction in our membership and harm our business operating results and financial condition. In the future and as a result of health care reform or for other reasons, an increasing number of health insurance carriers may decide to reduce our commissions, rely on their own internal distribution channels, including in-house agents and carrier websites, to sell their own plans, determine not sell individual and family health insurance or otherwise limit or prohibit us from selling their plans on their ecommerce platforms. In addition to reducing commission rates, health insurance carriers may determine to exit the individual and family health insurance business in certain states or increase premiums to a significant degree, which could cause our members\u2019 health insurance to be terminated or our members to purchase new health insurance or drop it altogether. If we lose these members, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. In addition, a reduction in the individual and family health insurance products that we are able to offer could adversely impact demand for our services and a reduction in our membership, which would harm our, business, operating results and financial results.\nChanges in our management and key employees could affect our business and financial results.\nOur success is depends upon the performance of our executive officers and key personnel. Our executive officers and employees can terminate their employment at any time. We have recently experienced significant changes in our senior management. Our former chief executive officer Gary L. Lauer resigned in May 2016, and Scott N. Flanders, a member of our board of directors, was appointed as our chief executive officer. In June 2016, William T. Shaughnessy resigned from his positions as president, chief operating officer and a member of our board of directors. Our former chief financial officer, Stuart M. Huizinga, resigned in July 2016, and our new chief financial officer David K. Francis began his service with us in July 2016. In October 2016, we announced the appointment of Robert S. Hurley as president, Medicare products and Tom G. Tsao as President, small business, individual and family products. Mr. Hurley previously served as executive vice president of sales and operations, and Mr. Tsao previously served as executive vice president, chief technology and product officer. Mr. Francis also added the responsibilities of chief operations officer to his responsibilities as chief financial officer. This transition in senior management could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition as it will take time for our executive officers to transition into their roles and integrate into our business. The transition and the departure of members of our senior management could result in further attrition in our senior management and key personnel, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe loss of the services of any of our executive officers or key employees could harm our business. For example, we appoint a single writing agent with each insurance carrier. If we lose the service of our appointed writing agent, the duties of writing agent will need to be transitioned to other company personnel. Due to our national reach and the large number of carrier partners whose policies are purchased by our members, this transition may be difficult and requires a significant period of time to complete. If the transition is not successful or takes too long to complete, our agency relationship with particular insurance carriers may be terminated, our commission payments could be discontinued or delayed and, as a result, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed. Our success is also dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel for all areas of our organization. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining personnel on a timely basis, on competitive terms or at all. If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary personnel, our business would be harmed.\nOur business may be harmed if we are not successful in executing on our strategic investments and initiatives.\nWe have conducted a strategic review of our business operations and examined potential areas of investment and strategic emphasis. As a result of this review, we have determined to invest in initiatives to accelerate growth in our Medicare product sales, including Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans. We also plan to invest resources in efforts to grow our small business group insurance business and pursue cross-selling and adjacent revenue opportunities in our Medicare and small business group business. Pursuing and investing in these initiatives will require significant investments in marketing and advertising, technology and product offerings, and customer care and enrollment, among others. Our pursuit of and investment in these initiatives involves risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this Risk Factors section, including the initiatives resulting in insufficient revenue to offset any expenses associated with these new investments, inadequate return of capital on our investments, legal and regulatory compliance risks and issues not discovered in our strategic review that could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our investments and incur unanticipated liabilities. Our pursuit of these strategic initiatives may not be successful. If we are not successful in executing our business strategy, our future profitability would be negatively impacted and our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nSignificant consolidation in the health insurance industry could alter our relationships with carriers and harm our business and financial results\nThe health insurance industry in the United States has experienced a substantial amount of consolidation, resulting in a decrease in the number of health insurance carriers. Consolidation in the health insurance industry could cause a loss of or changes in our relationship with carriers and reduction in our commission or other revenue, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In the future, we may be forced to offer health insurance from a reduced number of insurance carriers or to derive a greater portion of our revenue from a more concentrated number of carriers as our business and the health insurance industry evolve. Revenue derived from Humana represented approximately 23% of our total revenue in each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016. Revenue derived from carriers owned by UnitedHealthcare represented approximately 10%, 11% and 13% of our total revenue in the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. Revenue derived from carriers owned by Aetna represented approximately 10% of our total revenue in each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. We have several agreements that govern our sale of health insurance plans with these health insurance carriers. They may be unilaterally amended or terminated by the carrier on short notice and the amendment or termination could adversely impact or cause the termination of the commission payments that we receive from these health insurance carriers, including commissions on plans that we have already sold, which could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Our revenue could be adversely impacted if we are unable to\nmaintain currently-existing levels of business with any of our significant health insurance carriers if we are unable to offset any loss of business with alternative health insurance carriers. We expect that a small number of health insurance carriers will account for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future and any impairment of our relationship with, or the material financial impairment of, these health insurance carriers could adversely affect our business.\nOur future operating results are likely to fluctuate and could fall short of expectations.\nOur operating results are likely to fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including the factors described elsewhere in this Risk Factors section, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance, particularly in light of the fact that our business and industry are undergoing substantial change as a result of health care reform and initiatives we determined to pursue as a result of our strategic review. If our revenue or operating results differ from our guidance or fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. In the past, when our revenue and operating results differed from our guidance and the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock was impacted.\nMuch of our revenue is commission revenue that we receive after an individual submits an application through us.\nA significant component of our marketing and advertising expenses consists of expenses incurred in search engine advertising at the time a consumer clicks on an advertisement and payments owed to our marketing partners as a result of applications submitted through us. As a result of any timing difference between expense and associated revenue recognition, our operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected in periods where we experience a significant increase in new applicants. For example, the Medicare annual enrollment period and the implementation of health care reform open enrollment periods for individual and family health insurance have in the past caused a substantial number of health insurance applications to be submitted through us in a short period of time and a substantial increase in marketing and advertising expenses. Because commission revenue related to any submitted applications that result in paying members is not recognized until future periods, the marketing and advertising expense associated with the submitted applications has a negative impact on operating results and cash flows in the period in which the submitted applications were received. In addition, if we incur other unanticipated or one-time expenses in a particular quarter, lose a significant amount of our member base for any reason or our commission rates are reduced, through a change in the health insurance products chosen by our members, carrier reduction in our commission rates or otherwise, the impact of our incurring increased marketing and advertising expenses would be especially pronounced and we would likely be unable to offset these expenses by increasing sales within that quarter or to replace lost revenue in the quarter with revenue from new members and our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in our financial results.\nThe seasonality of our business is outside of our control. For example, the health care reform open enrollment period has changed the seasonality of our individual and family health insurance business. Since the fourth quarter of 2013, we have experienced a greater number of individual and family health insurance submitted applications in the fourth quarter and first quarter and a lower number of submitted applications in the second and third quarter of the year compared to periods prior to the introduction of open enrollment periods. The seasonality in our business could change in the future for a number of reasons, including as a result of changes in timing of the Medicare or individual and family health plan annual open enrollment periods and changes in, and the enforceability of, the laws and regulations that govern the sale of health insurance. We may not be able to timely adjust to changes in the seasonality of our business. For example, if the timing of the open enrollment periods for Medicare-related health insurance or individual and family health insurance change, we may not be able to timely adapt to changes in customer demand. If we are not successful in responding to changes in the seasonality of our business, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. Additional information regarding the seasonality in our business is included in Part I, Item 1 Business and Item 7 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur revenue will be adversely impacted if our membership does not grow or if we are unable to retain our existing members.\nOur estimated individual and family health insurance plan membership has declined substantially since the implementation of health care reform. Our revenue has been, and will continue to be, adversely impacted if our membership does not grow. We receive revenue from commissions health insurance carriers pay to us for health insurance plans sold through our ecommerce platform. When one of these plans is canceled, or if we otherwise do not remain the agent on the policy, we no longer receive the related commission revenue. Our members may choose to discontinue their health insurance plans for a variety of reasons. For example, our members may replace a health insurance policy purchased through us with a health insurance policy provided by a new or existing employer or may determine that they can no longer afford health\ninsurance. They may also determine that they do not like the benefits and physician network covered under the plan. In addition, our members may choose to purchase new plans through other sources or use a different agent, if, for example, they are not satisfied with our customer service or the health insurance plans that we offer. Consumers may also purchase health insurance plans directly from government-run health insurance exchanges, including as a result of the requirement that subsidy-eligible individuals must purchase qualified health plans through government-run health insurance exchanges to be able to receive a subsidy under health care reform, and we would not remain the agent on the policy. Health insurance carriers have in the past and may in the future terminate health insurance plans purchased and held by our members. A significant number of our individual and family health insurance plan members experienced termination of their plans so that the plans are not effective in 2017. If we are not successful in transferring members covered under a terminated plan to another policy that we offer, we will lose these members and associated commission revenue. Our cost of acquiring a new member is substantially greater than the cost involved in maintaining our relationship with an existing member. If we are not able to successfully retain existing members and limit member turnover, our revenue and operating margins will be adversely impacted and our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed. In addition, the Medicare-related commission rates that we receive may be higher in the first calendar year of a policy if the policy is the first Medicare-related policy issued to the member. The individual and family commission rates that we receive are typically higher in the first twelve months of a policy. After the first twelve months, they generally decline significantly. As a result, if we do not add a sufficient number of members on new plans, our revenue will be negatively impacted.\nOur operating results fluctuate depending upon CMS regulations, health insurance carrier payment practices and the timing of our receipt of commission reports from health insurance carriers.\nThe timing of our revenue depends upon the timing of our receipt of commission reports and associated payments from health insurance carriers. There have been instances where the report of commissions and payment has been delayed, such as during holiday periods or as a result of the health care reform open enrollment period. We also have experienced, and may in the future experience, a delay in receiving commission payments and reports as a result of a CMS regulation prohibiting carriers from paying commissions during the fourth quarter on Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans sold during the fourth quarter with an effective date in the following year. Any delay in our receipt of commission payments or reports could materially impact our financial results for a given quarter as we would not be able to recognize the related commission revenue in that quarter. In addition, much of our commission override revenue is not reported and paid to us in accordance with a scheduled pattern, and some is only reported and paid to us once per year. The timing of our revenue recognition could also result in a large amount of commission revenue from a carrier being recorded in a given quarter that is not indicative of the amount of revenue we may receive from that carrier in subsequent quarters, causing fluctuations in our operating results. We also could report revenue below the expectations of our investors or securities analysts in any particular period if a material report or payment from a health insurance carrier were delayed or not received within the time frame required for revenue recognition.\nThe Medicare annual enrollment period and the implementation of open enrollment periods under health care reform for the purchase of individual and family health insurance present a challenge as they require us to enroll a significant number of individuals into health insurance over a limited period of time. Significant increases in enrollment activity over a limited amount of time may also make it difficult for health insurance carriers to timely and accurately report commission information to us. To the extent health insurance carriers have difficulty in reporting timely and accurate commission information to us, we may be unable to recognize revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies, which could cause us to defer substantial revenue until such time our health insurance carriers are able to resume reporting timely and accurate commission information to us. CMS has proposed to reduce the length of the open enrollment period for individual and family health insurance. If this proposal becomes final, it could increase the challenges we face in connection with the open enrollment period and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe medical loss ratio requirements that are a part of health care reform may harm our business.\nThe Affordable Care Act contains provisions requiring health insurance carriers to maintain specified medical loss ratios. The medical loss ratio requirements for both individual and family and small business health insurance require health insurance companies to spend 80% of their premium revenue in each of their individual and small group health insurance businesses on reimbursement for clinical services and activities that improve health care quality. The medical loss ratio requirement for Medicare Advantage plans is 85%. If a health insurance carrier fails to meet medical loss ratio requirements, the health insurance carrier is required to rebate a portion of its premium revenue to its members to make up for the difference.\nCarrier reaction to the individual and family medical loss ratio requirements was to significantly reduce the commissions we receive in connection with the sale of individual and family health insurance. Health insurance carriers may determine to reduce or further reduce our Medicare Advantage plan, individual and family, or small group commissions as a\nresult of the medical loss ratio requirements or other aspects of health care reform, including any increased expenses in complying with or dealing with the impact of health care reform, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, if health insurance companies fail to meet medical loss ratio requirements, we may be required to pay back commissions that are related to any premium amounts the carriers are required to rebate policyholders as a result, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. The medical loss ratio requirements also may cause certain health insurance carriers to limit the geographies in which they sell health insurance or exit certain markets altogether, place less reliance on agents to distribute their plans, or limit their health insurance offerings in any number of other ways, each of which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. The implementation of medical loss ratio requirements has caused and could further cause health insurance carriers to reduce the amount they are willing to spend in connection with our sponsorship and advertising and technology licensing businesses, which also could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business may be harmed if we lose our relationship with health insurance carriers whose Medicare-related health insurance products we sell or if our relationship with those carriers changes.\nOur Medicare plan-related revenue is concentrated in a small number of health insurance carriers. The success of our Medicare-related health insurance business depends upon our ability to enter into new and maintain existing relationships with health insurance carriers on favorable economic terms. The concentration of our Medicare plan sales in a limited number of health insurance carriers makes us vulnerable to changes in carrier commission rates and changes in the competitiveness of our carriers\u2019 Medicare products. If our Medicare carriers reduce our commission rates, reduce the amount they pay us for advertising services, or the competitiveness of their products declines compared to original Medicare or the products of Medicare carriers with which we do not have a relationship, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nIn addition, we may temporarily or permanently lose the ability to market and sell Medicare plans for our Medicare plan carriers. For instance, a carrier may terminate our relationship. Moreover, CMS heavily regulates the sale of Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans and has and will continue to penalize health insurance carriers for certain regulatory violations by suspending or terminating the carrier's ability to market and sell Medicare plans for significant periods of time. CMS also may require the carrier to terminate its membership and allow its members to move to other plans. Given the concentration of our Medicare plan sales in a small number of carriers, if we lose a relationship with a health insurance carrier to market their Medicare plans temporarily or permanently or if the health insurance carrier loses its Medicare product membership, our sales as a health insurance agent and Medicare plan related revenue could suffer significantly, and our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed. The agreements that we have with health insurance carriers to sell Medicare plans may be unilaterally amended or terminated by the carrier on short notice and the amendment or termination could adversely impact, or cause the termination of, the commission payments that we receive for selling their Medicare plans, including commissions on plans that we have already sold, which could materially harm our business operating results and financial condition.\nOur business may be harmed if we do not market Medicare plans effectively or if our websites and marketing materials are not timely approved.\nHealth insurance carriers whose Medicare plans we sell approve our websites, much of our marketing material and our call center scripts. We must receive these approvals in order for us to be able to generate Medicare plan demand and sell Medicare plans to Medicare-eligible individuals as a health insurance agent. Many of these materials also must be filed with CMS. In addition, we use Medicare plan cost and benefit data collected and made publicly available by CMS. In the event that CMS or a health insurance carrier requires change to, disapproves, or delays approval of our websites, our marketing material or call center scripts, or if CMS does not timely release Medicare plan cost and benefit data for the following year\u2019s Medicare plans prior to the annual enrollment period, we could lose a significant source of Medicare plan demand and our ability to sell Medicare plans would be adversely impacted, each of which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. CMS broadened its interpretation of rules and regulations relating to Medicare plan-related marketing material so that they apply to websites that we did not previously need to submit to health insurance carriers for approval and file with CMS. This broadened interpretation also applies the same approval and filing process to marketing material of our marketing partners. If we are not successful in timely submitting these marketing materials to health insurance carriers for approval, in gaining that approval and in filing the marketing material with CMS, our Medicare plan marketing could become less effective, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Many of our marketing partners have not consented to the filing of their marketing material with CMS. If a marketing partner of ours does not consent to having its website or other marketing material filed with the CMS, does not make changes required by carriers or CMS or does not comply with the CMS marketing guidelines or other Medicare program related laws, rules and regulations, we may lose the ability to receive referrals\nof individuals interested in purchasing Medicare plans from that marketing partner or our ability to receive referral could be delayed and our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nIn addition, each time we or our marketing partners substantively change our websites or call center scripts after they are filed with CMS, we may need to resubmit them to our health insurance carriers and have them filed with CMS. We are not permitted to make CMS filings ourselves. Given the review cycles our scripts, websites and other marketing material undergo, it is very difficult and time consuming to make changes to them, and our inability to timely make changes to these marketing materials, whether to comply with new rules and regulations or otherwise could adversely impact our ability to sell Medicare plans during the Medicare annual enrollment period or otherwise, which could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, if a change to scripts or websites is required by CMS or health insurance carriers, we may be prevented from selling Medicare plans during this period of review, which would harm our business, operating results, and financial condition, particularly if it occurred during the annual enrollment period.\nOur ability to sell Medicare-related health insurance plans as a health insurance agent depends upon our ability to timely hire, train and retain licensed health insurance agents for our customer care center.\nIn addition to our websites, we rely upon our customer care centers to sell Medicare plans. The success of our customer care center operations is largely dependent on licensed health insurance agents and other employees. In order to sell Medicare-related health insurance plans, our health insurance agent employees must first be licensed by the states in which they are selling plans and certified and appointed with the health insurance carrier that offers the plans in each state that the Medicare-related health insurance product is being sold by the agent. Because a significant number of Medicare plans are sold in the fourth quarter each year during the Medicare annual enrollment period, we hire and train a significant number of additional employees on a temporary or seasonal basis in a limited period of time. It may be difficult for the health insurance agents we employ and our systems and processes to handle the increased volume of health insurance transactions that occur in a short period of time during the Medicare annual enrollment period. We must also ensure that our health insurance agent employees are timely licensed in a significant number of states and certified and appointed with the health insurance carriers whose products we sell. We depend upon state departments of insurance and health insurance carriers for the licensing, certification and appointment of our health insurance agent employees. We may not be successful in timely hiring a sufficient number of additional licensed agents or other employees for the Medicare annual enrollment period, and even if we are successful, these employees may experience delays in obtaining health insurance licenses and certifications and health insurance carrier appointments with our health insurance carrier partners. If we and our health insurance agent employees are not successful in these regards, our ability to sell Medicare-related health insurance plans will be impaired during the annual enrollment period, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur ability to sell Medicare-related health insurance plans as a health insurance agent depends upon maintenance of functioning information technology systems.\nThe success of our Medicare plan customer care center operations is dependent on information technology systems. The vast majority of our Medicare plan members utilize our customer care center in connection with their purchase of a Medicare plan. CMS rules require that our health insurance agent employees utilize CMS-approved scripts in connection with the sale of Medicare plans and that we record and maintain the recording of telephonic interactions relating to the sale of Medicare plans. We rely on telephone, call recording, customer relationship management and other systems and technology in our Medicare customer care center operations, and we are dependent upon third parties for some of them, including our telephone and call recording systems. These systems have failed temporarily in the past. The effectiveness and stability of our Medicare customer care center systems and technology are critical to our ability to sell Medicare plans, particularly during the Medicare annual enrollment period, and the failure or interruption of any of these systems and technology or any inability to handle increased volume during the annual enrollment period would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur success in selling Medicare-related health insurance will depend upon a number of factors some of which our outside of our control.\nWe determined to enter into the Medicare plan market because we believe the number of individuals becoming eligible for Medicare is increasing and these individuals are increasingly using the Internet to shop for health insurance plans. We also believe that, on average, member retention rates and the commissions that health insurance carriers pay in connection with the sale of Medicare plans compare favorably to the member retention rates and commissions we receive in connection with our sale of individual and family health insurance. Should we prove to be wrong, or should these circumstances reverse, our success in marketing Medicare plans would be materially and adversely impacted, which could harm our business, operating\nresults and financial condition. For instance, portions of health care reform impose significant changes to original Medicare and the Medicare Advantage program by, among other things, increasing benefits original Medicare provides, reducing payments to Medicare Advantage plans and imposing medical loss ratio requirements for Medicare Advantage plans. In addition, CMS has in the past determined to reduce the payments it makes to health insurance carriers in connection with the sale of Medicare Advantage plans and it may do so again in the future. These reductions have caused, and could in the future cause, the cost of Medicare Advantage plans to increase or the benefits under Medicare Advantage plans to decrease, either of which would impair our ability to sell Medicare Advantage plans and our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. They also may cause health insurance carriers to reduce our compensation, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe majority of our Medicare-related health insurance plan sales occur over the telephone. Telephone sales of Medicare related health insurance require a licensed health insurance agent to complete and are time consuming compared to sales over the Internet. Given the resources required in connection with telephonic Medicare related health insurance sales, it may prove difficult for us to continue to grow our Medicare-related health insurance sales compared to prior periods. Even if we are able to grow those sales, it may be expensive to add the additional resources necessary for the growth. If we are not able to scalably grow our Medicare related health insurance sales over the Internet or in other ways that require fewer resources, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nOur success in the Medicare plan market as a health insurance agent will also depend upon a number of additional factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to continue to adapt our ecommerce platforms to market Medicare plans, including our development or acquisition of marketing tools and features important in the sale of Medicare plans online and the effective modification of our user experience;\n\u2022\nour success in marketing to Medicare-eligible individuals and in entering into marketing partner relationships to drive Medicare-eligible individuals to our ecommerce platforms on a cost-effective basis;\n\u2022\nour effectiveness in entering into and maintaining relationships with marketing partners that refer Medicare-eligible individuals to us;\n\u2022\nour ability to hire and retain additional employees with experience in Medicare, including our ability to timely implement Medicare sales expertise into our customer care centers;\n\u2022\nour ability to implement and maintain an effective information technology infrastructure for the sale of Medicare plans, including the infrastructure and systems that support our websites, call centers and call recording;\n\u2022\nour ability to leverage technology in order to sell, and otherwise become more efficient at selling, Medicare-related plans over the telephone;\n\u2022\nour ability to comply with the numerous, complex and changing laws and regulations and CMS guidelines relating to the marketing and sale of Medicare plans, including continuing to conform our online and offline sales processes to those laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness with which our competitors market the availability of Medicare plans from sources other than our ecommerce platforms.\nAs a result of these factors, we may prove unsuccessful in marketing Medicare plans and acting as a health insurance agent in connection with their sale, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, if our efforts to market Medicare plans during any annual enrollment period were impeded due to lack of health insurance carrier or CMS approval, or for other reasons, the impact on our business, operating results and financial condition would be significantly greater given the seasonality of our Medicare-related revenues, membership acquisition and expenses and the fact that much of the sales of Medicare plans occur during this period.\nThe marketing and sale of Medicare plans are subject to numerous, complex and frequently changing laws and regulations, and non-compliance or changes in laws and regulations could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe marketing and sale of Medicare plans are subject to numerous laws, regulations and guidelines at the federal and state level. The marketing and sale of Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans are principally regulated by CMS. The marketing and sale of Medicare Supplement plans are principally regulated on a state-by-state basis by state departments of insurance. The laws and regulations applicable to the marketing and sale of Medicare plans are numerous, ambiguous and complex, and, particularly with respect to regulations and guidance issued by CMS for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, change frequently. The telephone calls on which we enroll individuals into Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans are required to be recorded. Health insurance carriers audit these recordings for compliance and listen to them in connection with their investigation of complaints pursuant to CMS rules and regulations. In addition, Medicare eligible individuals often receive a special election period and the ability to change Medicare Advantage and Part D prescription drug plans outside the Medicare annual enrollment period in the event the sale of the plan was not in accordance with CMS rules and guidelines. Given CMS\u2019s scrutiny of Medicare product health insurance carriers and the responsibility of the health insurance carriers for actions that we take, health insurance carriers may terminate our relationship with them or take other corrective action if our Medicare product sales, marketing and operations are not in compliance or gives rise to too many complaints. The termination of our relationship with health insurance carriers for this reason would reduce the products we are able to offer, result in the loss of commissions for past and future sales and would otherwise harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAs a result of the laws, regulations and guidelines relating to the sale of Medicare plans, we have altered, and likely will have to continue to alter, our websites and sales process to comply with several requirements that are not applicable to our sale of non-Medicare-related health insurance plans. For instance, many aspects of our online platforms and our marketing material and processes, as well as changes to these platforms, materials and processes, including call center scripts, must be filed on a regular basis with CMS and reviewed and approved by health insurance carriers in light of CMS requirements. In addition, certain aspects of our Medicare plan marketing partner relationships have been in the past, and will be in the future, subjected to CMS and health insurance carrier review. Changes to the laws, regulations and guidelines relating to Medicare plans, their interpretation or the manner in which they are enforced could be incompatible with these relationships, our platforms or our sale of Medicare plans. For instance, we recently experienced a reduction in lead volume from certain business development partners as a result of CMS rule related changes to their advertising. In addition, a change in sales and marketing guidelines issued by CMS resulted in our making changes to our Medicare product sales and marketing processes during the third quarter of 2016 that impacted the effectiveness of our call center agents in converting leads into submitted applications. In February 2015 CMS issued guidance indicating that third party websites and marketing material must be filed for approval with CMS. Health insurance carriers have interpreted this guidance to mean that websites and marketing material of our marketing partners must go through the process of CMS filing and review and approval by health insurance carriers. Our marketing partners may not consent to having their websites or other marketing material filed with CMS. In addition, we have a number of marketing partners who refer leads to us for Medicare-related health insurance products. Given the resources and review required of us and health insurance carriers prior to CMS filing, it is unlikely that we will be able to have all of our marketing partner websites and material filed and approved by CMS, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Even for our marketing partner websites and marketing material that are filed with CMS, they may not make it through the review process in time for the Medicare annual enrollment period. Moreover, under CMS guidance, websites and marketing material must be refiled with CMS if changed, which make it difficult to adapt and optimize our own websites and marketing material as well as our marketing partner websites and marketing material in a short amount of time and could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nDue to changes in CMS guidance or enforcement or interpretation of existing guidance applicable to our marketing and sale of Medicare products, or as a result of new laws, regulations and guidelines, CMS, state departments of insurance or health insurance carriers may determine to object to or not to approve aspects of our online platforms or marketing material and processes and may determine that certain existing aspects of our Medicare-related business are not in compliance. As a result, the progress of our Medicare operations could be slowed or we could be prevented from operating aspects of our Medicare revenue generating activities altogether, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition, particularly if it occurred during the Medicare annual enrollment period.\nCMS has in the past proposed changing the rules relating to compensation of agents in connection with the sale of Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to reduce our compensation as a health insurance agent in connection with the sale of these plans. In the event CMS adopts regulations that have the effect of reducing the compensation that we receive in connection with the sale of Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed. For instance, CMS recently proposed a rule that would prohibit\ncarriers from paying the administrative fees that constitute a significant portion of our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plan commission revenue on a per member basis. If the rule becomes final, it is unclear whether carriers will pay the administrative fees in another manner and, even if they do, the timeframe in which the alternative would be implemented. As a result, finalization of the rule could adversely impact our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plan commission revenue and harm our business, operating results and financial condition. CMS also issued a regulation prohibiting carriers from paying commissions during the fourth quarter on Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans sold during the fourth quarter with an effective date in the following year, which negatively impacts our operating cash flows in the fourth quarter of the year. This regulation also makes it more difficult for us to recognize revenue relating to our sale of Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans in the fourth quarter of the year, given that our revenue recognition policy requires us to receive either a cash payment or commission statement in the period we recognize revenue, provided we receive the second corroborating communication shortly following the period of recognition. If health insurance carriers do not send at least one of these communications during the fourth quarter, our recognition of revenue relating to our sale of these policies in the fourth quarter will be delayed until we receive the first communication, which would adversely impact our financial results in the fourth quarter. In the event the actions of the federal government, state governments or other circumstances decrease the demand for the Medicare related health insurance that we sell, or result in a reduction in the amount paid to us or impact the timing of our revenue recognition in connection with the sale of these plans, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe may be unsuccessful in competing effectively against current and future competitors.\nThe market for selling health insurance plans is highly competitive. We compete with entities and individuals that offer and sell health insurance plans utilizing traditional distribution channels as well as the Internet. Our competitors include local insurance agents across the United States who sell health insurance plans in their communities. There also are a number of companies that operate websites, provide an online shopping experience for consumers interested in purchasing health insurance and act as a health insurance agent in connection with that purchase. Some local agents also use Internet advertising and \u201clead aggregator\u201d services that use the Internet to find consumers interested in purchasing health insurance and are compensated for referring those consumers to health insurance agents or carriers. Many health insurance carriers also directly market and sell their plans to consumers through call centers, Internet advertising and their own websites. Although we offer health insurance plans for many of these carriers, they also compete with us by offering their plans directly to consumers. In connection with our marketing of Medicare plans, we compete with the original Medicare program. CMS also offers plan information, comparison tools, call centers and online enrollment for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. We compete with the FFM and state health insurance exchanges implemented as a result of health care reform in marketing individual and family health insurance products. Health care reform also has resulted in health insurance plan cost and benefit data being more readily accessible, which could facilitate additional competition.\nTo remain competitive against our current and future competitors, we will need to market our services effectively and continue to improve the online shopping experience and functionalities of our website and other platforms that our current and future customers may access to purchase health insurance products from us. If we cannot predict, develop and deliver the right shopping experience and functionality in a timely and cost-effective manner, or if we are not effective in cost-effectively driving a substantial number of consumers interested in purchasing health insurance to our website and customer care centers, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors and our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nSome of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. As compared to us, our current and future competitors may be able to:\n\u2022\nundertake more extensive marketing campaigns for their brands and services;\n\u2022\ndevote more resources to website and systems development;\n\u2022\nnegotiate more favorable commission rates and commission override payments; and\n\u2022\nmake more attractive offers to potential employees, marketing partners and third-party service providers.\nIn addition, CMS has the ability to regulate our marketing and sale of Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, and government-run health insurance exchanges, including CMS with respect to the FFM, have the ability to regulate our marketing and sale of qualified health plans under health care reform. CMS and the exchanges could impact the commissions we receive in connection with the sale of these plans and impose other restrictions and limitations that\nmake it difficult for us to sell them. Competitive pressures may result in our experiencing increased marketing costs, decreased traffic to our website and loss of market share, or may otherwise harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we are not successful in cost-effectively converting visitors to our website and customer call centers into members for which we receive commissions, our business and operating results would be harmed.\nOur growth depends in large part upon growth in our membership. The rate at which consumers visiting our ecommerce platform and customer care centers seeking to purchase health insurance are converted into paying members is a significant factor in the growth of our membership. A number of factors have influenced, and could in the future influence, the conversion rate for any given period, some of which are outside of our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer shopping behavior due to circumstances outside of our control, such as economic conditions, consumers\u2019 ability or willingness to pay for health insurance, availability of unemployment benefits or proposed or enacted legislative or regulatory changes impacting our business, including health care reform;\n\u2022\nthe quality of and changes to the consumer experience on our ecommerce platform or with our customer care center;\n\u2022\nregulatory requirements, including those that make the experience on our online platforms cumbersome or difficult to navigate;\n\u2022\nthe variety, competitiveness and affordability of the health insurance plans that we offer;\n\u2022\nsystem failures or interruptions in the operation of our ecommerce platform or call center operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in the mix of consumers who are referred to us through our direct, marketing partner and online advertising member acquisition channels;\n\u2022\nhealth insurance carriers offering the health insurance plans for which consumers have expressed interest, and the degree to which our technology is integrated with those carriers;\n\u2022\nhealth insurance carrier guidelines applicable to applications submitted by consumers, the amount of time a carrier takes to make a decision on that application and the percentage of submitted applications approved by health insurance carriers;\n\u2022\nthe percentage of our members who did not accept their approved policies and from whom we do not receive commission payments; and\n\u2022\nour ability to enroll subsidy-eligible individuals in qualified health plans through government-run health insurance exchanges and the efficacy of the process we are required to use to do so.\nOur conversion rates can be impacted by changes in the mix of consumers referred to us through our member acquisition channels. For example, under the current process we are required to use to enroll subsidy-eligible individuals into qualified health plans through the FFM, our conversion rate for subsidy-eligible individuals is relatively lower than for non-subsidy eligible individuals. In addition, we have experienced an increase in the percentage of mobile phone and tablet visitors to our platforms, and the conversion rate for individuals who use our mobile and tablet platforms to shop for and purchase health insurance has historically been lower than desktop and laptop users. We may make changes to our ecommerce platforms in response to regulatory requirements or undertake other initiatives in an attempt to improve consumer experience or for other reasons. These changes have in the past, and may in the future, have the unintended consequence of adversely impacting our conversion rates. A decline in the percentage of consumers who submit health insurance applications on our ecommerce platforms or telephonically via our customer care centers and are converted into members could cause an increase in our cost of acquiring members on a per member basis. To the extent the rate at which we convert consumers visiting our ecommerce platforms or telephonically via our customer care centers into members suffers, or in the event the number of mobile and tablet visitors to our platforms continue to increase, our membership growth rate may decline, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur conversion rates are also impacted by changes in both the percentage of submitted applications that are approved by carriers as well as changes in the percentage of our members who do not accept their approved policies. Any decline in the percentage of submitted applications that result in paying members will adversely impact our commission revenue as well as\nour membership, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Given that individual and family health insurance purchasing is concentrated during the annual open enrollment period, we may experience a shift in the mix of individual and family health insurance products selected by our new members over a short period of time. Any reduction in our average commission revenue per member during the open enrollment period caused by such a shift or otherwise would also harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in the quality and affordability of the health insurance plans that carriers offer on our ecommerce platforms could harm our business and operating results.\nThe demand for health insurance marketed through our ecommerce platforms is impacted by, among other things, the variety, quality and price of the health insurance plans we offer. Many health insurance carriers, including major national health insurance carriers, have exited a large number of state insurance markets where we have historically represented their insurance plans or determined to pay reduced or no commissions for the sale of their plans. We have determined not to sell health insurance products for which we do not receive commissions. As a result of these circumstances, the number of individual and family health insurance plans we offer to sell on our website has reduced significantly and there are many states and zip codes we do not offer any individual and family health insurance. This reduction in supply has adversely impacted, and may in the future adversely impact, demand for the individual and family health insurance we sell. If our ability to sell a variety of high-quality, affordable health insurance plans in the Medicare, individual and family, small business and ancillary product markets is impaired, or our health insurance plan offerings are limited or terminated as a result of consolidation in the health insurance industry, health care reform or otherwise, our sales or average commission rate per member may decrease and our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. In addition, the cost of health insurance has increased substantially in many states as a result of health care reform implementation, which has reduced demand for individual and family health insurance. To the extent these conditions persist or worsen, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our business and operating results will be harmed.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand identity is critical to our relationships with existing members, marketing partners and health insurance carriers and to our ability to attract new members, marketing partners and health insurance carriers. The promotion of our brand in these and other ways may require us to make substantial investments and we anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive, these branding initiatives may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Our brand promotion activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue, and to the extent that these activities yield increased revenue, the increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur and our operating results could be harmed. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our brand, our business may not grow and we could lose our relationships with health insurance carriers, marketing partners and/or members, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, we have historically received media attention in connection with our public relations efforts. While we cannot be certain of the impact of media coverage on our business, if it were to be reduced or if we were to receive negative publicity, the number of consumers visiting our platforms or customer call centers could decrease, and our cost of acquiring members could increase as a result of a reduction in the number of members coming from our direct member acquisition channel, both of which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSystem failures or capacity constraints could harm our business and operating results.\nThe performance, reliability and availability of our ecommerce platforms and underlying network infrastructures are critical to our financial results, our brand and our relationship with members, marketing partners and health insurance carriers. Although we regularly attempt to enhance our ecommerce platform and system infrastructure, system failures and interruptions may occur if we are unsuccessful in these efforts, if we are unable to accurately project the rate or timing of increases in our website traffic or for other reasons, some of which are completely outside our control. Although we have experienced only minor system failures and interruptions to date, we could experience significant failures and interruptions in the future, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. If these failures or interruptions occurred during the Medicare annual enrollment period or during the open enrollment period under health care reform, the negative impact on us would be particularly pronounced.\nWe rely in part upon third-party vendors, including data center and bandwidth providers, to operate our ecommerce platforms. We cannot predict whether additional network capacity will be available from these vendors as we need it, and our network or our suppliers\u2019 networks might be unable to achieve or maintain a sufficiently high capacity of data transmission to allow us to process health insurance applications in a timely manner or effectively download data, especially if our website\ntraffic increases. Any system failure that causes an interruption in or decreases the responsiveness of our services would impair our revenue-generating capabilities and harm our business and operating results and damage our reputation. In addition, any loss of data could result in loss of customers and subject us to potential liability. Our database and systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, earthquakes, fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, acts of terrorism, other attempts to harm our systems and similar events. In addition, our operations are vulnerable to earthquakes in the San Francisco Bay Area and elsewhere in Northern California.\nConsumers may access our customer care centers for assistance in connection with submitting health insurance applications. We depend upon third parties, including telephone service providers and third party software providers, to operate our customer care centers. Any failure of the systems that we rely upon in the operation of our customer care centers could negatively impact sales as well as our relationship with consumers and members, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe depend upon Internet search engines to attract a significant portion of the consumers who visit our website, and if we are unable to effectively advertise on search engines on a cost-effective basis, our business and operating results would be harmed.\nWe derive a significant portion of our website traffic from consumers who search for health insurance through Internet search engines, such as Google, Bing and Yahoo!. A critical factor in attracting consumers to our website is whether we are prominently displayed in response to an Internet search relating to health insurance. Search engines typically provide two types of search results, algorithmic listings and paid advertisements. We rely on both to attract consumers to our websites.\nAlgorithmic search result listings are determined and displayed in accordance with a set of formulas or algorithms developed by the particular Internet search engine. The algorithms determine the order of the listing of results in response to the consumer\u2019s Internet search. From time to time, search engines revise these algorithms. In some instances, these modifications have caused our website to be listed less prominently in algorithmic search results, which has resulted in decreased traffic to our website. We may also be listed less prominently as a result of new websites or changes to existing websites that result in these websites receiving higher algorithmic rankings with the search engine. For example, government health insurance exchange websites appear prominently in algorithmic search results. Our website may become listed less prominently in algorithmic search results for other reasons, such as search engine technical difficulties, search engine technical changes and changes we make to our website. In addition, search engines have deemed the practices of some companies to be inconsistent with search engine guidelines and decided not to list their website in search result listings at all. If we are listed less prominently in, or removed altogether from, search result listings for any reason, the traffic to our websites would decline and we may not be able to replace this traffic, which in turn would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. If we decide to attempt to replace this traffic, we may be required to increase our marketing expenditures, which would also increase our cost of member acquisition and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe purchase paid advertisements on search engines in order to attract consumers to our website. We typically pay a search engine for prominent placement of our name and website when particular health insurance-related terms are searched for on the search engine, regardless of the algorithmic search result listings. The prominence of the placement of our advertisement is determined by a combination of factors, including the amount we are willing to pay and algorithms designed to determine the relevance of our paid advertisement to a particular search term. As with algorithmic search result listings, search engines may revise the algorithms relevant to paid advertisements and websites other than our ecommerce platform may become more optimized for the algorithms. These changes may result in our having to pay increased amounts to maintain our paid advertisement placement in response to a particular search term. We could also have to pay increased amounts should the market share of major search engines continue to become more concentrated with a single search engine. Additionally, we bid against our competitors and others for the display of these paid search engine advertisements. Many of our competitors, including many health insurance carriers and government-run health insurance exchanges, have greater resources with which to bid and better brand recognition than we do. We have experienced increased competition from health insurance carriers, government health insurance exchanges and some of our marketing partners for both algorithmic search result listings and for paid advertisements. This competition has increased the cost of paid internet search advertising and has increased our marketing and advertising expenses. This competition has increased substantially during the open enrollment periods for individual and family health insurance and Medicare related health insurance and may increase further if these open enrollment periods occur over the same period of time. If paid search advertising costs increase or become cost prohibitive, whether as a results of competition, algorithm changes or otherwise our advertising expenses could rise significantly or we could reduce or discontinue our paid search advertisements, either of which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe rely significantly on marketing partners and our business and operating results would be harmed if we are unable to maintain effective relationships with our existing marketing partners or if we do not establish successful relationships with new marketing partners.\nIn addition to marketing through Internet search engines, we frequently enter into contractual marketing relationships with other online and offline businesses that promote us. These marketing partners include financial and online service companies, affiliate programs and online advertisers and content providers. We also have relationships with marketing partners, including pharmacy chains that promote our Medicare platforms to their customers. We compensate many of our marketing partners for their referrals on a submitted health insurance application basis and, if they are licensed to sell health insurance, may share a percentage of the commission we earn from the health insurance carrier for each member referred by the marketing partner.\nMany factors influence the success of our relationship with our marketing partners, including:\n\u2022\nthe continued positive market presence, reputation and growth of the marketing partner;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of the marketing partner in marketing our website and services, including whether the marketing partner is successful in maintaining the prominence of its website in algorithmic search result listings and paid Internet advertisements;\n\u2022\nthe compliance of our marketing partners, and of the manner marketing partners refer consumers to our platforms, with applicable laws, regulations and guidelines;\n\u2022\nthe interest of the marketing partner\u2019s customers in the health insurance plans that we offer on our ecommerce platform;\n\u2022\nthe contractual terms we negotiate with the marketing partner, including the marketing fees we agree to pay a marketing partner;\n\u2022\nthe percentage of the marketing partner\u2019s customers that submit applications or purchase health insurance policies through our ecommerce platform;\n\u2022\nthe ability of a marketing partner to maintain efficient and uninterrupted operation of its website; and\n\u2022\nour ability to work with the marketing partner to implement website changes, launch marketing campaigns and pursue other initiatives necessary to maintain positive consumer experiences and acceptable traffic volumes.\nFor instance, we partner with Internet lead aggregators who refer a significant number of consumers to our online platforms. Major search engines have in the past and may in the future determine not to list lead aggregator websites prominently in search result listings for various reasons, which would cause a significant reduction in the number of consumers referred to us through our marketing partner channel. While we have relationships with a large number of marketing partners, we depend upon referrals from a limited number of marketing partners for a significant portion of the submitted applications we receive from our marketing partner customer acquisition channel. Moreover, a significant portion of our referrals for the purchase of Medicare plans comes from a single marketing partner.\nGiven our reliance on our marketing partners, our business operating results and financial condition would be harmed if any of the following were to occur:\n\u2022\nif we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our existing marketing partners, particularly marketing partners responsible for a significant number of our submitted applications;\n\u2022\nif we fail to establish successful relationships with new marketing partners;\n\u2022\nif we experience competition in our receipt of referrals from our high volume marketing partners; and\n\u2022\nif we are required to pay increased amounts to our marketing partners.\nTo the extent that health care reform makes it less profitable or desirable for marketing partners to promote us to their customers, we may lose relationships with existing marketing partners or those marketing partners may refer fewer individuals\nto us. We may also have difficulty entering into relationships with new marketing partners. We may also need to reduce the compensation that we pay to marketing partners to the extent that health care reform has the effect of reducing commissions for individual and family health insurance or causes our members to stay on their health insurance policies for a shorter period of time. There is no guarantee that we will be able to amend our agreements to reduce the compensation that we pay to acceptable levels in light of these factors. If we are not able to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. Competition for referrals from our marketing partners has increased particularly during the open enrollment periods for Medicare-related health insurance and individual and family health insurance. We may lose marketing partner referrals if our competitors pay marketing partners more than we do or be forced to pay increased fees to our marketing partners, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. If we lose marketing partner referrals during the Medicare or individual and family health insurance annual open enrollment periods, the adverse impact on our business would be particularly pronounced. In addition, the promulgation of laws, regulations or guidelines, or the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and guidelines, by state departments of insurance or by CMS, could cause our relationships with our marketing partners to be in non-compliance with those laws, regulations and guidelines. For instance, CMS issued guidance that health insurance carriers have interpreted to mean that websites and marketing material of our Medicare-related marketing partners must be filed with CMS before use. Before filing with CMS, these websites and marketing materials will need to undergo a review by health insurance carriers for whom we market Medicare products. Our marketing partners may not consent to having their websites or other marketing material filed with CMS, and we and health insurance carriers may not be able to dedicate the resources necessary to have the websites and marketing material reviewed. If we are not able to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. In addition, as a result of our acquisition of PlanPrescriber, we have marketing partner relationships with pharmacy chains that utilize aspects of our platform and tools. Our relationships with these pharmacy chains result in the referral of a significant number of individuals to us who are interested in purchasing Medicare-related health insurance plans. If CMS or state departments of insurance were to change existing laws, regulations or guidelines, or interpret existing laws, regulations or guidelines, to prohibit these arrangements, or if pharmacy partners otherwise decided to no longer utilize aspects of our platform and tools, we could experience a significant decline in the number of Medicare-eligible individuals who are referred to our platforms and customer care centers, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe rely on health insurance carriers to accurately and regularly prepare commission reports, and if these reports are inaccurate or not sent to us in a timely manner, our business and operating results could be harmed. We also may not recognize trends in our membership as a result of a lack of information from health insurance carriers.\nWe rely on health insurance carriers to timely and accurately report the amount of commissions earned by us, and we calculate our commission revenue, prepare our financial reports, projections and budgets and direct our marketing and other operating efforts based on the reports we receive from health insurance carriers. There have been instances where we have determined that policy cancellation data reported to us by a health insurance carrier has not been accurate. Although we recognize commissions reported to us net of estimated cancellations, the extent to which health insurance carriers are inaccurate in their reporting of policy cancellations could cause us to change our cancellation estimates, which could adversely impact our revenues. We apply judgment and make estimates based on historical data and current trends to independently determine whether or not carriers are accurately reporting commissions due to us. To the extent that health insurance carriers understate or fail to accurately report the amount of commissions due to us in a timely manner or at all, we will not recognize revenue to which we are entitled, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe depend on health insurance carriers and others for data related to our membership. For instance, with respect to health insurance plans other than small business health insurance, health insurance carriers do not directly report member cancellations to us, resulting in the need for us to determine cancellations using payment data that carriers provide. We infer cancellations from this payment data by analyzing whether payments from members have ceased for a period of time, and we may not learn of a cancellation for several months. With respect to our small business membership, many groups notify the carrier directly with respect to increases or decreases in group size and policy cancellations. Our insurance carrier partners often do not communicate this information to us, and it often takes a significant amount of time for us to learn about small business group cancellations and changes in our membership within the group itself. We often are not made aware of policy cancellations until the time of the group\u2019s annual renewal.\nA substantial number of our existing members may become eligible for health care reform subsidies in connection with their purchase of health insurance. In addition, the open enrollment periods applicable in connection with the sale of both individual and family health insurance and Medicare-related health insurance condenses purchasing activity over a limited period of time. The increased amount of health insurance purchasing activity and member movement as a result of health care reform over a limited period of time as well as any member turnover that we experience may make it difficult for health insurance carriers to accurately report commission information to us in a timely manner, which would also make it difficult or impossible for us to accurately report and estimate our membership at any given point in time. Delays in accurate reporting of\ncommissions may result in delays in recognition of commission revenue compared to historical patterns and our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. In addition, if we experience a disruption in our ability to accurately estimate our membership it could result in a decrease in our stock price as a result of uncertainty relating to our membership base.\nAfter we have estimated membership for a period, we may receive information from health insurance carriers that would have impacted the estimate if we had received the information prior to the date of estimation. We may receive commission payments or other information that indicates that a member who was not included in our estimates for a prior period was in fact an active member at that time, or that a member who was included in our estimates was in fact not an active member of ours. We also reconcile information health insurance carriers provide to us and may determine that we were not historically paid commissions owed to us, which would cause us to have underestimated our membership. As a result of open enrollment periods, we may not receive information from our carriers on as timely a basis due to significant spikes in volume, which could impair the accuracy of our estimates of the number of our members. Additionally, health insurance carriers may require us to return commission payments paid in a prior period due to policy cancellations for members we previously estimated as being active. For these and other reasons, including if current trends in membership cancellation are inconsistent with past cancellation trends that we use to estimate our membership or if carriers subsequently report changes to the commission payments that they previously reported to us, our actual membership could be different from our estimates, perhaps materially. Total revenue per estimated member for the period would also change if our estimated membership changed. Our estimate regarding the average amount of time our members maintain their health insurance plans also could be inaccurate as it depends on the accuracy of our membership estimates.\nEconomic conditions and other factors beyond our control may negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur revenue depends upon demand for health insurance in the individual and family and small business markets, which can be influenced by a variety of factors beyond our control. For instance, as a result of substantial health insurance premium inflation in recent years, we believe that many employers have sought to reduce the costs associated with providing health insurance to their employees, including offering fewer benefits to employees, reducing or eliminating dependent coverage, increasing employee health insurance premium contributions and eliminating health insurance benefits altogether. We have no control over the economic and other factors that influence these trends, and they may reverse. If economic or other factors beyond our control negatively impact our business, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe believe that demand for the health insurance and services we offer are impacted by prevailing economic conditions. We cannot be certain of the future impact that economic conditions will have on our business. A softening of demand for health insurance and services offered by us, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weak U.S. economy, including as a result of disruptions in the global financial markets or a decrease in general consumer confidence, could adversely impact our operating results. Consumers may attempt to reduce expenses by cancelling existing health insurance purchased through us, determine not to purchase new health insurance through us, or purchase health insurance plans for which we receive lower commissions. To the extent the economy or other factors adversely impact our membership retention or the number or type of health insurance applications submitted through us and that are approved by health insurance carriers, our rate of growth will decline and our business and operating results will be harmed. A continuing negative economic environment could also adversely impact the health insurance carriers whose plans are offered on our ecommerce platform, and they may determine to reduce their commission rates or take other actions that would negatively impact our sale of health insurance as well as our sponsorship and technology licensing businesses.\nThere are many risks associated with our operations in China.\nA portion of our operations is conducted in China. Among other things, we use employees in China to maintain and update our ecommerce platform. This and other information is delivered to us through secured communications over the Internet. Our business would be harmed if this connection temporarily failed, and we were prevented from promptly updating our software or implementing other changes to our database and systems. From time-to-time we receive inquiries from health insurance carriers relating to our operations in China and the security measures we have implemented to protect data that our employees in China may be able to access. As a part of these inquiries, we have implemented additional security measures relating to our operations in China. We may be required to implement further security measures to continue aspects of our operations in China, which could be time consuming and expensive and harm our operating results and financial condition. If we are required to move aspects of our operations from China to our offices in the United States as a result of inquiries from health insurance carriers or for other reasons, it could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Our operations in China also expose us to different and unfamiliar laws, rules and regulations, including different intellectual\nproperty laws, which are not as protective of our intellectual property as the laws in the United States, and different labor and tax laws. United States and Chinese trade laws may impose restrictions on the importation of programming or technology to or from the United States. Additionally, we have recently experienced greater competition for qualified personnel in China, which has raised market salaries and increased our compensation costs related to employees in China. If competition for personnel increases further, our compensation expenses could rise considerably or, if we determine to not increase compensation levels, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in China may be impaired, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. These risks could cause us to incur increased expenses and could harm our ability to effectively and successfully manage our operations in China, which in turn could cause our business, operating results and financial condition to suffer.\nOur sponsorship and advertising business may not be successful.\nWe sell advertising space to health insurance carriers on our website through our sponsorship and advertising program. Our sponsorship and advertising program allows carriers to purchase advertising space in specific markets in a sponsorship area on our website. Health insurance carriers have generally determined not to spend on individual and family health insurance advertising through our sponsorship and advertising program as a result of the impact of health care reform on the profitability of their individual and family health insurance businesses. To the extent that economic conditions, health care reform or other factors impact the amount health insurance carriers are willing to pay for advertising on our ecommerce platform, our sponsorship and advertising program will be adversely impacted. Since much of our sponsorship revenue depends upon the number of applications we submit to health insurance carriers, a reduction in demand for the carrier\u2019s product (such as outside open enrollment periods) would reduce our sponsorship revenue and our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. The success of our sponsorship and advertising program depends on a number of other factors, including the effectiveness of the sponsorship and advertising program as a cost-effective method for carriers to obtain additional members, consumer and health insurance carrier adoption of the Internet and our ecommerce platform as a medium for the purchase and sale of health insurance, our ability to attract consumers visiting our ecommerce platform and convert those consumers into members, the existence of a relationship between us and a diverse group of carriers that offer a number of health insurance plans in the markets in which we attempt to sell advertising, the cost, benefit and brand recognition of the health insurance plan that is the subject of the advertising, the impact the advertising has on the sale of the health insurance plan that is the subject of the advertising and the effectiveness of the carrier\u2019s other means of advertising. In addition, while our practice of selling advertising is described on our ecommerce platform, it could cause consumers to perceive us as not objective, which could harm our brand and result in a decline in our health insurance sales. It also could adversely impact our relationship with health insurance carriers that do not purchase our advertising. As a result, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe also develop, host and maintain carrier dedicated Medicare plan websites through our advertising program. Our success in doing so is dependent upon the same factors that could impact our sponsorship program. In addition, since we maintain relationships with a limited number of health insurance carriers to sell their Medicare plans, our Medicare plan-related advertising revenue is concentrated in a small number of health insurance carriers and our ability to generate Medicare plan-related advertising revenue would be harmed by the termination or non-renewal of any of these relationships as well as by a reduction in the amount a health insurance carrier is willing to pay for these services. Moreover, in light of the regulations applicable to the marketing and sale of Medicare plans, and given that these regulations are often unclear, change frequently and are subject to changing interpretations, we may in the future not be permitted to sell Medicare plan-related advertising. If we are not successful in generating Medicare plan-related advertising revenue, our business operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm our business and operating results.\nWe believe that our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business and that our technology infrastructure currently gives us a competitive advantage in the distribution of individual and family and small business health insurance. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in the United States. We have not filed for protection of our intellectual property in any foreign jurisdiction other than China. We have Chinese-registered computer software copyrights for an internally-developed software system and a project management tool and have certain trademarks in China. We have not filed any patent applications in China. The efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective, and our trademarks, copyrights and patents if issued, may be held invalid or unenforceable. Moreover, the law relating to intellectual property is not as developed in China, and our intellectual property rights may not be as respected in China as they are in the United States. Any United States or other patents issued to us may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies, and given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to seek patent protection for\ncertain of our proprietary technologies. We may not be effective in policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property, trade secrets and other confidential information, and even if we do detect violations, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. Any enforcement efforts we undertake, including litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive, could divert our management\u2019s attention and may result in a court determining that our intellectual property or other rights are unenforceable. If we are not successful in cost-effectively protecting our intellectual property rights, trade secrets and confidential information, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe may in the future be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.\nThere are a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets applicable to the internet and technology industries and entities frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received, and may in the future receive, notices that claim we have misappropriated, infringed or misused other parties\u2019 intellectual property rights, and, to the extent we gain greater visibility, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims. There may be third-party intellectual property rights, including issued or pending patents that cover significant aspects of our technologies or business methods or that cover third-party technology that we use as a part of our websites. Any intellectual property claim against us, with or without merit, could be time consuming, expensive to settle or litigate and could divert our management\u2019s attention and other resources. These claims also could subject us to significant liability for damages and could result in our having to stop using technology found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights. We might be required to seek a license for third-party intellectual property, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Even if a license is available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase our operating expenses. We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense. If we cannot license or develop technology for any infringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit our services and may be unable to compete effectively. Any of these results would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAny legal liability, regulatory penalties, or negative publicity for the information on our website or that we otherwise distribute or provide could harm our business and operating results.\nWe provide information on our website, through our customer care centers and in other ways regarding health insurance in general and the health insurance plans we market and sell, including information relating to insurance premiums, coverage, benefits, provider networks, exclusions, limitations, availability, plan comparisons and insurance company ratings. A significant amount of both automated and manual effort is required to maintain the considerable amount of insurance plan information on our website. Separately, from time to time, we use the information provided on our website and otherwise collected by us to publish reports designed to educate consumers, facilitate public debate, and facilitate reform at the state and federal level. If the information we provide on our website, through our customer care centers or otherwise is not accurate or is construed as misleading, or if we do not properly assist individuals and businesses in purchasing health insurance, members, health insurance carriers and others could attempt to hold us liable for damages, our relationships with health insurance carriers could be terminated and regulators could attempt to subject us to penalties, revoke our licenses to transact health insurance business in a particular jurisdiction, and/or compromise the status of our licenses to transact health insurance business in other jurisdictions, which could result in our loss of our commission revenue. In the ordinary course of operating our business, we have received complaints that the information we provided was not accurate or was misleading. Although in the past we have resolved these complaints without significant financial cost, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future. In addition, these types of claims could be time-consuming and expensive to defend, could divert our management\u2019s attention and other resources, and could cause a loss of confidence in our services. As a result, whether or not we are able to successfully resolve these claims, they could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we have received and may continue to receive inquiries from state regulators relating to various matters. We have become, and may in the future become, involved in litigation in the ordinary course of our business. If we are found to have violated laws or regulations, we could lose our relationship with health insurance carriers and be subject to various fines and penalties, including revocation of our licenses to sell insurance which would in turn potentially cause us to lose our commission revenue, and our business, operating results and financial condition would be materially harmed.\nAcquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may decide to acquire businesses, products and technologies. Our ability as an organization to successfully make and integrate acquisitions is unproven. Acquisitions could require significant capital infusions and could involve many risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nan acquisition may negatively impact our results of operations because it will require us to incur transaction expenses, and after the transaction, may require us to incur charges and substantial debt or liabilities, may require the amortization, write down or impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation, goodwill and other intangible assets, or may cause adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges;\n\u2022\nan acquisition undertaken for strategic business purposes may negatively impact our results of operations;\n\u2022\nwe may encounter difficulties in assimilating and integrating the business, technologies, products, personnel or operations of companies that we acquire, particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us;\n\u2022\nan acquisition may disrupt our ongoing business, divert resources, increase our expenses and distract our management;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to implement or improve internal controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at a business that prior to the acquisition lacked these controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\nthe acquired businesses, products or technologies may not generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs or to maintain our financial results;\n\u2022\nwe may have to issue equity securities to complete an acquisition, which would dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nacquisitions may involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to identify or consummate any future acquisition on favorable terms, or at all. If we do pursue an acquisition, it is possible that we may not realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition or that the financial markets or investors will negatively view the acquisition. Even if we successfully complete an acquisition, it could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements could be impaired, which could adversely affect our operating results, our ability to operate our business and our stock price.\nWe have a complex business organization. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to help ensure that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently and is complicated by the expansion of our business operations. Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors or all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Over time, controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may occur. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. We cannot assure that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, cause us to fail to timely meet our periodic reporting obligations, or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding disclosure controls and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules promulgated thereunder. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, cause us to fail to timely meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our stock price and potential lawsuits against us.\nChanges in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our results.\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings differing materially from our projections, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, expiration of or lapses in the research and development tax credit laws, tax effects of share-based compensation, outcomes as a result of tax examinations or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, including accounting for uncertain tax positions, or interpretations thereof. The related domestic deferred tax assets remain available for use in future periods and will reduce our tax provision if taxable income is generated. To the extent that our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility or adverse outcomes as a result of tax examinations, our operating results could be harmed.\nSignificant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) relating to accounting for income taxes. In addition, U.S. GAAP applies to all income tax positions, including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes, which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paid-in capital. In addition, we are subject to examinations of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There may be exposure that the outcomes from these examinations will have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nRegulation of the sale of health insurance is subject to change, and future regulations could harm our business and operating results.\nThe laws and regulations governing the offer, sale and purchase of health insurance are subject to change, and future changes may be adverse to our business. For example, a long standing provision in each state\u2019s law that we believe is advantageous to our business is that once health insurance premiums are set by the carrier and approved by state regulators, they are fixed and not generally subject to negotiation or discounting by insurance companies or agents. Additionally, state regulations generally prohibit carriers, agents and brokers from providing financial incentives, such as rebates, to their members in connection with the sale of health insurance. As a result, we do not currently compete with carriers or other agents and brokers on the price of the health insurance plans offered on our website. If these regulations change, we could be forced to reduce prices or provide rebates or other incentives for the health insurance plans sold through our ecommerce platform, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nStates have, and will continue, to adopt new laws and regulations in response to health care reform legislation. It is difficult to predict how these new laws and regulations will impact our business, but in some cases such laws and regulations could amplify the adverse impacts of health care reform, or states may adopt new requirements that adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are also subject to additional insurance regulatory risks, because we use the Internet as a distribution platform. In many cases, it is not clear how existing insurance laws and regulations apply to Internet-related health insurance advertisements and transactions. To the extent that new laws or regulations are adopted that conflict with the way we conduct our business, or to the extent that existing laws and regulations are interpreted adversely to us, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nIf we fail to comply with the numerous state laws and regulations that are applicable to the sale of health insurance, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nThe sale of health insurance is heavily regulated by each state in the United States. For instance, in addition to the impact and changes in regulations resulting from health care reform, state regulators require us to maintain a valid license in each state in which we transact health insurance business and further require that we adhere to sales, documentation and administration practices specific to that state. In addition, each employee who transacts health insurance business on our behalf must maintain a valid license in one or more states. Because we do business in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, compliance with health insurance-related laws, rules and regulations is difficult and imposes significant costs on our business. Each jurisdiction\u2019s insurance department typically has the power, among other things, to:\n\u2022\ngrant and revoke licenses to transact insurance business;\n\u2022\nconduct inquiries into the insurance-related activities and conduct of agents and agencies;\n\u2022\nrequire and regulate disclosure in connection with the sale and solicitation of health insurance;\n\u2022\nauthorize how, by which personnel and under what circumstances insurance premiums can be quoted and published and an insurance policy sold;\n\u2022\napprove which entities can be paid commissions from carriers and the circumstances under which they may be paid;\n\u2022\nregulate the content of insurance-related advertisements, including web pages, and other marketing practices;\n\u2022\napprove policy forms, require specific benefits and benefit levels and regulate premium rates;\n\u2022\nimpose fines and other penalties; and\n\u2022\nimpose continuing education requirements.\nDue to the complexity, periodic modification and differing interpretations of insurance laws and regulations, we may not have always been, and we may not always be, in compliance with them. New insurance laws, regulations and guidelines also may not be compatible with the sale of health insurance over the Internet or with various aspects of our platform or manner of marketing or selling health insurance plans. Failure to comply with insurance laws, regulations and guidelines or other laws and regulations applicable to our business could result in significant liability, additional department of insurance licensing requirements, the revocation of licenses in a particular jurisdiction and/or our inability to sell health insurance plans, which could significantly increase our operating expenses, result in the loss of our commission revenue and otherwise harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Moreover, an adverse regulatory action in one jurisdiction could result in penalties and adversely affect our license status or reputation in other jurisdictions due to the requirement that adverse regulatory actions in one jurisdiction be reported to other jurisdictions. Even if the allegations in any regulatory or other action against us are proven false, any surrounding negative publicity could harm consumer, marketing partner or health insurance carrier confidence in us, which could significantly damage our brand. Changes in insurance laws, regulations and guidelines may also be incompatible with various aspects of our business and require that we make significant modifications to our existing technology or practices, which may be costly and time-consuming to implement and could also harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, we have received, and may in the future receive, inquiries from regulators regarding our marketing and business practices. We typically respond by explaining how we believe we are in compliance with relevant regulations or may modify our practices in connection with the inquiry. Any modification of our marketing or business practices in response to future regulatory inquiries could harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\nOur business is subject to security risks and, if we are unable to safeguard the security and privacy of confidential data, including personal health information, our business will be harmed.\nOur services involve the collection and storage of confidential information of consumers and the transmission of this information to their chosen health insurance carriers and to government. For example, we collect names, addresses, Social Security and credit card numbers, and information regarding the medical history of consumers. As a result, we are subject to various laws and regulations regarding the collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information. We cannot guarantee that our facilities and systems, and those of our third party service providers, will be free of security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Compliance with privacy and security laws, requirements and regulations may result in cost increases due to new constraints on our business, the development of new processes, the effects of potential non-compliance by us or third party service providers, and enforcement actions. We may be required to expend significant amounts and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches. Despite our implementation of security measures, techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Additionally, our third party service providers may cause security breaches for which we are responsible.\nAny compromise or perceived compromise of our security by us or by one of our vendors could damage our reputation, cause the termination of relationships with government-run health insurance exchanges and our members, marketing partners and health insurance carriers, reduce demand for our services and subject us to significant liability and expense as well as regulatory action and lawsuits, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, in the event that additional data security laws are implemented, or our health insurance carrier or other partners determine to impose\nrequirements on us relating to data security, we may not be able to timely comply with such requirements or such requirements may not be compatible with our current processes. Changing our processes could be time consuming and expensive, and failure to timely implement required changes could result in our inability to sell health insurance plans in a particular jurisdiction or for a particular health insurance carrier or subject us to liability for non-compliance, any of which would damage our business, operating results and financial condition. For instance, health insurance carriers may require us to be compliant with Payment Card Industry, or PCI, security standards in order to accept credit card information from consumers. PCI compliance is generally assessed on an annual basis, and we may not always be compliant with PCI standards. If we are not in compliance with PCI standards, we may not be able to accept credit card information from consumers and our relationship with health insurance carriers could be adversely impacted or terminated, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet could adversely affect our business.\nThe laws governing general commerce on the Internet remain unsettled and it may take years to fully determine whether and how existing laws such as those governing intellectual property, privacy and taxation apply to the Internet. In addition, the growth and development of the market for electronic commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business over the Internet. Any new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations relating to the Internet could harm our business and we could be forced to incur substantial costs in order to comply with them, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business could be harmed if we are unable to correspond with our consumers or market the availability of our ecommerce platform by email.\nWe use email to market our services to potential members and as the primary means of communicating with our existing members. The laws and regulations governing the use of email for marketing purposes continue to evolve and the growth and development of the market for commerce over the Internet may lead to the adoption of additional laws. If new laws or regulations are adopted, or existing laws and regulations are interpreted, to impose additional restrictions on our ability to send email to our members or potential members, we may not be able to communicate with them in a cost-effective manner. In addition to legal restrictions on the use of email, Internet service providers, e-mail service providers and others attempt to block the transmission of unsolicited email, commonly known as \u201cspam.\u201d Many Internet and e-mail service providers have relationships with organizations whose purpose it is to detect and notify the Internet and e-mail service providers of entities that the organization believes is sending unsolicited e-mail. If an Internet or e-mail service provider identifies email from us as \u201cspam\u201d as a result of reports from these organizations or otherwise, we can be placed on a restricted list that will block our email to members or potential members. If we are unable to communicate by email with our members and potential members as a result of legislation, blockage or otherwise, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nConsumers depend upon third-party service providers to access our website, and our business and operating results could be harmed as a result of technical difficulties experienced by these service providers.\nConsumers using our website depend upon Internet, online and other service providers for access to our website. Many of these service providers have experienced significant outages, delays and other difficulties in the past and could experience them in the future. Any significant interruption in access to our website or increase in our website\u2019s response time as a result of these difficulties could damage our relationship with insurance carriers, marketing partners and existing and potential members and could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations and volatility, and our stockholders may be unable to resell their shares at a profit.\nThe stock markets, in general, and the markets for high technology stocks in particular, have historically experienced high levels of volatility. The market for technology stocks has been extremely volatile and frequently reaches levels that bear no relationship to the past or present operating performance of those companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the trading price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate or decline, particularly as a result of developments relating to health care reform legislation and the implementation of health care reform. Other factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of technology companies in general, and companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in the expectations of investors or securities analysts, including changes in financial estimates or investment recommendations by securities analysts who follow our business and changes in perceptions relating to the economy;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances or introduction of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated developments in our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated legal or regulatory developments in the United States or foreign countries, including health care reform legislation in the United States;\n\u2022\nmajor catastrophic events;\n\u2022\nannouncements or developments relating to the economy;\n\u2022\nour sale of common stock or other securities in the future;\n\u2022\nthe trading volume of our common stock, as well as sales of large blocks of our stock; or\n\u2022\ndepartures of key personnel.\nThese factors, as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions, or any difficulties associated with such transactions, by us or our strategic partners, customers or our current competitors, may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company. Such litigation could result in substantial cost and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources. In addition, volatility, lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program, including our equity incentive program, may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees.\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.\nFrom time to time, we have released, and may continue to release guidance in earnings conference calls, earnings releases, or otherwise, regarding our future performance that represents our management's estimates as of the date of release. This guidance, which includes forward-looking statements, has been and will be based on projections prepared by our management. These projections are not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our registered public accountants nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the projections. Accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to the projections.\nProjections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We may state possible outcomes as high and low ranges. Any range we provide is not intended to imply that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors and we may decide to suspend guidance at any time. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such third parties.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Our actual results have, and may in the future, vary from our guidance and the variations may be material. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our common stock.\nAny failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could result in the actual operating results being different from our guidance, and the differences may be adverse and material.\nA limited number of stockholders have the ability to influence the outcome of director elections and other matters requiring stockholder approval.\nA small number of stockholders and their affiliated entities beneficially owned more than 50% percent of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2016. These stockholders, if they act together, could exert substantial influence over matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors, the amendment of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. This concentration of ownership may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their stock as part of a sale of our company and might reduce our stock price. These actions may be taken even if they are opposed by other stockholders.\nCertain provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\ncumulative voting in the election of directors is prohibited, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to determine to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer or the board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nWe are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law. Under Delaware law, a corporation may, in general, not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction.", "PERMNO": 91498, "SIC": 6411, "TIC": "EHTH"}
