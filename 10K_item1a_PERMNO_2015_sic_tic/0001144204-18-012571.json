The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Corporation are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Corporation. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the Corporation\u2019s business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Corporation\u2019s Business\nThe Corporation is Subject to Interest Rate Risk\nThe Corporation\u2019s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Corporation\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest the Corporation receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) the Corporation\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of the Corporation\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average duration of the Corporation\u2019s mortgage-backed securities portfolio. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, the Corporation\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings.\nChanging interest rates may decrease our earnings and asset values.\nAlthough management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the Corporation\u2019s results of operations, any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nExpected interest rate increases could negatively affect our income, if we are not able to anticipate corresponding changes in market forces.\nThe Corporation\u2019s operating results are dependent to a significant degree on its net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from loans, investments and other interest-earning assets and interest expense on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. The interest income and interest expense of the Corporation change as the interest rates on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities change. Interest rates may change because of general economic conditions, the policies of various regulatory authorities and other factors beyond the Corporation\u2019s control. In a rising interest rate environment, loans tend to prepay slowly and new loans at higher rates increase slowly, while interest paid on deposits increases rapidly because the terms to maturity of deposits tend to be shorter than the terms to maturity or prepayment of loans. Such differences in the adjustment of interest rates on assets and liabilities may negatively affect the Corporation\u2019s income.\nWe are subject to credit risk related to the interest rate environment and the economic conditions of the markets in which we operate.\nThere are inherent risks associated with the Corporation\u2019s lending activities. These risks include, among other things, the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where the Corporation operates as well as those across the State of Ohio, the United States and abroad. Increases in interest rates and/or weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans. The Corporation\nis also subject to various laws and regulations that affect its lending activities. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject the Corporation to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment of significant civil monetary penalties against the Corporation.\nThe Corporation\u2019s level of non-performing loans has decreased over the past couple of years. However, an increase in non-performing loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loans losses and an increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation is subject to liquidity risk in its operations, which could adversely affect the ability to fund various obligations.\nLiquidity risk is the possibility of being unable to meet obligations as they come due, pay deposits when withdrawn, capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise, or pay dividends because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. Liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and retention, principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities, net cash provided from operation and access to other funding sources. Liquidity is essential to our business. We must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale or pledging as collateral of loans and other assets could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or regulatory action that limits or eliminates our access to alternate funding sources. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are nonspecific to us, such as severe disruption of the financial markets or negative expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole, as evidenced by recent turmoil in the domestic and worldwide credit markets.\nChanges in accounting standards could impact the Corporation\u2019s reported earnings.\nCurrent accounting and tax rules, standards, policies and interpretations influence the methods by which financial institutions conduct business and govern financial reporting and disclosures. These laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time. Events that may not have a direct impact on the Corporation, such as bankruptcy of major U.S. companies, have resulted in legislators, regulators, and authoritative bodies, such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and various taxing authorities, responding by adopting and/or proposing substantive revision to laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies and interpretations. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. The Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by a change in accounting standards.\nThe Corporation\u2019s Allowance for Loan Losses May Be Insufficient\nThe Corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, that represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable losses within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks; loan and lease loss experience; current loan and lease portfolio quality; present economic, political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan and lease portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the Corporation to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of the Corporation\u2019s control, may require a potentially significant increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the Corporation\u2019s\nallowance for loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses or the recognition of further loan and lease charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan and lease losses, the Corporation will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan and lease losses. Any increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital, and may have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nPrepayments of loans may negatively impact our business.\nGenerally, customers of the Corporation may prepay the principal amount of their outstanding loans at any time. The speed at which such prepayments occur, as well as the size of such prepayments, are within such customers\u2019 discretion. If customers prepay the principal amount of their loans, and the Corporation is unable to lend those funds to other borrowers or invest the funds at the same or higher interest rates, the Corporation\u2019s interest income will be reduced. A significant reduction in interest income could have a negative impact on the Corporation\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Corporation may face increasing pressure from historical purchasers of our residential mortgage loans to repurchase those loans or reimburse purchasers for losses related to those loans.\nThe Corporation generally sells the fixed rate long-term residential mortgage loans it originates on the secondary market and retains adjustable rate mortgage loans for its portfolios. In response to the financial crisis, the Corporation believes that purchasers of residential mortgage loans, such as government sponsored entities, are increasing their efforts to seek to require sellers of residential mortgage loans to either repurchase loans previously sold or reimburse purchasers for losses related to loans previously sold when losses are incurred on a loan previously sold due to actual or alleged failure to strictly conform to the purchaser\u2019s purchase criteria. As a result, the Corporation may face increasing pressure from historical purchasers of its residential mortgage loans to repurchase those loans or reimburse purchasers for losses related to those loans and the Corporation may face increasing expenses to defend against such claims. If the Corporation is required in the future to repurchase loans previously sold, reimburse purchasers for losses related to loans previously sold, or if the Corporation incurs increasing expenses to defend against such claims, its financial condition and results of operations would be negatively affected. Additionally, such actions would lower the Corporation\u2019s capital ratios as a result of increased assets and reduced income through expenses and any losses incurred.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act may adversely impact the Corporation\u2019s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, is complex and several of its provisions are still being implemented. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has extensive regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer financial products and services, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which has oversight authority for monitoring and regulating systemic risk. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act altered the authority and duties of the federal banking and securities regulatory agencies, implemented certain corporate governance requirements for all public companies including financial institutions with regard to executive compensation, proxy access by shareholders, and certain whistleblower provisions, and restricted certain proprietary trading and hedge fund and private equity activities of banks and their affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act also required the issuance of numerous regulations, many of which have not yet been issued. The regulations will continue to take effect over several more years, continuing to make it difficult to anticipate the overall impact.\nIf the Corporation is required to write-down goodwill and other intangible assets, its financial condition and results of operations would be negatively affected.\nA substantial portion of the value of the merger consideration paid in connection with recent acquisitions was allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets on the Corporation\u2019s consolidated balance sheet. The amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired. The Corporation is required to conduct an annual review to determine whether goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets are impaired.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually as of September 30th. An impairment test also could be triggered between annual testing dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below the carrying amount. Examples of those events or circumstances would include a significant adverse change in business climate; a significant unanticipated loss of customers or assets under management; an unanticipated loss of key personnel; a sustained period of poor investment performance; a significant loss of deposits or loans; a significant reduction in profitability; or a significant change in loan credit quality.\nThe Corporation cannot assure that it will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future. Any material impairment charge would have a negative effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial results and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nThe Corporation\u2019s Profitability Depends Significantly on Economic Conditions in the State of Ohio\nThe Corporation\u2019s success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the State of Ohio and the specific local markets in which the Corporation operates. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, the Corporation provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in the Ohio counties of Allen, Delaware, Franklin, Hancock, Putnam, Marion, Sandusky, Van Wert, and Wood. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for the Corporation\u2019s products and services as well as the ability of the Corporation\u2019s customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of the Corporation\u2019s deposit funding sources. A significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences, unemployment, changes in securities markets or other factors could impact those local economic conditions and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation Operates in a Highly Competitive Industry and Market Area\nThe Corporation faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of whom are larger and may have more financial resources. Such competitors primarily include national, regional, and community banks within the various markets the Corporation operates. The Corporation also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of the Corporation\u2019s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than the Corporation can.\nThe Corporation\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nThe ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets.\n\u2022\nThe ability to expand the Corporation\u2019s market position.\n\u2022\nThe scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands.\n\u2022\nThe rate at which the Corporation introduces new products and services relative to its competitors.\n\u2022\nCustomer satisfaction with the Corporation\u2019s level of service.\n\u2022\nIndustry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken the Corporation\u2019s competitive position, which could adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nLegislative or regulatory changes or actions could adversely impact our business\nThe financial services industry is extensively regulated. We are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of our operations. These laws and regulations are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors, borrowers, and the DIF, not to benefit our shareholders. Changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively impact us, possibly limiting the services we provide, increasing the ability of non-banks to compete with us or requiring us to change the way we operate. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on the operation of an institution and the ability to determine the adequacy of an institution\u2019s allowance for loan losses. Failure by and bank or bank holding company to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and policies could result in sanctions being imposed by the regulatory agencies, including the imposition of civil money penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nThe Corporation is subject to Environmental Liability Risk Associated with Lending Activities\nA significant portion of the Corporation\u2019s loan and lease portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, the Corporation may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, the Corporation may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require the Corporation to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit the Corporation\u2019s ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the Corporation\u2019s exposure to environmental liability. Although the Corporation may perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation\u2019s Controls and Procedures May Fail or Be Circumvented\nManagement regularly reviews and updates the Corporation\u2019s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the Corporation\u2019s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUBOH Relies On Dividends from Its Subsidiaries for Most of Its Revenue\nUBOH is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiary. It receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiary. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on UBOH common stock, interest and principal on UBOH debt, and other operating expenses. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Union Bank may pay to the UBOH. Under these law and regulations, the amount of dividends that may be paid by Union Bank in any calendar year is generally limited to the current year\u2019s net profits, combined with the retained net profits of the preceding two years. In addition, the FDIC has issued policy statements that provide that insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Thus, the ability of\nUnion Bank to pay dividends to UBOH in the future will be subject to Union Bank\u2019s ability to earn profits in the future, and the federal statutory provisions, regulations, regulatory policies, and capital guidelines which are applicable to UBOH and Union Bank. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve\u2019s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement provides, inter alia, that it is expected that dividends by a holding company will be eliminated in the event that a holding company is: (1) not reducing its debt consistent with the requirement that the debt to equity ratio be reduced to .30:1, or (2) not meeting the requirements of its loan agreement(s). Also, UBOH\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. In the event the Union Bank is unable to pay dividends to UBOH, UBOH may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on the UBOH\u2019s common stock or trust preferred securities. The inability to receive dividends from the Union Bank could have a material adverse effect on UBOH\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation May Not Be Able To Attract and Retain Skilled People\nThe Corporation\u2019s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by the Corporation can be intense and the Corporation may not be able to hire such people or to retain them. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of the Corporation\u2019s key personnel could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation\u2019s business because of their skills, knowledge of the Corporation\u2019s market, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nThe Corporation\u2019s Business could be Adversely Affected by Third-Party Service Providers, Data Breaches and Cyber-Attacks\nThe Corporation faces the risk of operational disruption, failure or capacity constraints due to its dependency on third-party vendors for components of its business infrastructure. While the Corporation has selected these third-party vendors through its vendor management processes, the Corporation does not control their operations. As such, any failure on the part of these business partners to perform their various responsibilities could also adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s business and operations.\nFurther, the Corporation may be affected by data breaches at retailers and other third parties who participate in data interchanges with the Corporation and its customers that involve the theft of customer credit and debit card data, which may include the theft of the Corporation\u2019s debit card PIN numbers and commercial card information used to make purchases at such retailers and other third parties. Such data breaches could result in the Corporation\u2019s incurring significant expenses to reissue debit cards and cover losses, which could result in a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s results of operations.\nTo date, the Corporation has not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, but there can be no assurance that the Corporation will not suffer such attacks or attempted breaches, or incur resulting losses in the future. The Corporation\u2019s risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, The Corporation\u2019s plans to continue to implement internet and mobile banking to meet customer demand, and the current economic and political environment. As cyber and other data security threats continue to evolve, the Corporation may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.\nThe Corporation\u2019s assets at risk for cyber-attacks include financial assets and non-public information belonging to customers. the Corporation utilizes several third-party vendors who have access to the Corporation\u2019s assets via electronic media. Certain cyber security risks arise due to this access, including cyber espionage, blackmail, ransom, and theft. The Corporation employs many preventive and detective controls to protect its assets, and provides mandatory recurring information security training to all employees. The Corporation maintains certain insurance coverage to prevent material financial loss from cyber-attacks.\nThe financial services industry, as well as the broader economy, may be subject to new legislation, regulation, and government policy.\nAt this time, it is difficult to predict the legislative and regulatory changes that will result from the combination of a new President of the United States and the first year since 2010 in which both Houses of Congress and the White House have majority memberships from the same political party. In recent years both the President and senior members of the House of Representatives have advocated for significant reduction of financial services regulation, to include amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act and structural changes to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The new Administration and Congress also may cause broader economic changes due to changes in governing ideology and governing style. The change in the Federal Reserve Chairperson as well as new appointments to the Board of Governors to the Federal Reserve could affect monetary policy and interest rates, and changes in fiscal policy could affect broader patterns of trade and economic growth. Future legislation, regulation, and government policy could affect the banking industry as a whole, including our business and results of operations, in ways that are difficult to predict. In addition, our results of operations also could be adversely affected by changes in the way in which existing statutes and regulations are interpreted or applied by courts and government agencies.\nThe Corporation Continually Encounters Technological Change\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Corporation\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Corporation\u2019s operations. Many of the Corporation\u2019s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Corporation may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation\u2019s business and, in turn, the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nEmergence of nonbank alternatives to the financial system.\nConsumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions. Technology and other changes, including the emergence of\u2009 \u201cFintech Companies\u201d are allowing parties to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can also complete transactions, such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDamage to the Corporation\u2019s reputation could damage its businesses.\nMaintaining trust in the Corporation is critical to our ability to attract and maintain customers, investors and employees. Damage to our reputation can therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects. Harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources, including, among others, employee misconduct, security breaches, compliance failures, litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations. Our reputation could also be harmed by the failure of an affiliate, a vendor or other third party with which we do business, to comply with laws or regulations. In addition, a failure or perceived failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality, to treat customers and clients fairly, or to handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately or in compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations can result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to our reputation. Adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media websites regarding the Corporation, whether or not true, may result in harm to the prospects. Should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine our reputation occur, there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that we\nmay need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the reputational harm could not adversely affect our earnings and results of operations, or that damage to our reputation will not impair our ability to retain our existing or attract new customers, investors and employees.\nThe Corporation Is Subject To Claims and Litigation Pertaining to Fiduciary Responsibility\nFrom time to time, customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to the Corporation\u2019s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal action related to the Corporation\u2019s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal action are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Corporation they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of the Corporation and its products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nSevere Weather, Natural Disasters, Acts of War Or Terrorism And Other External Events Could Significantly Impact The Corporation\u2019s Business\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Corporation\u2019s ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of the Corporation\u2019s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Corporation to incur additional expenses. Although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Associated with the Corporation\u2019s Industry\nThe Earnings of Financial Services Companies are significantly affected by General Business and Economic Conditions\nThe Corporation\u2019s operations and profitability are impacted by general business and economic conditions in the United States and abroad. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, money supply, political issues, legislative and regulatory changes, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, broad trends in industry and finance, and the strength of the U.S. economy and the local economies in which the Corporation operates, all of which are beyond the Corporation\u2019s control. Deterioration in economic conditions could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and non-performing assets, decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for the Corporation\u2019s products and services, among other things, any of which could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nFinancial Services Companies Depend on the Accuracy and Completeness of Information about Customers and Counterparties\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, the Corporation may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. The Corporation may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation\u2019s business and, in turn, the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nConsumers May Decide Not To Use Banks to Complete their Financial Transactions\nTechnology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 88951, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "UBOH"}
