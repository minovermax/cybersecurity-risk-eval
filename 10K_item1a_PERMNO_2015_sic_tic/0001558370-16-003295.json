Risk Factors\nRisk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements\nThe discussion set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains statements concerning potential future events. Such forward-looking statements are based on assumptions by our management, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including, without limitation, assumptions about risks and uncertainties faced by us. Readers can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of such verbs as \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cplans\u201d or similar verbs or conjugations of such verbs. If any of management\u2019s assumptions prove incorrect or should unanticipated circumstances arise, our actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements could materially differ from those anticipated by such forward-looking statements. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are those discussed below in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We will not update any forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect future events or developments.\nIf we do not successfully address the risks described below, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially adversely affected. The trading price of our Common Stock could decline because of any of these risks.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur business previously incurred net losses and may incur losses in the future.\nOur business had a history of net losses through September 30, 2010. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.5 billion, total stockholders\u2019 equity of $579.6 million, and goodwill of $314.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had net income of $86.1 million and $77.5 million of net cash provided by operating activities. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will sustain an operating profit or a positive cash flow. If we are not able to do so, the trading price of our Common Stock may fall significantly and we may not be able to meet our debt obligations, working capital requirements, capital expenditure plans, or other cash needs. Our inability to meet those needs and any decrease in the trading prices of our Common Stock could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and liquidity.\nWe believe to continue to be profitable before interest expense and to continue to generate a positive cash flow, we must maintain or increase the positive margin of our advertising and subscriber revenue over our (i) programming expenses, (ii) selling, general and administrative expenses and (iii) marketing expenses. We expect this to require, among other things, maintaining or increasing the distribution of our Networks, attracting younger viewers to our Networks, attracting more advertisers, increasing our ratings and maintaining or increasing our subscriber and advertising rates.\nWe, and our subsidiaries, each a guarantor of our 2015 Credit Agreement, may incur additional indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had total debt outstanding of $322.4 million, all of which was secured, and borrowing availability of approximately $99.1 million under our 2015 Credit Agreement.\nThe amount of our indebtedness, as well as the associated restrictive covenants, may adversely affect the operation of our business by limiting our ability to do a number of things, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nUse operating cash flow to fund future programming, to complete strategic transactions, to develop properties, for working capital and for other business activities, because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service our debt;\n\u00b7\nObtain additional financing to fund our working capital needs, acquisitions, capital expenditures or other debt service requirements or for other purposes;\n\u00b7\nCompete with other companies who are not as highly leveraged, as we may be less capable of responding to adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u00b7\nAvoid vulnerabilities if confronted with downturns in the pricing of our programming, market conditions in our industry or our customers\u2019 industries or general economic conditions.\nSubject to the restrictions in our 2015 Credit Agreement, we and our subsidiary guarantors may incur significant additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness. Although the terms of our 2015 Credit Agreement contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be significant. If we or any of our subsidiary guarantors should incur additional debt, the risks described above could increase.\nOur liquidity could be dependent on external funds.\nUnanticipated significant costs or expenses or any developments that decrease or otherwise hamper the growth in our revenue may result in the need for additional external funds in order to continue operations. There can be no assurance that external funds will be available or available under acceptable terms. In addition, any new debt financing would require the cooperation and agreement of existing lenders.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and ongoing investments in our business and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy such obligations that may not be successful.\nIn addition to our debt service obligations, our operations require substantial investments on a continuing basis. Our ability to satisfy our debt obligations and to fund capital and non-capital expenditures necessary to maintain the condition of our operating assets and properties, as well as to provide capacity for the growth of our business, will depend upon, among other things, the following:\n\u00b7\nour future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, competitive, regulatory, legal and other factors, many of which are beyond our control; and\n\u00b7\nour future ability to borrow under our 2015 Credit Agreement, the availability of which depends on, among other things, our complying with the covenants in the 2015 Credit Agreement.\nWe cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that we will be able to draw under our 2015 Credit Agreement in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to service our indebtedness or other capital needs, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not be adequate to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or other capital needs. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. If we are required to dispose of material assets or operations, sell equity, or negotiate with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt, in order to meet our debt service and other obligations, our liquidity would be diminished which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, we may not be able to consummate those dispositions for fair market value or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur 2015 Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us which, among other things, limit our ability to do the following:\n\u00b7\nincur additional debt;\n\u00b7\npay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u00b7\nmake certain payments on debt that is subordinated or secured on a junior basis;\n\u00b7\nmake certain investments;\n\u00b7\nsell certain assets;\n\u00b7\ncreate liens on certain assets;\n\u00b7\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u00b7\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates;\n\u00b7\nenter into new unrelated lines of business;\n\u00b7\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions; and\n\u00b7\nconsolidate, merge, liquidate or dissolve any unrestricted subsidiaries.\nAlso, the 2015 Credit Agreement requires us to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants, including a requirement to maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement) of less than 4.50 to 1.00 and a Consolidated Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement) of less than 3.00 to 1.00. Our ability to comply with these financial covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and, as a result, we may be unable to meet these financial covenants. Any of the foregoing restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions and could otherwise restrict corporate activities. Any failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under our 2015 Credit Agreement. Upon a default, unless waived or cured, the lenders under our 2015 Credit Agreement could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans, foreclose on our assets pledged to such lenders to secure our obligations under the 2015 Credit Agreement and force us into bankruptcy or liquidation as more fully described under the heading \u201cIf we default on our obligations to pay our indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on other indebtedness\u201d below.\nIf we default on our obligations to pay our indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on our other indebtedness.\nIf our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to seek waivers from the required lenders under our 2015 Credit Agreement to avoid being in default. We cannot assure that such waivers will be granted or that we will otherwise be able to avoid a default. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, or interest on such indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the instruments governing our indebtedness, including our 2015 Credit Agreement, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all of the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with any accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under our 2015 Credit Agreement could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans, foreclose on our assets pledged to such lenders to secure our obligations under the 2015 Credit Agreement, in each case, which could force us into voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or cause us to discontinue operations or seek a purchaser of our business or assets. In addition, a default under our 2015 Credit Agreement would trigger a cross default under our other agreements and could trigger a cross default under any agreements governing our future indebtedness.\n\u201cMost Favored Nations\u201d provisions may require modification of existing distribution agreements which could adversely affect subscriber revenue.\nA number of our existing distribution agreements contain \u201cmost favored nations\u201d or \u201cMFN\u201d clauses. These clauses typically provide that, in the event we enter into an agreement with another distributor on more favorable terms, these terms must be offered to the distributor holding the MFN right, subject to certain exceptions and conditions. These clauses cover matters such as subscriber fees, launch support, local advertising time and other financial and operating provisions. In the past, after entering into new distribution agreements, we have been asked by some of the distributors holding MFN rights to modify their distribution agreements to incorporate financial and other terms similar to those in the new agreements. Any claims of this type in the future could result in lower overall subscriber revenue or cash outlays; however, if our subscription base is increased as a result of such modifications, it could result in overall higher advertising revenue.\nIf we are unable to obtain programming from third parties, we may be unable to increase our subscriber base.\nProgramming acquired from third parties is an important component of our business. We compete with other pay television network providers to acquire programming. If we fail to obtain programming on reasonable terms for any reason, including as a result of competition, we could be forced to incur additional costs to acquire such programming or look for alternative programming, which may decrease our subscriber base or hinder the growth of our subscriber base.\nIf our programming declines in popularity, our subscriber fees and advertising revenue could fall.\nOur success depends partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control, such as viewer preferences, competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities. We may not be able to anticipate and react effectively to shifts in tastes and interests in our markets. For example, we continue to strive to meet the preferences of our target audience demographic. Our competitors may have greater numbers of original productions, better distribution, and greater capital resources, and may be able to react more quickly to shifts in consumer tastes and interests. As a result, we may be unable to maintain the commercial success of any of our current programming, or to generate sufficient demand and market acceptance for our new programming. A shift in viewer preferences in programming or alternative entertainment activities could also cause a decline in both advertising and subscriber fees revenue. The decline in revenue could hinder or prevent us from achieving profitability or maintaining a positive cash flow and could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nIn addition, our delivery of the Networks continues to be impacted by industry developments. One potentially significant factor is the continued growth of time-shifting digital video recording devices (\u201cDVRs\u201d). DVRs heighten the impact of competition as viewers are able to increase their access to their preferred content. The use of DVRs and other technologies that allow viewers to fast-forward or skip programming, including commercials, have caused changes in viewer behavior that may affect the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers and could, therefore, negatively affect our revenues. If our distribution methods and content are not responsive to our target audience, our business could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to increase our advertising revenue, we may be unable to achieve improved results.\nIf we fail to significantly increase our advertising revenue, we may be unable to achieve or sustain improved results or to expand our business. A failure to increase advertising revenue may be a result of any or all of the following, among other factors: (i) a decline in viewer ratings; (ii) uncertainty caused by the current economic environment regarding the condition of the advertising marketplace and the financial health of many industry segments and individual companies, including those which advertise on our Networks; (iii) inability to reduce our average viewer age to be within our target audience; (iv) inability to identify, attract and retain experienced sales and marketing personnel with relevant experience; (v) inability to successfully compete against the significantly more extensive and well-funded sales and marketing operations of our current or future competitors; (vi) shift in expenditures by advertisers triggered by advancement of new technologies; and (vii) inability to increase our advertising sales rates or obligation to run additional advertising spots to fulfill guaranteed delivery numbers which affect the availability of advertising inventory for future sales. Success in increasing our advertising revenue also depends upon the number and coverage of the distributors who carry our Networks and our number of subscribers.\nFailure to renew our long-term distribution agreements, or renewal on less favorable terms, the termination of those agreements or consolidation of our distributors, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCurrently our major distribution agreements have terms which expire at various times from September 2017 through December 2032. Failure to renew these distribution agreements, or renewal on less favorable terms, or the termination of those agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. A reduced distribution of our Networks would adversely affect our subscriber fee revenue, and impact our ability to sell advertising or the rates we charge for such advertising. Even if our distributor agreements are renewed, we cannot assure that the renewal rates will equal or exceed the rates that we currently charge these distributors.\nIn some cases, if a distributor is acquired, the distribution agreement of the acquiring distributor will govern following the acquisition. In those circumstances, the acquisition of a distributor that is party to one or more distributor agreements with our Networks on terms that are more favorable to us could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The cable and satellite distributors have undergone a period of consolidation over approximately the past ten years that has resulted in fewer distributors of content. This consolidation among cable and satellite operators has given the largest operators in the industry, including AT&T since it recently acquired DIRECTV, considerable leverage in their relationships with programmers, including us. As a result of this industry consolidation, we face increasing pressure to lower the rates we charge distributors or may face reduced distribution of our Networks. The\nmajority of our subscriber revenues come from a handful of our largest distributors. Approximately 75% of our subscriber revenues were from our four largest distributors for the year ended December 31, 2015. Continued consolidation within the industry could further reduce the number of distributors available to carry our content and increase the negotiating leverage of our distributors which could adversely affect our revenue.\nHallmark Cards controls us and this control could create conflicts of interest or inhibit potential changes of control.\nHallmark Cards, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, HCC and Hallmark Cards GmbH, beneficially owns an aggregate of approximately 90.3% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock. This control gives Hallmark Cards and its subsidiaries substantial influence over us and on matters requiring approval from our stockholders, including the election of our directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation and the approval of significant transactions. Furthermore, others may be discouraged from initiating potential merger, takeover or other change of control transactions that may otherwise be beneficial to our business or holders of our Common Stock. As a result, the market price of our Common Stock could suffer, and our business could suffer. In addition, the control that Hallmark Cards or these specific wholly-owned affiliates may exert over us, either directly or indirectly, could give rise to conflicts of interest in certain situations, including, without limitation:\n\u00b7\nconflicts between Hallmark Cards, as our controlling stockholder, and our other stockholders, whose interests may differ with respect to, among other things, our strategic direction or significant corporate transactions;\n\u00b7\nconflicts related to corporate opportunities that could be pursued by us, on the one hand, or by Hallmark Cards or its other affiliates, on the other hand; or\n\u00b7\nconflicts related to existing or new contractual relationships between us, on the one hand, and Hallmark Cards and its affiliates, on the other hand.\nIn addition, our directors also may be officers or directors of Hallmark Cards or its affiliates, which may create, or create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when those directors are allocating time between the companies and when they are faced with decisions that could have different implications for Hallmark Cards, including its affiliates, and us. Such directors have fiduciary duties, including duties of loyalty, to both companies.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that Hallmark Cards will have no duty to refrain from engaging in activities or lines of business that are the same as or similar to the activities or lines of business in which we engage, and neither Hallmark Cards nor any officer or director of Hallmark Cards, except as described under \u201cImpact of Related Party Agreements-Certain Business Relationships and Conflicts of Interest\u201d below, will be liable to us or to our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of any such activities of Hallmark Cards. In the event that Hallmark Cards acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for both Hallmark Cards and us, Hallmark Cards will have no duty to communicate or offer that corporate opportunity to us and will not be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty as a stockholder by reason of the fact that Hallmark Cards pursues or acquires that corporate opportunity for itself, directs that corporate opportunity to another person, or does not communicate information regarding that corporate opportunity to us.\nHallmark Cards\u2019 standstill restrictions placed on ownership of our Common Stock pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement expired on December 31, 2013. Consequently, Hallmark Cards is now allowed to pursue certain transactions related to the sale and disposition of our Common Stock that it was previously prohibited from pursuing under certain conditions. On June 24, 2013, Hallmark Cards filed a Schedule 13D/A disclosing possible options it may consider with respect to its ownership of our Common Stock upon expiration of the standstill restriction, which included among other things: maintaining their investment in us; purchasing additional shares of our Common Stock, either on the market or in privately negotiated transactions; engaging in a short-form merger to eliminate our minority stockholders or proposing another form of \u201cgoing private\u201d transaction; proposing that our Board of Directors consider implementing a stock repurchase program; proposing that our Board of Directors consider delisting our Common Stock from the Nasdaq Global Market and terminating our registration under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; and disposing, subject to the continuing limitations in the Stockholders Agreement, all or a portion of their investment in the Company in a privately negotiated transaction or series of transactions. Should Hallmark Cards pursue any of the preceding options, the market for and price of our Common Stock could suffer, and our business could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to protect or maintain intellectual property rights upon which our business relies, and if we lose intellectual property protection or lose the right to use the name \u201cHallmark,\u201d our business could be materially harmed.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property. We attempt to protect these intellectual property rights through a combination of our copyright, trade secret, and trademark law and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements. We also depend on our trade names and domain names. We have filed trademarks and other intellectual property registrations. Even if such registrations are issued, they may not fully protect important aspects of our business and there is no guarantee that our business does not or will not infringe upon intellectual property rights of others. Furthermore, intellectual property laws vary from country to country, and it may be more difficult to protect and enforce our intellectual property in some foreign jurisdictions. In addition, piracy, which encompasses the theft of our signal, and unauthorized use of our content in the digital environment continues to present a threat to our revenues. As a result, it may be possible, for unauthorized third parties to copy and distribute our productions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, in the future, we may need to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any such litigation could affect our cash flows and divert the attention of our management.\nPursuant to license agreements, we license the name \u201cHallmark\u201d from Hallmark Licensing, LLC, a subsidiary of Hallmark Cards, for use in the names of our Networks. In conjunction with the 2015 Credit Agreement, Hallmark Licensing, LLC, extended the term of the license agreements for an additional period that terminates on the earlier of (i) June 30, 2021 or (ii) the payment in full of all obligations and terminations of all commitments. We believe that the use of this trademark is critical for our Networks due to the substantial name recognition and favorable characteristics associated with the name in the United States. Should these licenses expire without renewal or if otherwise become unavailable to us, our business could be materially harmed.\nDespite Hallmark Licensing, LLC\u2019s efforts to protect its trademark in the name \u201cHallmark,\u201d third parties may infringe or misappropriate the name \u201cHallmark,\u201d which could harm our business and cause us to divert time and resources to litigate to enforce our rights. Further, in the event of bankruptcy proceedings relating to Hallmark Licensing, LLC or Hallmark Cards, a bankruptcy court could conclude that the license agreements are executory contracts and, subject to certain legal requirements, the bankruptcy trustee may either assume or reject the license agreements. Rejection of the license agreements could prevent us from continuing to use the \u201cHallmark\u201d name. The loss of our license rights to use the name \u201cHallmark\u201d could substantially harm our business.\nOthers may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us.\nOthers may claim that our productions or production techniques misappropriate or infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. Regardless of whether such claims are valid or successful, we could incur significant costs and diversion of time and resources in defending against such claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, cash flows and results of operations.\nIf our Federal Tax Deconsolidation is challenged, we could be obligated to reimburse Hallmark Cards for substantial tax payments.\nThe Federal Tax Deconsolidation had a significant impact on our cash flows. Amounts previously budgeted for cash payments for taxable amounts due under the Tax Sharing Agreement (as defined below) have been used for the pay down of debt and other uses. Under the terms of the Federal Tax Deconsolidation, however, we agreed that if any taxing authority determines that the Federal Tax Deconsolidation did not result in us no longer being a member of the Hallmark Cards\u2019 consolidated federal tax group, then the Tax Sharing Agreement will be deemed to have been continuously in effect. If, in the future, the Tax Sharing Agreement is deemed to have been continuously in effect, we would not be permitted to access its NOLs and could be obligated to reimburse substantial tax payments to Hallmark Cards, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.\nIf our third-party suppliers fail to provide us with network infrastructure services on a timely basis, our costs could increase and our growth could be hindered.\nWe currently rely on third parties to supply key network infrastructure services, including uplink, playback, transmission and satellite services to our market, which are available only from limited sources. We have occasionally experienced outages, delays and other problems in receiving communications equipment, services and facilities and may, in the future, be unable to obtain such services, equipment or facilities on the scale and within the time frames required\nby us on terms we find acceptable, or at all. If we are unable to obtain, or if we experience a delay in the delivery of, such services, we may be forced to incur significant unanticipated expenses to secure alternative third party suppliers or adjust our operations, which could hinder our growth and reduce our revenue and potential profitability. Additionally, if we experience a failure of AMC 11, the satellite currently transmitting our channels, our channels would be moved to another satellite operated by our current satellite provider, which transition would require a reacquisition by our distributors.\nIf we are unable to retain key executives and other personnel, our growth could be inhibited and our business harmed.\nWe believe our success depends on the expertise and continued service of our executive officers and key employees of our subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that these employees will remain with us or our subsidiaries. If we fail to attract, hire or retain the necessary personnel, we may be unable to implement our business plan or keep pace with developing trends in our industry.\nThe seasonality of our business could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations.\nOur advertising revenues are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Typically, our advertising rates, and, in turn, advertising revenues are highest during the fourth quarter. While advertising revenue, net of agency commissions, is recognized in the period in which related commercial spots or long form programming are aired, we typically commit approximately 40% of our Networks\u2019 advertising in the Upfront Season. In addition, advertising rates also vary by time of year due to seasonal changes in television viewership. Due to the seasonality of our business, if a short term negative impact on our business occurs during the time of high seasonal demand, the effect could have a disproportionate effect on the results of our business for the year.\nThe amount of our goodwill may hinder our ability to achieve profitability.\nAs a result of our acquisitions of all the common interests in Crown Media United States, we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill. We are required to periodically review whether the value of our goodwill has been impaired. If we are required to write down our goodwill, our results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity could be materially adversely affected.\nOur stock price may be volatile and could decline substantially.\nThe stock market and the market price for our Common Stock has, from time to time, experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Many factors may cause the market price for our Common Stock to decline, including the following:\n\u00b7\nfailure of our operating results to meet the expectations of investors in any quarter;\n\u00b7\neconomic conditions that adversely affect our advertising rates or our number of subscribers;\n\u00b7\nmaterial announcements by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\ngovernmental regulatory action;\n\u00b7\ntechnological innovations by competitors or competing technologies;\n\u00b7\nperceptions by the investing community or our customers with respect to the prospects of our company or our industry;\n\u00b7\nchanges in general market conditions or economic trends; and\n\u00b7\nfailure by us to renew major distribution agreements.\nAdditionally, of the approximately 359.7 million outstanding shares of our Common Stock, only 34.8 million shares (approximately 9.7%), are held by non-affiliates. The ownership of our Common Stock may also be a cause of volatility in the market price of our Common Stock.\nOur use of certain hedging techniques may expose us to counterparty risks.\nWe have entered into interest rate swap arrangements to manage our exposure to our cash flows from increasing interest rates on our floating rate debt. If an interest rate swap counterparty cannot perform under the terms of the interest rate swap, we may not receive payments due under that swap, and thus, the instrument would no longer serve as an effective hedge against future cash flows, and we may lose any unrealized gain associated with the interest rate swap. Additionally, we may also risk the loss of any collateral we may be required to pledge to secure our obligations under the interest rate swap if the counterparty becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy. If we are required to sell our derivatives under these circumstances, we may incur losses.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nThe change in the television rating system in the United States could reduce our Networks revenue and our ability to achieve profitability.\nOur domestic advertising revenue is partially dependent on television ratings provided by Nielsen. Nielsen continually modifies its ratings system to accommodate emerging technologies and ongoing changes in the U.S. population. As the impact of the changes take effect, our ratings could either be positively or negatively affected by these changes, depending on the demographic characteristics of the households added to the Nielsen sample and the nature of any changes to their measurement systems. We continue to factor the new rating information into our advertising rates as Nielsen continues modifying its ratings system to accommodate emerging technologies.\nCompetition could reduce our Networks revenue and our ability to achieve profitability.\nWe operate in the pay television business, which is highly competitive. If we are unable to compete effectively with large diversified entertainment companies that have substantially greater resources than we have, our operating margins and market share could be reduced, and the growth of our business inhibited. In particular, we compete for distribution with other pay television networks and, when distribution is obtained, for viewers and advertisers with pay television networks, broadcast television networks, radio, the Internet and other emerging media. We also compete, to varying degrees, with other leisure-time activities such as movie theaters, the Internet, radio, print media, electronic games and other alternative sources of entertainment and information. Future technological developments may affect competition within this business.\nA continuing trend towards business combinations and alliances in the entertainment industry may create significant new competitors for us or intensify existing competition. Many of these combined entities have more than one network and resources far greater than ours. These combined entities may provide bundled packages of programming, delivery and other services that compete directly with the programming we offer. We cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may need to reduce our advertising prices or license additional programming to remain competitive. Our failure to achieve or sustain market acceptance of our programming at desired pricing levels could impair our ability to achieve profitability or positive cash flow, which would harm our business.\nDistributors in the United States may attempt to pressure pay TV networks having lower viewership, such as our Networks, to accept decreasing amounts for subscriber fees or to allow carriage of the Networks without the payment of subscriber fees. Factors that may lead to this pressure include the number of competing pay TV networks, the limited space available on services of distributors in the United States and the desire of distributors to maintain or reduce costs. Any reduction in subscriber fees revenue now or in the future could have a material impact on our operating results and cash flow.\nChanges in public and consumer tastes and preferences, including changes resulting from new technologies and distribution platforms, could reduce demand for our services and reduce profitability of our businesses.\nEach of our Networks provides content and services whose success is primarily dependent upon acceptance by the public, which is difficult to predict. Technology and business models in our industry continue to evolve rapidly. Consumer preferences and behaviors related to changes in content distribution and technological innovation change frequently and it is a challenge to anticipate what content will be successful at any point in time.\nWhile we aim to consistently create and distribute programming that appeals to our target consumer group at any point in time, some of our content and services may not be accepted by our target audience. Other factors, including the availability of alternative forms of entertainment or leisure time activities, general economic conditions and the growing competition for consumer discretionary spending may also affect our target audience\u2019s acceptance of our content and services.\nConsumers are increasingly viewing content on a time-delayed or on-demand basis from traditional distributors, from connected apps and websites and on a wide variety of screens, such as televisions, tablets, mobile phones and other devices. Time-shifting technologies that enable users to fast-forward or skip programming, including commercials, affect the attractiveness of our programming to advertisers and could therefore adversely affect our revenues. All of these factors create uncertainty in the marketplace, and there can be no assurance that the strategies we develop to address them will be effective. If our Networks do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance as a result of any of the foregoing factors, revenues may decline and adversely affect our profitability.\nWe face cybersecurity and similar risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information, disruption of our programming services, damage to our brands and reputation, legal exposure and financial losses.\nOur online, mobile and app offerings, as well as our internal systems, involve the storage and transmission of our and our users\u2019 proprietary information, and we and our partners rely on various technology systems in connection with the production and distribution of our programming. Despite our efforts, our security measures may be breached due to employee error, computer malware, viruses, hacking and phishing attacks, or otherwise. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 data. Moreover, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in a loss of our or our users\u2019 proprietary information, a disruption of our services or a reduction of the revenues we are able to generate from such services, damage to our brands and reputation, a loss of confidence in the security of our offerings and services, and significant legal and financial exposure, each of which could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business.\nNew distribution technologies may fundamentally change the way we distribute our Networks and could significantly decrease our revenue or require us to incur significant capital expenditures.\nOur future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes and to offer, on a timely basis, services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards. The pay television industry has been, and is likely to continue to be, subject to:\n\u00b7\nrapid and significant technological change, including continuing developments in technology which do not presently have widely accepted standards; and\n\u00b7\nfrequent introductions of new services and alternative technologies, including new technologies for providing video services.\nFor example, the advent of digital technology is likely to accelerate the convergence of broadcast, telecommunications, Internet and other media and could result in material changes in the economics, regulations, intellectual property usage and technical platforms on which our business relies, including lower retail rates for video services. These changes could fundamentally affect the scale, source, and volatility of our revenue streams, cost structures, and operating results, and may require us to significantly change our operations. If we fail to adapt to these changes, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also rely in part on third parties for the development of, and access to, communications and network technology. As a result, we may be unable to distribute our content via new technology on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, which could harm our business and prospects.\nMoreover, the increased capacity of digital distribution platforms, may reduce the competition for the right to carry networks and allow development of extra services at low incremental cost. These lower incremental costs could lower barriers to entry for competing networks, and place pressure on our operating margins and market position.\nCompetition from program suppliers and digital media companies that provide or facilitate the delivery of video content directly to viewers via the Internet may adversely affect the number of subscribers provided and fees paid to us by traditional cable, satellite and telco distributors, which could result in less revenue to us.\nOur channels are primarily distributed by satellite, cable and telco systems to home television devices. To the extent that viewers are able to receive programming directly over the internet from online services such as Netflix, Hulu, Apple, Amazon, Sony, Microsoft and Google and view this programming on computer, mobile phone and other portable devices both inside and outside the home, they may decide to eliminate their cable, satellite and telco subscriptions or to reduce the number of channels they purchase from these traditional distributors (\u201ccord-cutting\u201d or \u201ccord shaving\u201d). This trend could result in a decrease in the number of subscribers available to us through traditional distribution and therefore adversely affect our advertising and distribution fee revenue. Our ability to recapture these subscribers by distributing our programming over the internet and other new media platforms could be affected both by the investment required and by restrictions in our current distribution agreements.\nEconomic problems in the United States or in other parts of the world could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business is significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions and by disruption to financial markets. In particular, we derive substantial revenues from advertisers, and these expenditures are sensitive to general economic conditions and consumer buying patterns. Financial instability or a general decline in economic conditions in areas where our Networks are distributed could adversely affect advertising rates and volume, resulting in a decrease in our advertising revenues. In addition, decreases in consumer discretionary spending may affect television subscriptions. This could lead to a decrease in the number of subscribers receiving our programming from our distributors. Similarly, a decrease in viewing subscribers would also have a negative effect on our ratings, which may impact the rates we are able to charge our advertisers. Although we believe that our operating cash flow and current access to capital and credit markets, including our 2015 Credit Agreement, will give us the ability to meet our financial needs through 2016, there can be no assurance that future volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our cost of borrowing.\nEconomic conditions also affect the business of our partners. The companies who purchase advertising on our Networks may reduce their spending on advertising or our business partners may default on obligations owed to us.\nOur business is subject to risks of adverse changes in laws and regulations, which could result in reduced distribution of our Networks and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur programming and the distributors of our Networks are regulated by U.S. federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d), as well as by state and local governments. While we believe we are in material compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our operations will continue to materially comply with all applicable laws. In addition, Congress and the FCC currently have under consideration and may in the future adopt new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect our operations. For example, regulations that would require the unbundling of program services could reduce the distribution of our Networks, thereby leading to reduced ratings, increased marketing expenses, and lower subscription and advertising revenue. Any noncompliance with laws, regulations or policies currently applicable to our business or the enactment or adoption of new laws, regulations or policies applicable to our business could have a material adverse effect on our business.", "PERMNO": 88246, "SIC": 4841, "TIC": "CRWN"}
