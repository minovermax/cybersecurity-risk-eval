Net interest income is the difference between:\n\u2022\nthe interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities; and\n\u2022\nthe interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.\nIn addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. A reduction in interest rates results in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities, as borrowers refinance their debt in order to reduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities. Reinvestment risk remains high in the current rate environment. Increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and/or make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the current market value of our interest-earning securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates. At June 30, 2017 the fair value of our available for sale agency securities, mortgage-backed securities and corporate debt obligations totaled $97.9 million. Unrealized net gains on these available for sale securities totaled approximately $698,000 at June 30, 2017 and are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of taxes. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale in future periods would have an adverse effect on stockholders' equity.\nThe Company's net interest income is particularly vulnerable to a scenario in which market interest rates \"flatten.\" This would occur if short term interest rates were approximately the same rate as long term interest rates. In such a scenario, interest income would likely decrease and interest expense would likely increase.\nWe evaluate interest rate sensitivity by estimating the change in Oritani Bank's net portfolio value over a range of interest rate scenarios. Net portfolio value is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. At June 30, 2017, in the event of an immediate 200 basis point increase in interest rates, our financial model projects that we would experience a $72.4 million, or 12.29%, decrease in net portfolio value. See \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Management of Market Risk.\"\nLow Interest Rates May Adversely Affect Our Net Interest Income and Profitability.\nDuring the past eight years it has been the policy of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to maintain interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of mortgage-backed securities. As a result, market rates on the loans we have originated and the yields on securities we have purchased have been at lower levels than as available prior to 2008. Consequently, the average yield on our interest earning assets has decreased to 3.80% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 5.57% for the year ended June 30, 2009. The trend of decreasing average yield on interest earning assets is expected to continue primarily because the rates associated with new loan originations are still lower than the average yield on the existing portfolio. Our cost of interest bearing liabilities has also decreased over the period, to 1.14% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 3.21% for the year ended June 30, 2009.\nOur Continued Emphasis On Commercial Real Estate Lending Could Expose Us To Increased Lending Risks.\nOur business strategy centers on continuing our emphasis on residential and non-residential commercial real estate lending. We have grown our loan portfolio in recent years with respect to these types of loans and intend to continue to emphasize these types of lending. At June 30, 2017, $3.35 billion, or 92.86%, of our total loan portfolio consisted of residential and non-residential commercial real estate loans. As a result, our credit risk profile will be higher than traditional thrift institutions that have higher concentrations of one to four family residential loans. Loans secured by residential and non-residential commercial real estate generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one to four family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property and the income stream of the underlying property. This risk increases during a negative economic cycle. Additionally, such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one to four family residential mortgage loans. Accordingly, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one to four family residential mortgage loan. We seek to minimize these risks through our underwriting policies, which require such loans to be qualified on the basis of the property's collateral value, net income and debt service ratio; however, there is no assurance that our underwriting policies will protect us from credit-related losses. Finally, if we foreclose on residential and non-residential commercial real estate loans, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than one to four family residential mortgage loans because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral.\nIndex\nOur business strategy of commercial real estate lending could be negatively impacted by regulatory guidance. The FDIC has issued guidance that recommends that such loans should not exceed 300% of the bank's capital unless enhanced risk management measures are in place. The FDIC further detailed circumstances where such balances in excess of this guideline would be considered acceptable. The component of the Bank's commercial real estate loan portfolio impacted by the FDIC guidance as of June 30, 2017 represented 592.4% of the Bank's capital at that date. While the FDIC has not placed restrictions on the Bank's commercial real estate lending, there can be no assurance that such restrictions will not be imposed in the future.\nThe largest commercial real estate loan in our portfolio at June 30, 2017 was a $33.4 million loan secured by multi-tenant, mixed use buildings, located in Brooklyn, New York. Our largest loan relationship is secured by bank branches, CVS, and Walgreens stores located mainly in our primary market area with a real estate investor. The aggregate outstanding loan balance for this relationship is $63.9 million at June 30, 2017. As discussed in \"Business of Oritani Financial Corp-Lending Activities\", we have been utilizing stricter underwriting for these types of loans, and curtailed our construction lending.\nIf the Bank Regulators Impose Limitations on Our Commercial Real Estate Lending Activities, Our Earnings Could Be Adversely Affected.\nIn 2006, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (collectively, the \"Agencies\") issued joint guidance entitled \"Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices\" (the \"CRE Guidance\"). Although the CRE Guidance did not establish specific lending limits, it provides that a bank's commercial real estate lending exposure may receive increased supervisory scrutiny where total non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate and construction and land loans, represent 300% or more of an institution's total risk-based capital and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the preceding 36 months. Our level of non-owner occupied commercial real estate equaled 592.43% of our total risk-based capital at June 30, 2017. Including owner-occupied commercial real estate, our ratio of commercial real estate loans to total risk-based capital ratio would be 603.84% at June 30, 2017.\nIn December 2015, the Agencies released a new statement on prudent risk management for commercial real estate lending (the \"2015 Statement\"). In the 2015 Statement, the Agencies express concerns about easing commercial real estate underwriting standards, direct financial institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise risk management practices to identify, measure and monitor lending risks, and indicate that the Agencies will continue \"to pay special attention\" to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward. If the FDIC were to impose restrictions on the amount of commercial real estate loans we can hold in our portfolio, or require higher capital ratios as a result of the level of commercial real estate loans we hold, our earnings could be adversely affected.\nIf Our Allowance for Loan Losses is Not Sufficient to Cover Actual Loan Losses, Our Earnings Will Decrease.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance. While our allowance for loan losses was 0.84% of total loans at June 30, 2017, material additions to our allowance could materially decrease our net income.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA New Accounting Standard will Likely Require us to Increase Our Allowance for Loan Losses and May Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for the Company and Oritani Bank for our first fiscal year after December 15, 2019. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which would likely require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and to greatly increase the types of data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIndex\nOur Risk Management Program May Not Be Effective in Mitigating Risk and Reducing the Potential for Significant Losses.\nOur risk management program is designed to minimize risk and loss to us. We seek to identify, measure, monitor, report and control our exposure to risk, including strategic, market, liquidity, compliance and operational risks. While we use a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring, modeling and mitigation techniques, these techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks. Recent economic conditions and heightened regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry, among other developments, have increased our level of risk. Accordingly, we could suffer losses as a result of our failure to properly anticipate and manage these risks.\nBecause the Nature of the Financial Services Business Involves a High Volume of Transactions, We Face Significant Operational Risks.\nWe operate in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. In the event of a breakdown in the internal control system, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action, and suffer damage to our reputation.\nRisks Associated with System Failures, Interruptions, or Breaches of Security Could Negatively Affect Our Earnings.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches (including privacy breaches), but such events may still occur and may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition any compromise of our systems could deter customers from using our products and services. Although we rely on security systems to provide security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of security.\nIn addition, we outsource a majority of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nAttempts by hackers to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to a computer, computer system, or electronic communications network have increased in frequency, particularly on financial institutions. While we have systems in place designed to detect and prevent such cyber attacks, successful intrusions have been perpetrated at other financial institutions and we cannot guarantee that we will not be impacted by such an event.\nThe occurrence of any system failures, interruption, or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business thereby subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIndex\nRisks Associated with Cyber-Security Could Negatively Affect Our Earnings.\nThe financial services industry has experienced an increase in both the number and severity of reported cyber attacks aimed at gaining unauthorized access to bank systems as a way to misappropriate assets and sensitive information, corrupt and destroy data, or cause operational disruptions\nWe have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of security breaches, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. Although we rely on security safeguards to secure our data, these safeguards may not fully protect our systems from compromises or breaches.\nWe also rely on the integrity and security of a variety of third party processors, payment, clearing and settlement systems, as well as the various participants involved in these systems, many of which have no direct relationship with us. Failure by these participants or their systems to protect our customers' transaction data may put us at risk for possible losses due to fraud or operational disruption.\nOur customers are also the target of cyber attacks and identity theft. Large scale identity theft could result in customers' accounts being compromised and fraudulent activities being performed in their name. We have implemented certain safeguards against these types of activities but they may not fully protect us from fraudulent financial losses.\nThe occurrence of a breach of security involving our customers' information, regardless of its origin, could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations\nStrong Competition Within Our Market Area May Limit Our Growth and Profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with numerous commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have, have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. The greater resources and deposit and loan products offered by some of our competitors may limit our ability to increase our loan and deposit balances, and/or decrease our net interest spread. For additional information see \"Business of Oritani Financial Corp-Competition.\"\nWe Operate in a Highly Regulated Industry, Which Limits the Manner and Scope of Our Business Activities.\nWe are subject to extensive supervision, regulation and examination by the NJDOBI, FDIC and Federal Reserve Board. As a result, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, undertake new investments and activities and obtain financing. This regulatory structure is designed primarily for the protection of the DIF and our depositors, and not to benefit our stockholders. This regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to capital levels, the timing and amount of dividend payments, stock repurchases, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. In addition, we must comply with significant anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws. Government agencies have substantial discretion to impose significant monetary penalties on institutions which fail to comply with these laws.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act has changed the bank regulatory framework, created an independent consumer protection bureau that has assumed the consumer protection responsibilities of the various federal banking agencies, and established more stringent capital standards for banks and bank holding companies. Bank regulatory agencies also have been responding aggressively to concerns and adverse trends identified in examinations. Ongoing uncertainty and adverse developments in the financial services industry and the domestic and international credit markets, and the effect of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulatory actions, may adversely affect our operations by restricting our business activities, including our ability to originate or sell loans, modify loan terms, or foreclose on property securing loans. These risks could affect the performance and value of our loan and investment securities portfolios, which also would negatively affect our financial performance.", "PERMNO": 91743, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "ORIT"}
