Risk Factors\nOur future results may be affected by a number of factors over which we have little or no control. The following issues, uncertainties, and risks, among others, should be considered in evaluating our business and growth outlook.\nOur business is subject to general economic and business factors that are largely out of our control, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur business depends on a number of factors that may have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, many of which are beyond our control. Some of the most significant of these factors include excess tractor and trailer capacity in the trucking industry, declines in the resale value of used equipment, strikes or work stoppages, work slowdowns at our facilities or at customer, port, border crossing, or other shipping related facilities, increases in interest rates, fuel taxes, tolls, and license and registration fees, rising costs of healthcare, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nWe are also affected by recessionary economic cycles, changes in customers\u2019 inventory levels, and downturns in our customers\u2019 business cycles, particularly in market segments and industries, such as retail and manufacturing, where we have significant customer concentration, and regions of the country, such as Texas and the Midwest, where we have a significant amount of business. Economic conditions may adversely affect our customers and their demand for and ability to pay for our services. Customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss and we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts. These economic conditions may adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic plan.\nIn addition, we cannot predict future economic conditions, consumer confidence, the economic impact of actual or threatened armed conflicts or terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism, military action against a foreign state or group located in a foreign state, or heightened security requirements. Enhanced security measures could impair our operating efficiency and productivity and result in higher operating costs.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry and our business may suffer if we are unable to adequately address downward pricing pressures and other results of competition.\nNumerous competitive factors present in our industry could impair our ability to maintain or improve our current profitability. These factors include the following:\n\u00b7\nWe compete with many other truckload carriers of varying sizes and, to a lesser extent, with less-than-truckload carriers, railroads, and other transportation and logistics companies, many of which have access to more equipment and greater capital resources than we do.\n\u00b7\nMany of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or maintain significant growth in our business.\n\u00b7\nMany customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting so-called \"core carriers\" as approved service providers or by engaging dedicated providers, and in some instances we may not be selected.\n\u00b7\nMany customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors.\n\u00b7\nThe trend toward consolidation in the trucking industry may create other large carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size.\n\u00b7\nThe market for qualified drivers is increasingly competitive, and our inability to attract and retain drivers could reduce our utilization or cause us to increase compensation, both of which would adversely affect our profitability.\n\u00b7\nCompetition from non-asset based logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect our customer relationships and freight rates.\n\u00b7\nEconomies of scale that may be passed on to smaller carriers by procurement aggregation providers may improve their ability to compete with us.\nIncreases in driver compensation or difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers could affect our profitability and ability to grow.\nThe trucking industry experiences substantial difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers, including independent contractors. The shortage of qualified drivers is exacerbated by several factors, including the availability of alternative jobs, intense competition for drivers from other trucking companies, and the impact of regulatory initiatives, including CSA and new hours-of-service regulations. The competitive market for drivers has impacted our ability to increase our utilization and has resulted in us pursuing alternative methods to attract new employees, such as our driver school. In addition, economic conditions such as the cost and availability of fuel, insurance, tractors, and financing can negatively impact the available pool of independent contractor drivers. Our continued success is dependent on our ability to also engage a sufficient number of independent contractors, and our inability to do so may negatively impact our operations. Further, the compensation we offer our drivers and independent contractors is subject to market conditions, and we may find it necessary to increase driver and independent contractor compensation in future periods. A high turnover rate and competitive market for drivers and independent contractors requires us to continually recruit a substantial number of drivers and independent contractors and to focus on alternative recruitment methods in order to operate existing revenue equipment. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain a sufficient number of drivers and independent contractors, including through our driver school, we could be required to adjust our compensation packages, let trucks sit idle, or operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting shipper demands, all of which would reduce our ability to serve our customers and would adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nIf our independent contractors are deemed by regulators or judicial process to be employees, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRegulatory authorities and plaintiffs in certain jurisdictions have asserted that independent contractor drivers in the trucking industry are employees, rather than independent contractors, for a variety of purposes, including income tax withholding, workers\u2019 compensation, wage and hour compensation unemployment, and other issues. Federal legislation has been introduced in the past that would make it easier for tax and other authorities to reclassify independent contractors as employees, including legislation to increase the recordkeeping requirements for those that engage independent contractor drivers and to increase the penalties for companies who misclassify their employees and are found to have violated employees\u2019 overtime and/or wage requirements. Additionally, federal legislators have sought to abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers meeting certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a long-standing, recognized practice, extend the Fair Labor Standards Act to independent contractors, and impose notice requirements based on employment or independent contractor status and fines for failure to comply. Some states have put initiatives in place to increase their revenue from items such as unemployment, workers\u2019 compensation, and income taxes, and a reclassification of independent contractors as employees would help states with this initiative. In addition, owner-operators occasionally bring lawsuits against motor carriers alleging that they are employees and seeking employment and unemployment benefits. Taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determination of independent contractor status. If our independent contractors are determined to be employees, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment, and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings.\nOngoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly affect our earnings.\nOur business results in a substantial number of claims and litigation related to personal injuries, property damage, workers\u2019 compensation, employment issues, health care, and other issues. We self-insure for a significant portion of our claims exposure, which could increase the volatility of, and decrease the amount of, our earnings. Our future insurance and claims expenses may exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. We currently accrue amounts for liabilities based on our assessment of claims that arise and our insurance coverage for the periods in which the claims arise and we evaluate and revise these accruals from time-to-time based on additional information. Because of our significant self-insured amounts, we have exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims and the risk of being required to accrue or pay additional amounts if our estimates are revised or the claims ultimately prove to be more severe than originally assessed.\nWe maintain insurance for most risks above the amounts for which we self-insure. If any claim were to exceed our coverage, or fall outside the coverage, we would bear the excess or uncovered amount, in addition to our other self-insured amounts. If insurance carriers raise our premiums, our insurance and claims expense could increase, or we could find it necessary to again raise our self-insured retention or decrease our aggregate coverage limits when our policies are renewed or replaced. Our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if these expenses increase, if we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, or if we experience a claim for which we do not have coverage.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from our major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nA significant portion of our revenue is generated from our major customers. For fiscal 2015, our top 10 customers, based on revenue, accounted for approximately 21.5% of our revenue. We do not expect this percentage to change materially for fiscal 2016. Generally, we do not have long-term contractual relationships with our major customers, and we cannot provide assurance that our customers will continue to use our services or that they will continue at the same levels. A reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nOur revenue growth may not continue at historical rates, which could adversely affect our stock price.\nOur revenue growth over the past five years has been attributable to an improving economic and freight pricing environment, acquisitions, and expansions of our suite of services. Economic weakness, a failure to consummate acquisitions, disposing of a business line (such as our prior disposition of Truckers B2B), or failure to attract and retain sufficient drivers could lead to a reduction in our revenue growth or lower revenue. Slower revenue growth could adversely affect our stock price.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nOur operations are regulated and licensed by various U.S., Canadian, and Mexican agencies. Our drivers and independent contractors also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the DOT, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours-of-service. Such matters as weight and equipment dimensions are also subject to U.S. and Canadian regulations. We also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions, drivers\u2019 hours-of-service, ergonomics, or other matters affecting safety or operating methods. Other agencies, such as the EPA and the Department of Homeland Security also regulate our equipment, operations, and drivers. Future laws and regulations may be more stringent and require changes in our operating practices, influence the demand for transportation services, or require us to incur significant additional costs. Higher costs incurred by us or by our suppliers who pass the costs onto us through higher prices could adversely affect our results of operations. The Regulation section in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K discusses several proposed and final regulations that could materially impact our business and operations.\nThe DOT\u2019s CSA program could adversely affect our profitability and operations, our ability to maintain or grow our fleet, and our customer relationships.\nUnder CSA, drivers and fleets are evaluated based on certain safety-related standards. Carriers\u2019 safety and fitness ratings under CSA include the on-road safety performance of the carrier\u2019s drivers. As a result of these increased standards, drivers who do not meet such standards are not eligible to drive for us. If we experience safety and fitness violations, our fleet could be ranked poorly as compared to our peers, and our safety and fitness scores could be adversely impacted. A reduction in our safety and fitness scores or those of our drivers could also reduce our competitiveness in relation to other companies who retain higher scores. Additionally, competition for drivers with favorable safety ratings may increase and thus provide for increases in driver related compensation costs.\nFuture fitness and safety violations may cause us to exceed the intervention threshold in one or more of the safety and fitness categories evaluated under CSA. If this were to occur we may be prioritized for an intervention action or roadside inspection, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations. Failure to cure any such deficiency could cause high-quality drivers to seek other carriers or could cause our customers to direct their business away from us and to carriers with higher fleet rankings, either of which would adversely affect our results of operations. Currently, we are exceeding the established intervention thresholds in one of the seven safety-related Behavioral Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories (\"BASIC\") categories of CSA, in comparison to our peer group; however, we continue to maintain a satisfactory rating with the DOT. In the past from time to time we have exceeded BASIC category thresholds and have worked to monitor and improve scores below intervention levels. Exceeding the established intervention thresholds in additional BASIC categories may result in another compliance review or the prioritization of roadside inspections, either of which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may not make acquisitions in the future or, if we do, we may not be successful in our acquisition strategy.\nWe have pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy in recent years, having made approximately thirty-four acquisitions since 1995, and approximately eleven since the beginning of fiscal 2014. Accordingly, acquisitions have provided a substantial portion of our growth. There is no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating, or consummating any future acquisitions. If we fail to make any future acquisitions, our growth rate could be materially and adversely affected.\nAny acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nfailure of the acquired company to achieve anticipated revenues, earnings, or cash flows;\n\u00b7\ndilutive issuance of equity securities and/or incurring indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nthe assumption of liabilities, including undisclosed liabilities and liabilities that exceed our estimates;\n\u00b7\ninability to negotiate effective indemnification protection from the seller, or inability to collect in the event of an indemnity claim;\n\u00b7\nproblems integrating the purchased operations with our own, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical, or financial problems;\n\u00b7\npotential compliance issues with regard to acquired companies that did not have adequate internal controls;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention or other resources from our existing business;\n\u00b7\nrisks associated with entering markets or business lines in which we have had no or limited prior experience;\n\u00b7\nincreases in working capital and capital expenditure investment to fund the growth of acquired operations;\n\u00b7\npotential loss of customers, key employees, drivers, and independent contractors of the acquired company; and\n\u00b7\nfuture write-offs of intangible and other assets if the acquired operations fail to generate sufficient cash flows.\nIf we make acquisitions in the future, there is no assurance that operations, assets, and personnel of the acquired operations will be successfully and profitably integrated into our existing business.\nWe have significant ongoing capital requirements that could affect our profitability if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and obtain financing on favorable terms.\nThe trucking industry is capital intensive, and our policy of operating newer equipment requires us to expend significant amounts annually. If we elect to expand our fleet in future periods, our capital needs would increase. We expect to pay for projected capital expenditures with a combination of capital and operating leases, cash flows from operations, and borrowings under our line of credit. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and obtain financing on favorable terms in the future, we may have to limit our growth, enter into less favorable financing arrangements, or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability.\nFluctuations in the price or availability of fuel, as well as hedging activities, surcharge collection, and the volume and terms of diesel fuel purchase commitments may increase our cost of operation, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability.\nFuel is one of our largest operating expenses. Diesel fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to economic, political, climatic, and other factors beyond our control. Fuel is also subject to regional pricing differences and often costs more on the West Coast, where we have significant operations. From time-to-time we have used fuel surcharges, hedging contracts, and volume purchase arrangements to attempt to limit the effect of price fluctuations. Although we seek to recover a portion of the short-term increases in fuel prices from customers through fuel surcharges, these arrangements do not fully offset the increase in the cost of diesel fuel and also may result in us not receiving the full benefit of any fuel price decreases. Fluctuations in fuel prices, a shortage of diesel fuel, or increased consumption due to adverse weather could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we cannot effectively manage the challenges associated with doing business internationally, our revenues and profitability may suffer.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from our international operations, and our success is dependent upon our operations in Mexico and Canada. Our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, including fluctuations in foreign currencies, changes in the economic strength of the foreign countries in which we do business, difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights, compliance burdens associated with a wide variety of international and United States export and import laws, and social, political, and economic instability. Our international business could be adversely affected by restrictions on travel to any of our three countries of operations due to a health epidemic or outbreak, and any such epidemic or outbreak may adversely affect demand for freight. Additional risks associated with our foreign operations include restrictive trade policies, imposition of duties, taxes, or government royalties by foreign governments, and compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery law compliance. Pursuant to an agreement between the United States and Mexico, cross-border movements for both United States and Mexican-based carriers into the United States and Mexico are now allowed, which presents an additional risk in the form of the potential for increased competition in Mexico and the risk of increased congestion on our cross-border lanes. In addition, we could be subject to additional regulatory risks related to the use of Mexican drivers through our Mexico subsidiary for shipments into the United States.\nIncreased prices, reduced productivity, reduced demand for our used equipment, and restricted availability of new revenue equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.\nWe have experienced higher prices for new tractors over the past few years, attributable to government regulations applicable to newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines, higher commodity prices, and better pricing power among equipment manufacturers. EPA emissions standards that went into effect in 2010 are more stringent than prior standards and have required the introduction of new, more expensive engines, and future emission reduction regulations may require vendors to further modify new equipment which may lead to further increases in cost. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to continue to obtain an adequate supply of new tractors and trailers for these or other reasons. As a result, we expect to continue to pay increased prices for equipment and incur additional expenses and related financing costs for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, reduced equipment efficiency and lower fuel mileage may result from new engines designed to reduce emissions, therefore, increase our operating expenses. Our decision to shorten our equipment upgrade cycle may increase the impact of higher equipment cost on our profitability.\nAs we continually replace our equipment and occasionally seek to dispose of outdated equipment obtained through our acquisitions, we rely on the used equipment market to extract remaining value out of our used equipment. The market for used equipment is impacted by several factors, including the demand for freight, the supply of used equipment, and the availability of financing. A deterioration of demand for used equipment could make it more difficult to dispose of and replace older equipment and may reduce our ability to refresh our fleet and dispose of less fuel efficient equipment obtained through acquisitions, both of which could negatively impact our profitability.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties.\nIn addition to the regulation of our drivers under CSA, our transportation activities are regulated by the DOT and other agencies. These regulations include weight and equipment requirements, operating methods, safety rules, and other regulations. In addition to direct regulation under the DOT and related agencies, we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the hauling and handling of hazardous materials, fuel storage tanks, air emissions from our vehicles and facilities, and discharge and retention of storm water. We operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located, and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination are possible. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. We also maintain underground bulk fuel storage tanks and fueling islands at several of our facilities. A small percentage of our freight consists of low-grade hazardous substances, which subjects us to an additional array of regulations. A spill or other accident involving hazardous substances, releases of hazardous substances we transport, or a finding that we are in violation of environmental laws or regulations could subject us to liabilities that could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results. If we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability.\nIn 2010, stricter fuel efficiency and emissions standards were mandated by the EPA. In 2011, the EPA and NHTSA proposed further efficiency and emissions standards that went into effect in 2014. These new standards include a mandated 20% improvement in fuel economy by 2018. Engines meeting new emissions standards generally cost more and require additional maintenance compared with earlier models. Compliance with such regulations has increased the cost of our new tractors and could increase our operating expenses.\nConcern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Regulatory and legislative activity in this area has increased, and future emission regulations or legislation are possible. Regulations related to climate change that potentially impose restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases could adversely affect our operations and financial results. More specifically, legislative or regulatory actions related to climate change could adversely impact us by increasing our fuel costs and reducing fuel efficiency and could result in the creation of substantial additional capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes, emissions allowances, or required equipment upgrades. Until the timing, scope, and extent of any future regulation becomes known, we cannot predict its effect on our cost structure or our operating results; however, any future regulation could impair our operating efficiency and productivity and result in higher operating costs.\nIf we are unable to retain our key employees, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are highly dependent upon the services of certain key employees, including, but not limited to: Paul Will, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board; William E. Meek, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bobby Peavler, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The loss of their services could negatively impact our operations and future profitability.\nSeasonality and the impact of weather affect our operations and profitability.\nOur tractor productivity decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations, and some shippers reduce their shipments after the winter holiday season. Revenue can also be affected by bad weather and holidays, since revenue is directly related to available working days of shippers. At the same time, operating expenses increase, with fuel efficiency declining because of engine idling and harsh weather creating higher accident frequency, increased claims, and more equipment repairs. The impact of adverse weather events, including short-term impacts from weather-related events such as hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, and floods, could diminish our profitability or make our operating results more volatile.\nOur business is subject to certain credit factors affecting the trucking industry that are largely out of our control and that could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results.\nIf the economy and credit markets weaken, our business, financial results, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, especially if consumer confidence declines and domestic spending decreases. We may need to incur additional indebtedness or issue debt or equity securities in the future to fund working capital requirements, make investments, or for general corporate purposes. If the credit and equity markets were to erode, our ability to do so may be constrained. A decline in the credit or equity markets or any increase in volatility could make it more difficult for us to obtain financing and may lead to an adverse impact on our profitability and operations.\nOur primary credit agreement contains certain covenants, restrictions, and requirements, and we may be unable to comply with the covenants, restrictions, and requirements. A default could result in the acceleration of all or part of our outstanding indebtedness, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and the price of our common stock.\nWe have financing arrangements that contain certain restrictions and covenants relating to, among other things, dividends, liens, acquisitions and dispositions outside of the ordinary course of business, affiliate transactions, and financial covenants. If we fail to comply with any of our financing arrangement covenants, restrictions, and requirements, we will be in default under the relevant agreement, which could cause the acceleration of our obligations under such agreement. Deterioration in the credit markets may make it difficult or expensive to refinance accelerated debt or we may have to issue equity securities, which would dilute stock ownership. Even if new financing is made available to us, the current lack of available credit and consequent more stringent borrowing terms may mean that credit is not available to us on acceptable terms. A default under our financing arrangements could cause a materially adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. See the Primary Credit Agreement section in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our primary credit agreement.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to fulfill our obligations and operate our business.\nWe have a significant amount of debt and our ongoing capital needs are extensive. Our indebtedness could result in the following consequences:\n\u00b7\nincreased vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nincreased vulnerability to interest rate increases on our variable rate debt;\n\u00b7\ncommitment of a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7\nlimit flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business;\n\u00b7\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have less debt; and\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds.\nThe rapid growth of our Quality Companies business unit and our reliance on the financing arrangement with Element Financial Corporation pose unique risks.\nOur Quality Companies business unit offers \"tractors under management\" to independent contractors, motor carrier fleets, and financing sources. Quality\u2019s services include tractor purchasing and sales, driver recruiting, lease payment remittance, insurance, maintenance, and other services. A portion of the tractors under management are contracted to Celadon by independent contractors who drive for us. The remaining tractors are contracted to other fleets. Quality\u2019s business has grown rapidly, from 750 tractors under management at June 30, 2013, to 4,900 tractors under management at June 30, 2015. Additionally, Quality has placed initial orders for 13,000 tractors scheduled for delivery over the next several years, at an aggregate estimated purchase price in excess of $1.5 billion.\nSince March of 2014, Quality has placed the majority of its tractors under management through a Program Agreement and Service Agreement with Element. Pursuant to these agreements, we use our volume purchasing power to purchase tractors on favorable pricing terms, which we then sell to Element. We believe Element acquires substantially all of these tractors through the incurrence of debt. We then refer our independent contractor drivers to Element, who leases tractors to such independent contractors or finances the drivers\u2019 purchase of tractors. Element has credit profile, customer concentration, and other business goals and restrictions, and may not grow, or even continue to finance tractors. If Element curtails its participation in this arrangement, Quality\u2019s business would be adversely affected. In addition, Quality\u2019s operations pose several unique risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nIn general, Quality\u2019s tractor purchase orders do not become \"firm commitment\" orders for which we are irrevocably obligated until shortly before purchase. However, our failure to consummate these orders could have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects. We may be unsuccessful in locating or reaching agreeable terms with third parties to purchase tractors from us in a volume that is adequate to meet Quality\u2019s current or anticipated operations.\n\u00b7\nElement or other third parties may be unable to obtain sufficient financing to acquire from us the volume of tractors that we plan to purchase and resell. This may require us to finance the acquisition of such tractors with our own indebtedness, which could substantially increase our indebtedness, require dilutive issuance of securities, or both. Alternatively, we could be forced to inhibit Quality\u2019s growth. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such direct financing on favorable terms or at all.\n\u00b7\nHistorically the markets for new and used tractors have been volatile. A change in these markets could negatively impact the price at which Quality is able to acquire and sell tractors, negatively impact Quality\u2019s ability to resell tractors at a profit, and negatively impact the interests of Element and other financing sources in purchasing the tractors and providing financing.\n\u00b7\nIf a change in accounting rules or other unforeseen circumstances prevents us from using our intended accounting treatment for the Element arrangements or similar arrangements we may be required to include the related equipment debt in our consolidated results of operations even though we are not primarily obligated on and do not guarantee such debt. This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and stock price.\n\u00b7\nWe are not obligated to make payments in respect of the leases or financing provided by Element to the independent contractors. However, under certain circumstances we may be required to take certain actions to recover the vehicle, find a new driver, repair the vehicle, or prepare it for service. We also may be required to repurchase certain leases or financings from Element upon Quality\u2019s uncured material breach of the Program Agreement. We expect that it would be difficult to recoup the costs associated with these actions, especially if there were a decline in the used equipment market.\n\u00b7\nWe may experience reputational or commercial pressure from financing sources and suppliers to protect them against or reimburse them for losses relating to our arrangement with Element or similar arrangements, even if we are not legally obligated to do so.\n\u00b7\nWe may experience commercial pressure from Element or other third parties with whom we enter into similar arrangements to add additional driver recruiting, truck maintenance and repossession, or other services, any of which could increase our costs.\nWe depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems and a system failure could cause a significant disruption to our business and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems, including financial reporting and operating systems, in operating our business. Our operating system is critical to understanding customer demands, accepting and planning loads, dispatching equipment and drivers, and billing and collecting for our services. Our financial reporting system is critical to producing accurate and timely financial statements and analyzing business information to help us manage effectively. If any of our critical information systems fail or become otherwise unavailable, whether as a result of the upgrade project or otherwise, we would have to perform the functions manually, which could temporarily impact our ability to manage our fleet efficiently, to respond to customers' requests effectively, to maintain billing and other records reliably, and to bill for services and prepare financial statements accurately or in a timely manner. Our business interruption insurance may be inadequate to protect us in the event of an unforeseeable and extreme catastrophe. Any system failure, delays, or complications, security breach, or other system failure could interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation, cause us to lose customers, or impact our ability to manage our operations and report our financial performance, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.", "PERMNO": 80113, "SIC": 4213, "TIC": "CGIPQ"}
