{"cik": "31107", "company": "EASTERN CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A\nRISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K and the exhibits hereto and the Company's other filings with the SEC, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company's business. The Company's business, financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks or additional risks not presently known to the Company, or by risks the Company currently deems immaterial. which may also adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations, such as: changes in the economy, including changes in inflation, tax rates, interest rates and currency exchange rates; risk associated with possible disruption in the Company's operations due to terrorism, cybersecurity threats and other manmade or natural disasters; future regulatory actions, legal issues or environmental matters; loss of, or changes in, executive management; and changes in accounting standards that are adverse to the Company. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the Company has correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting its business or that information publicly available with respect to these matters is complete and correct.\nThe Company's business is subject to risks associated with conducting business overseas.\nInternational operations could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, differing intellectual property rights and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs. Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies could result in increases or decreases in earnings and may adversely affect the value of the Company's assets outside the United States. The Company's operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations. These trade agreements could impose requirements that adversely affect the Company's business, such as, but not limited to, setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into the Company's key markets in North America.\nThe Company's ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the United States or other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or require the Company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on the Company's business, financial conditions or results of operations.\nIndebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.\nAs of December, 31, 2017, the Company had $35,225,000 in total consolidated indebtedness. Subject to restrictions contained in our credit facility, the Company may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions. The level of indebtedness and servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operation and business strategy. For example, the indebtedness could:\n\u00b7\nPlace the Company at a competitive disadvantage relative to the Company's competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources;\n\u00b7\nLimit our ability to borrow additional funds;\n\u00b7\nLimit our ability to complete future acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nLimit our ability to pay dividends;\n\u00b7\nLimit our ability to make capital expenditures; and\n\u00b7\nIncrease the Company's vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.\nThe Company's ability to make scheduled principal payments, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy other debt obligations will depend upon future operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond the Company's control. In addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or the issuance of equity would be available to the Company on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of the Company's debt. If the Company is unable to service its indebtedness, the business, financial condition and results of operation would be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company's credit facility contains covenants requiring the Company to achieve certain financial and operations results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. The Company's ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in its credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and the Company may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or the Company's inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in our credit facility could result in an event of default under such credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility and/or the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our credit facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, the Company's assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our credit facility or the Company's other indebtedness. See also \"ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\" of this Form 10-K.\nIn addition, the Company's growth strategy involves expanding sales of its products into foreign markets. There is no guarantee that the Company's products will be accepted by foreign customers or how long it may take to develop sales of the Company's products in these foreign markets.\nIncreases in the price or reduced availability of raw materials.\nRaw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from numerous suppliers. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are readily available on the open market from a variety of producers. However, from time to time, the prices and availability of these raw materials fluctuate, which could impair the Company's ability to procure the required raw materials for its operations or increase the cost of manufacturing its products. If the price of raw materials increases, the Company may be unable to pass these increases on to its customers and could experience reductions to its profit margins. Also, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair the Company's ability to meet production requirements in a timely manner.\nIf tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, such as those recently proposed by the President of the United States, are implemented, our cost of raw materials may increase, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company obtains raw materials, including stainless steel used in the production of its products from domestic, Asian affiliated and nonaffiliated sources. The President of the United States recently announced a proposal to impose tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on imported aluminum through the issuance of an executive order. If implemented, such tariffs may cause an increase in costs for all domestic entities, including the Company, that purchase imported steel or aluminum. Because steel are raw materials used in a wide-range of the Company's products, a broad-based cost increase would result in an increase in the Company's cost of goods sold, which may require us to increase prices for some of our products. However, our inability to pass along such price increases to our customers, or an inability of our suppliers to meet our raw material requirements, may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nChanges in competition in the markets that the Company services could impact revenues and earnings.\nAny change in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices, which could result in reduced profits and margins. This may impair the ability to grow or even maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. While the Company has an extensive customer base, loss of certain customers could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations until such business is replaced, and no assurances can be made that the Company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers.\nThe Company is required to evaluate its internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nThe Company is an \"accelerated filer\" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act and is thus required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 requires the Company to include in its report management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal period for which the Company is filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K. This report must also include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that the Company has identified. Additionally, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is required to issue a report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting and their evaluation of the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Company's assessment requires it to make subjective judgments, and the independent registered public accounting firm may not agree with the Company's assessment. If the Company or its independent registered public accounting firm were unable to complete the assessments within the period prescribed by Section 404 and thus be unable to conclude that the internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in the Company's reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Company's common stock or impact the Company's borrowing ability. In addition, changes in operating conditions and changes in compliance with policies and procedures currently in place may result in inadequate internal control over financial reporting in the future.\nThe inability to develop new products could limit growth.\nDemand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new competitive products at favorable profit margins could adversely affect the Company's performance and prospects for future growth, and the Company would not be positioned to maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. The uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products, such as the market demands and the costs of development and production, may impede the successful development and introduction of new products. Acceptance of the new products may not meet sales expectations due to several factors, such as the Company's potential inability to accurately predict market demand or to resolve technical issues in a timely and cost effective manner. Additionally, the inability to develop new products on a timely basis could result in the loss of business to competitors.\nThe inability to identify or complete acquisitions could limit growth.\nThe Company's future growth may partly depend on its ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses. The Company intends to seek additional acquisition opportunities, both to expend into new markets and to enhance the Company's position in existing markets. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate terms, obtain financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets. Once acquired, operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability.\nAcquisitions involve risk, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. Although the Company's management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there can be no assurances that the Company's management will properly ascertain all such risks. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial debt and other expenses. Future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. Difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase the Company's expenses and adversely affect the Company's financial condition.\nThe Company's operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. These laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. The Company must conform its operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which the Company's divisions operate as these requirements change.\nThe Company uses and generates hazardous substances and wastes in its operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury. The Company has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations. In connection with the Company's acquisitions, the Company may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which it may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require the Company to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur technology is important to the Company's success and the failure to protect this technology could put the Company at a competitive disadvantage.\nSome of the Company's products rely on proprietary technology; therefore, the Company believes that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of its business. Despite the Company's efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use the Company's products or technology. Actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and the Company make no assurances that any such actions will be successful.\nThe Company relies on information and technology for many of its business operations, which could fail and cause disruption to the Company's business operations.\nThe Company's business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit, process and store electronic information and to communicate among its locations around the world and with clients and vendors. A shut-down of, or inability to access, one or more of the Company's facilities, a power outage or a failure of one or more of the Company's information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair the Company's ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. Computer viruses, cyberattacks, other external hazards and human error could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information, corruption of data or operational disruption. If sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, system failure, service denial or data loss and damage could result in a deterioration of the Company's ability to write and process orders, provide customer service or perform other necessary business functions.\nA breach in the security of the Company's software could harm its reputation, result in a loss of current and potential customers and subject the Company to material claims, which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition.\nIf the Company's security measures are breached, an unauthorized party may obtain access to the Company's data or users' or customers' data. In addition, cyber-attacks and similar acts could lead to interruptions and delays in customer processing or a loss or breach of a customer's data. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm the Company's business is likely to increase as the Company expands the number of web-based products we offer, the services we provide, and our global operations.\nRegulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with the Company's data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that the Company change its data practices, which could have an adverse effect on its business and results of operations.\nAny security breaches for which the Company is, or is perceived to be, responsible, in whole or in part, could subject us to legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations, which could harm the Company's reputation and result in significant litigation costs and damage awards or settlement amounts. Any imposition of liability, particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage, could materially harm our operating results and financial condition. Security breaches also could cause the Company to lose current and potential customers, which could have an adverse effect on\nour business. Moreover, the Company might be required to expend significant financial and other resources to further protect against security breaches or to rectify problems caused by any security breach.\nThe Company could be subject to litigation, which could have a material impact on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFrom time to time, the Company's operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, and environmental and employment matters, which are defended and settled in the ordinary course of business. While the Company is unable to predict the outcome of any of these matters, it does not believe, based upon currently available information, that the resolution of any pending matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. See \"ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\" in this Form 10-K for a discussion of current litigation.\nThe Company could be subject to additional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to income tax laws of the United States, its states and municipalities and those of other foreign jurisdictions in which the Company has business operations. These laws are complex and subject to interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment and interpretation is required in determining the Company's worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, transactions arise where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although the Company believes that our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Based on the status of a given tax audit or related litigation, a material effect on the Company's income tax provision or net income may result during the period or periods from the initial recognition of a particular matter in the Company's reported financial results to the final closure of that tax audit or settlement of related litigation when the ultimate tax and related cash flow is known with certainty.\nThe Company's goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may become impaired, which could require a significant charge to earnings to be recognized.\nUnder accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually. Future operating results used in the assumptions, such as sales or profit forecasts, may not materialize, and the Company could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment is determined, resulting in an unfavorable impact on our results of operations. Numerous assumptions are used in the evaluation of impairment, and there is no guarantee that the Company's independent registered public accounting firm would reach the same conclusion as the Company or an independent valuation firm, which could result in a disagreement between management and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.\nThe Company may need additional capital in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nFrom time-to-time, the Company has historically relied on outside financing to fund expanded operations, capital expenditure programs and acquisitions. The Company may require additional capital in the future to fund operations or strategic opportunities. The Company cannot be assured that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, the terms of available financing may place limits on the Company's financial and operating flexibility. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient capital in the future, the Company may not be able to expand or acquire complementary businesses and may not be able to continue to develop new products or otherwise respond to changing business conditions or competitive pressures.\nThe Company's stock price may become highly volatile.\nThe Company's stock price may change dramatically when buyers seeking to purchase shares of the Company's common stock exceed the shares available on the market, or when there are no buyers to purchase shares of the Company's common stock when shareholders are trying to sell their shares.\nThe Company may not be able to reach acceptable terms for contracts negotiated with its labor unions and be subject to work stoppages or disruption of production.\nDuring 2018, union contracts covering approximately 9% of the Company's total workforce will expire. The Company has been successful in negotiating new contracts over the years, but cannot guarantee that will continue. Failure to negotiate new union contracts could result in the disruption of production, inability to deliver product or a number of unforeseen circumstances, any of which could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.\nDeterioration in the creditworthiness of several major customers could have a material impact on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIncluded as a significant asset on the Company's balance sheet are accounts receivable from our customers. If several large customers become insolvent or are otherwise unable to pay for products, or become unwilling or unable to make payments in a timely manner, it could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.\nAlthough the Company is not dependent on any one customer, deterioration in several large customers at the same time could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial condition. No one customer exceeded 10% of total accounts receivable for 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nThe Company's operating results may fluctuate, which makes the results of operations difficult to predict and could cause the results to fall short of expectations.\nThe Company's operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing the Company's operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and past results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Quarterly, year to date and annual costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues may differ significantly from historical or projected levels. Future operating results may fall below expectations. These types of events could cause the price of the Company's stock to fall.\nNew or existing U.S. or foreign laws could subject the Company to claims or otherwise impact the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of laws in both the U.S. and foreign countries that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and can subject the Company to claims or other remedies.", "PERMNO": 31480, "SIC": 3420, "TIC": "EML"}
