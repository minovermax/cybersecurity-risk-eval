RISK FACTORS\nThe following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risk factors should be considered along with the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these factors could cause our actual results or financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. The following discussion is not an all-inclusive listing of risks, although we believe these are the more material risks that we face. If any of the following occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nBusiness and Economic Risks\nWe are affected by general economic conditions, particularly fluctuations in industrial production and consumption, and an economic downturn could adversely affect business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe sell chemicals that are used in manufacturing processes and as components of or ingredients in other products. Our sales are correlated with and affected by fluctuations in the levels of industrial production, manufacturing output, and general economic activity. For example, demand for our oil, gas and mining products and services is affected by factors such as the level of exploration, drilling, development and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil, gas and mining companies and oilfield service providers, and trends in oil, gas and mineral prices. Additionally, the increasing focus on the potential effects of climate change could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of drilling programs or development or production activities by fossil-fuel providers, which would curtail the supply of various organic chemicals that we distribute to a broad array of end markets. Producers of commodity and specialty chemicals are likely to reduce their output in periods of significant contraction in industrial and consumer demand, while demand for the products we distribute depends largely on trends in demand in the end markets our customers serve. A majority of our sales are in North America and Europe and our business is therefore susceptible to downturns in those economies as well as, to a lesser extent, the economies in the rest of the world.\nOur profit margins, as well as overall demand for our products and services, could decline as a result of a large number of factors outside our control, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic recessions, reduced customer demand (whether due to changes in production processes, consumer preferences, the industries in which the customer operates, laws and regulations affecting the chemicals industry and the manner in which they are enforced, or other factors), inflation, fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates, and changes in the fiscal or monetary policies of governments in the regions in which we operate. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic caused growth in certain of our end markets such as in Homecare and Industrial Cleaning and Pharmaceuticals, while other end markets such as the upstream refining market, remained depressed.\nGeneral economic conditions and macroeconomic trends, as well as the creditworthiness of our customers, could affect overall demand for chemicals. Any overall decline in the demand for chemicals could significantly reduce our sales and profitability. If the creditworthiness of our customers declines, we would face increased credit risk. In addition, volatility and\ndisruption in financial markets could adversely affect our sales and results of operations by limiting our customers\u2019 ability to obtain financing necessary to maintain or expand their own operations.\nA historical feature of past economic weakness has been significant destocking of inventories, including inventories of chemicals used in industrial and manufacturing processes. It is possible that an improvement in our net sales in a particular period may be attributable in part to restocking of inventories by our customers and represent a level of sales or sales growth that will not be sustainable over the longer term. Further economic weakness could lead to insolvencies among our customers or producers, as well as among financial institutions that are counterparties on financial instruments or accounts that we hold. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe novel coronavirus identified in China in late 2019 has spread globally and has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, including travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns. These measures have adversely impacted and may further adversely impact our workforce and operations and those of our customers, vendors and suppliers by, among other things, causing facility closures, production delays and capacity limitations; disrupting our supply chain and reducing the availability of products; straining our supply chain as a result of increased demand for certain of our products; reducing the demand for certain of our products; affecting the collectability of our accounts receivable; disrupting the transport of products from our supply chain to us and from us to our customers and causing delays; restricting our operations and sales, marketing and distribution efforts; and delaying the implementation of our strategic plans and initiatives. For additional disclosures on the effect of the pandemic on our business, see \"Market Conditions and Outlook\" in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused disruption in the capital markets and could make financing more difficult and/or expensive to obtain in the short term. To the extent that the Company and its employees, customers, vendors and suppliers continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, this could materially interrupt the Company\u2019s business operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices (including restricting employee travel, changing employee work locations, and limiting the use of in-person meetings, events and conferences) and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, vendors and suppliers. Our operations and our ability to perform critical functions may be disrupted if a significant number of employees are ill, quarantined or otherwise limited in their ability to work remotely, such as in the event of a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue, or other event that impacts our employees\u2019 ability to work remotely. The increase in remote working may also result in increased cyber security and fraud risks, as well as a potential loss in productivity.\nAs permitted and where possible, we will endeavor to have our business-critical employees return to working from our offices and facilities, at least partially. This could result in an increased COVID-19 positivity rate amongst our employee population and could result in an increased volume of workers compensation claims. In addition, employee relations challenges may arise as we work to balance business needs with employee preferences on remote working arrangements.\nThe potential duration and impact of the pandemic on the global economy and on our business are difficult to predict and cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty, but the pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty and caused significant disruptions to global financial markets. We might not be able to predict or respond to all impacts on a timely basis to prevent near- or long-term adverse impact to our results.\nSignificant changes in the business strategies of producers or in the operations of our customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant changes in the business strategies of producers could disrupt our supply. Large chemical manufacturers may elect to sell certain products (or products in certain regions) directly to customers or utilize digital marketplaces, bypassing distributors such as us. While we do not believe that our results depend materially on access to any individual producer\u2019s products, a reversal of the trend toward more active use of distributors would likely result in increasing margin pressure or products becoming unavailable to us.\nIn addition, unpredictable events may have a significant impact on the industries in which many of our customers operate, reducing demand for products that we normally distribute in significant volumes. Significant disruptions of supply and disruptions in customer industries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete successfully.\nThe chemical distribution market is highly competitive. Chemicals can be purchased from a variety of sources, including traders, brokers, wholesalers and other distributors, as well as directly from producers. Many of the products we distribute or finish are essentially fungible with products offered by our competition, including emerging competitors. The competitive\npressure we face is particularly strong in sectors and markets where local competitors have strong positions or where new competitors can easily enter. Increased competition from distributors of products similar to or competitive with ours could result in price reductions, reduced margins and a loss of market share.\nWe expect to continue to experience significant and increasing levels of competition in the future. We must also compete with smaller companies that have been able to develop strong local or regional customer bases. In certain countries, some of our competitors are more established, benefit from greater name recognition and have greater resources within those countries than we do.\nConsolidation of our competitors in the markets in which we operate could place us at a competitive disadvantage and reduce our profitability.\nWe operate in an industry, which is highly fragmented on a global scale, but in which there has been a trend toward consolidation in recent years. Consolidation of our competitors may also further enhance their financial position, provide them with the ability to offer more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete, and allow them to achieve increased efficiencies in their consolidated operations that enable them to more effectively compete for customers. This may jeopardize the strength of our positions in one or more of the markets in which we operate and any advantages we currently enjoy due to the comparative scale of our operations. Losing some of those advantages could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our growth potential.\nThe prices and costs of the products we purchase may be subject to large and significant price increases. We might not be able to pass such cost increases through to our customers. We could experience financial losses if our inventories of one or more chemicals exceed our sales and the price of those chemicals decreases significantly while in our inventories or if our inventories fall short of our sales and the purchase price of those chemicals increases significantly.\nWe purchase and sell a wide variety of chemicals, the price and availability of which may fluctuate, and may be subject to large and significant price increases. Many of our contracts with producers include chemical prices that are not fixed or are tied to an index, which allows our producers to change the prices of the chemicals we purchase as the price of the chemicals fluctuates in the market. Changes in chemical prices affect our net sales and cost of goods sold, as well as our working capital requirements, levels of debt and financing costs. We might not always be able to reflect increases in our chemical costs, transportation costs and other costs in our own pricing. Any inability to pass cost increases onto customers may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn order to meet customer demand, we typically maintain significant inventories, and we are therefore subject to a number of risks associated with our inventory levels, including the following:\n\u2022declines in the prices of chemicals that are held by us;\n\u2022the need to maintain a significant inventory of chemicals that may be in limited supply and therefore difficult to procure;\n\u2022buying chemicals in bulk for the best pricing and thereby holding excess inventory;\n\u2022responding to the fluctuating demand for chemicals;\n\u2022cancellation of customer orders; and\n\u2022responding to customer requests for rapid delivery.\nIn order to manage our inventories successfully, we must estimate demand from our customers and purchase chemicals that substantially correspond to that demand. If we overestimate demand and purchase too much of a particular chemical, we face a risk that the price of that chemical will fall, leaving us with inventory that we cannot sell profitably or have to write down such inventory from its recorded value. If we underestimate demand and purchase insufficient quantities of a particular chemical and prices of that chemical rise, we could be forced to purchase that chemical at a higher price and forego profitability in order to meet customer demand. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer a material adverse effect if either or both of these situations occur frequently or in large volumes.\nWe require significant working capital, and we expect our working capital needs to increase in the future, which could result in having lower cash available for, among other things, capital expenditures and acquisition financing.\nWe require significant working capital to purchase chemicals from chemical producers and distributors and sell those chemicals efficiently and profitably to our customers. Our working capital needs may increase if the price of products we purchase and inventory increase. Our working capital needs also increase at certain times of the year, as our customers\u2019 requirements for chemicals increase. We need inventory on hand to have product available to ensure timely delivery to our customers. If our working capital requirements increase and we are unable to finance our working capital on terms and conditions acceptable to us, we may not be able to obtain chemicals to respond to customer demand, which could result in a loss of sales.\nIn addition, the amount of working capital we require to run our business is expected to increase in the future due to expansions in our business activities. If our working capital needs increase, the amount of free cash we have at our disposal to devote to other uses will decrease. A decrease in free cash could, among other things, limit our flexibility, including our ability to make capital expenditures and to acquire suitable acquisition targets that we have identified. If increases in our working capital occur and have the effect of decreasing our free cash, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on transportation assets, some of which we do not own, in order to deliver products to our customers.\nAlthough we maintain a significant portfolio of owned and leased transportation assets, including trucks, trailers and rail cars, we also rely on transportation and warehousing provided by third parties (including common carriers and rail companies) to deliver products to our customers. Our access to third party transportation is not guaranteed, and we may be unable to transport chemicals at economically attractive rates in certain circumstances, particularly in cases of adverse market conditions or disruptions to transportation infrastructure. We are also subject to increased costs that we may not always be able to recover from our customers, including fuel prices, as well as charges imposed by common carriers, leasing companies and other third parties involved in transportation.\nAccidents, safety failures, environmental damage, product quality issues, delivery failures or hazards and risks relate to our operations and the hazardous materials we blend, manage, handle, store, sell, transport or dispose of could damage our reputation and result in substantial damages or remedial obligations.\nOur business depends to a significant extent on our customers\u2019 and producers\u2019 trust in our reputation for reliability, quality, safety and environmental responsibility. Actual or alleged instances of safety deficiencies, mistaken or incorrect deliveries, inferior product quality, exposure to hazardous materials resulting in illness, injury or other harm to persons, property or natural resources, or of damage caused by us or our products, could damage our reputation and lead to customers and producers curtailing the volume of business they do with us. Also, there may be safety, personal injury or other environmental risks related to our products which are not known today. Any of these events, outcomes or allegations could also subject us to substantial legal claims, and we could incur substantial expenses, including legal fees and other costs, in defending such legal claims, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nActual or alleged accidents or other incidents at our facilities or that otherwise involve our personnel or operations could also subject us to claims for damages by third parties. Because many of the chemicals that we handle are dangerous, we are subject to the ongoing risk of hazards, including leaks, spills, releases, explosions and fires, which may cause property damage, illness, physical injury or death. We sell products used in hydraulic fracturing, a process that involves injecting water, sand and chemicals into subsurface rock formations to release and capture oil and natural gas. The use of such hydraulic fracturing fluids by our customers may result in releases that could impact the environment and third parties. Several of our distribution facilities are located near high-density population centers. If any such events occur, whether through our own fault, through preexisting conditions at our facilities, through the fault of a third party or through a natural disaster, terrorist incident or other event outside our control, our reputation could be damaged significantly. We could also become responsible, as a result of environmental or other laws or by court order, for substantial monetary damages or expensive investigative or remedial obligations related to such events, including but not limited to those resulting from third party lawsuits or environmental investigation and cleanup obligations on and off-site. The amount of any costs, including fines, damages and/or investigative and remedial obligations, that we may become obligated to pay under such circumstances could substantially exceed any insurance we have to cover such losses.\nAny of these risks, if they materialize, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business exposes us to significant risks, not all of which are covered by insurance.\nBecause we are engaged in the blending, managing, handling, storing, selling, transporting and disposing of chemicals, chemical waste products and other hazardous materials, product liability, health impacts, fire damage, safety, cyber security and environmental risks are significant concerns for us. We are also exposed to present and future chemical exposure claims by employees, contractors on our premises, other persons located nearby, as well as related workers' compensation claims. Although we carry insurance to protect us against many risks involved in the conduct of our business, we do not insure against all such risks and the insurance we carry is subject to limitations, including exclusions, deductibles and coverage limits. Due to the variable condition of the insurance market, we have experienced and may experience in the future, increased deductible retention levels and increased premiums. We also may be unable to obtain at commercially reasonable rates in the future adequate insurance coverage for the risks we currently insure against, and certain risks are or could become completely uninsurable or eligible for coverage only to a reduced extent. Increased insurance premiums or the occurrence of significant uncovered losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur balance sheet includes significant goodwill and intangible assets, the impairment of which could affect our future financial condition and results of operations.\nWe carry significant goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2020, our goodwill and intangible assets totaled approximately $2.3 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively. At least annually, the Company assesses goodwill for impairment. If testing indicates that goodwill is impaired, the carrying value is written down based on fair value with a charge against earnings. Where the Company utilizes a discounted cash flow methodology in determining fair value, weakened demand for a specific product line or business could result in an impairment. Intangible assets are amortized for book purposes over their respective useful lives and are tested for impairment if any event occurs or circumstances change that indicates that carrying value may not be recoverable. Accordingly, any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could negatively impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cNote 15: Goodwill and intangible assets\u201d in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our 2020 impairment review.\nWe have in the past and may in the future make acquisitions, ventures and strategic investments, some of which may be significant in size and scope, which have involved in the past and will likely involve in the future numerous risks. We may not be able to address these risks without substantial expense, delay or other operational or financial problems.\nAcquisitions or investments have involved in the past and will likely involve in the future various risks, such as:\n\u2022integrating the technologies, operations and personnel of any acquired business;\n\u2022the potential disruption of our ongoing business, including the diversion of management attention;\n\u2022the possible inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment;\n\u2022customer attrition arising from preferences to maintain redundant sources of supply;\n\u2022producer attrition arising from overlapping or competitive products;\n\u2022assumption of contingent or unanticipated liabilities or regulatory liabilities;\n\u2022dependence on the retention and performance of existing management and work force of acquired businesses for the future performance of these businesses;\n\u2022regulatory risks associated with acquired businesses (including the risk that we may be required for regulatory reasons to dispose of a portion of our existing or acquired businesses); and\n\u2022the risks inherent in entering geographic or product markets in which we have limited prior experience.\nFuture acquisitions and investments may need to be financed in part through additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or through other arrangements, and could result in substantial cash expenditures. The necessary acquisition financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms if and when required, particularly if our debt leverage levels make it difficult or impossible for us to secure additional financing for acquisitions.\nRisks Related to Technology\nOur business could be seriously impacted by business disruptions and security breaches, including cybersecurity incidents.\nBusiness and/or supply chain disruptions, plant downtime, and/or power outages, and information technology system and/or network disruptions, regardless of cause, including acts of sabotage, employee error or other actions, geo-political activity, military actions, terrorism (including cyber-attacks), weather events, and natural disasters could seriously harm our operations as well as the operations of our customers and suppliers. Any such event could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nCyber-attacks or security breaches could compromise confidential, business critical information, cause a disruption in the Company\u2019s operations or harm the Company\u2019s reputation. Additionally, the increase in remote working as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic may also result in increased cyber-security and fraud risks. While the Company has a comprehensive cyber-security program that is continuously reviewed, maintained and upgraded, there can be no assurance that such procedures, controls, and intelligence will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. If any security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and could result in claims being brought against us.\nThe integration of our business systems may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are currently in the process of integrating our legacy business systems into the legacy Nexeo business systems (the \u201cSystems Integration\u201d). The Systems Integration is anticipated to be completed by year end of 2021. Since we will process and reconcile our information from multiple systems until the Systems Integration is complete, the chance of errors is greater. Inconsistencies in the information from multiple systems could adversely impact our ability to manage our business efficiently\nand may result in heightened risk to our ability to maintain our books and records and comply with regulatory requirements. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the Systems Integration could adversely affect our ability to process orders, track inventory, ship products in a timely manner, prepare invoices to our customers, maintain regulatory compliance and otherwise carry on our business in the ordinary course. The Systems Integration involves numerous risks, including:\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention away from normal daily business operations;\n\u2022loss of, or delays in accessing, data;\n\u2022increased demand on our operations support personnel;\n\u2022initial dependence on unfamiliar systems while training personnel to use new systems; and\n\u2022increased operating expenses resulting from training, conversion and transition support activities.\nAny of the foregoing could result in a material increase in information technology compliance or other related costs, and could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur indebtedness may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $2,640.6 million of total debt. Our indebtedness may have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and operating results. The amount of our debt, as well as any additional debt or other obligations that we may incur in the future, could have important consequences for holders of our common stock, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022our ability to satisfy obligations to lenders or note holders may be impaired, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of our indebtedness;\n\u2022our ability to obtain additional financing for refinancing of existing indebtedness, working capital, capital expenditures, product and service development, acquisitions, general corporate purposes and other purposes may be impaired;\n\u2022our assets that currently serve as collateral for our debt may be insufficient, or may not be available, to support future financings;\n\u2022a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be used to repay the principal and interest on our debt;\n\u2022we may be increasingly vulnerable to economic downturns and increases in interest rates;\n\u2022our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we operate may be limited; and\n\u2022we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry with less debt or comparable debt at more favorable interest rates.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain operating covenants and restrictions that limit our operations and could lead to adverse consequences if we fail to comply with them.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain certain operating covenants and other restrictions relating to, among other things, limitations on indebtedness (including guarantees of additional indebtedness) and liens, mergers, consolidations and dissolutions, sales of assets, investments and acquisitions, dividends and other restricted payments, repurchase of shares of capital stock and options to purchase shares of capital stock and certain transactions with affiliates. In addition, our North American ABL Facility and Euro ABL Facility include certain financial covenants.\nFailure to comply with these financial and operating covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the pricing of our products, our success at implementing cost reduction initiatives, our ability to successfully implement our overall business strategy or changes in general economic conditions, which may be beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the agreements that govern these facilities that would permit the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If we are unable to repay such amounts, lenders having secured obligations could proceed against the collateral securing these obligations. This could have serious consequences on our financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or otherwise insolvent. In addition, these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that we believe would otherwise be in the best interests of our business and stockholders. We may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to additional restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility.\nIncreases in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability.\nCertain of our outstanding debt bears interest at variable rates. As a result, increases in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. Approximately $1.9 billion, or 72 percent of our debt is indexed to LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate and we may hold other operational contracts, including leases, that are also indexed to LIBOR. In July 2017, The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR,\nannounced that it intends to phase out all LIBOR tenors by the end of 2021. However, in late 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration announced that certain tenors of LIBOR may be extended until mid-2023. At this time, it is uncertain if applicable tenors of LIBOR will cease to exist after calendar year 2021, or whether additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted, or whether alternative reference rates will gain market acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to amend our debt and other certain agreements that use LIBOR as a benchmark and we cannot predict what alternative index or other amendments may be negotiated with our counterparties. As a result, our interest or operating expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. For additional information on our indebtedness, debt service obligations and sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations, see \u201cQualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d in Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe have historically relied on debt financing to fund our operations, capital expenditures and expansion. The macroeconomic conditions that affect the markets in which we operate and our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to secure financing on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption in the capital markets and could make financing more difficult and/or expensive to obtain in the short term. The terms of additional financing may limit our financial and operating flexibility, and if financing is not available when needed, or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.\nLitigation, Environmental and Regulatory Risk\nAs a result of our current and past operations, we are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which expose us to risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions because we blend, manage, handle, store, sell, transport and arrange for the disposal of chemicals, hazardous materials and hazardous waste. These include laws and regulations governing our management, storage, transportation and disposal of chemicals; product regulation; air, water and soil contamination; greenhouse gas emissions; and the investigation and cleanup of contaminated sites, including any spills or releases that may result from our management, handling, storage, sale, or transportation of chemicals and other products. Compliance with these laws and regulations, and with the permits and licenses we hold, requires that we expend significant amounts for ongoing compliance, investigation and remediation. If we fail to comply with such laws, regulations, permits or licenses, we may be subject to fines, damages and other civil, administrative or criminal sanctions and investigations, including the revocation of permits and licenses necessary to continue our business activities. In addition, future changes in laws and regulations, or the interpretation of existing laws and regulations, could have an adverse effect on us by adding restrictions, reducing our ability to do business, increasing our costs of doing business, reducing our profitability or reducing the demand for our products.\nPrevious operations, including those of acquired companies, have resulted in contamination at a number of current and former sites, which must be investigated and remediated. We have ongoing investigations and remediation activities, or are contributing to cleanup costs, at approximately 104 currently or formerly owned, operated or used sites or other sites impacted by our operations. We have spent substantial sums on such investigation and remediation and we expect to continue to incur such expenditures in the future. We may incur losses in connection with investigation and remediation obligations that exceed our environmental reserve. There is no guarantee that our estimates will be accurate, that new contamination will not be discovered or that new environmental laws or regulations will not require us to incur additional costs. Any such inaccuracies, discoveries or new laws or regulations, or the interpretation of existing laws and regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be held liable for the costs to investigate, remediate or otherwise address contamination at any real property we have ever owned, leased, operated or used or other sites impacted by our operations. Some environmental laws could impose on us the entire cost of cleanup of contamination present at a site even though we did not cause all of the contamination. These laws often identify parties who can be strictly and jointly and severally liable for remediation. The discovery of previously unknown contamination at current or former sites or the imposition of other environmental liabilities or obligations in the future, including additional investigation or remediation obligations with respect to contamination that has impacted other properties, could lead to additional costs or the need for additional reserves that have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be required to pay damages or civil judgments related to third party claims, including those relating to personal injury (including exposure to hazardous materials or chemicals we blend, handle, store, sell, transport or dispose of), product quality issues, property damage or contribution to remedial obligations. We\nhave been identified as a potentially responsible party at certain third party sites at which we have arranged for the disposal of our hazardous wastes. We may be identified as a potentially responsible party at additional sites beyond those for which we currently have financial obligations. Such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSocietal concerns regarding the safety of chemicals in commerce and their potential impact on the environment have resulted in a growing trend towards increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection regulations. These concerns could influence public perceptions, impact the commercial viability of the products we sell and increase the costs to comply with increasingly complex regulations, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional findings by government agencies that chemicals pose significant environmental, health or safety risks may lead to their prohibition in some or all of the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability claims and recalls, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe repackaging, blending, mixing, manufacture, sale and distribution of chemical products by us, including products used in hydraulic fracturing operations and products produced with food ingredients or with pharmaceutical and nutritional supplement applications, involve an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims, product recalls, product seizures and related adverse publicity, including, without limitation, claims for exposure to our products, spills or releases of our products, personal injuries, food related claims and property damage or environmental claims. A product liability claim, judgment or recall against our customers could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures for us, affect confidence in our products or services and divert management\u2019s attention from other responsibilities. Although we maintain product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that the type or level of coverage is adequate or that we will be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all. A product recall or a partially or completely uninsured judgment against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nMany of the products we sell have \u201clong-tail\u201d exposures, giving rise to liabilities many years after their sale and use. Insurance purchased at the time of sale may not be available when costs arise in the future and producers may no longer be available to provide indemnification.\nInternational Market Risk\nOur results of operations could suffer if we are unable to expand into new geographic markets or manage the various risks related to our international activities.\nOur profitability and longer-term success may be adversely affected if we fail to continue to expand our penetration in certain foreign markets and to enter new and emerging foreign markets. The profitability of our international operations will largely depend on our continued success in the following areas:\n\u2022securing key producer relationships to help establish our presence in international markets;\n\u2022hiring and training personnel capable of supporting producers and our customers and managing operations in foreign countries;\n\u2022localizing our business processes to meet the specific needs and preferences of foreign producers and customers;\n\u2022building our reputation and awareness of our services among foreign producers and customers; and\n\u2022implementing new financial, management information and operational systems, procedures and controls to monitor our operations in new markets effectively, without causing undue disruptions to our operations and customer and producer relationships.\nIn addition, we are subject to risks associated with operating in foreign countries, including:\n\u2022varying and often unclear legal and regulatory requirements that may be subject to inconsistent or disparate enforcement, particularly regarding environmental, health and safety issues and security or other certification requirements, as well as other laws and business practices that favor local competitors, such as exposure to possible expropriation, nationalization, restrictions on investments by foreign companies or other governmental actions;\n\u2022less stable supply sources;\n\u2022competition from existing market participants that may have a longer history in and greater familiarity with the foreign markets where we operate;\n\u2022tariffs, export duties, quotas and other barriers to trade; as well as possible limitations on the conversion of foreign currencies into US dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries;\n\u2022divergent labor regulations and cultural expectations regarding employment and agency;\n\u2022different cultural expectations regarding industrialization, international business and business relationships;\n\u2022foreign taxes and related regulations, including foreign taxes that we may not be able to offset against taxes imposed upon us in the US, and foreign tax and other laws limiting our ability to repatriate earnings to the US;\n\u2022extended payment terms and challenges in our ability to collect accounts receivable;\n\u2022changes in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions;\n\u2022compliance with anti-bribery laws such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, the violation of which could expose us to severe criminal or civil sanctions; and\n\u2022compliance with anti-boycott, privacy, economic sanctions, anti-dumping, antitrust, import and export laws and regulations by our employees or intermediaries acting on our behalf, the violation of which could expose us to significant fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have sizable sales and operations in Canada, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. We report our consolidated results in US dollars and the results of operations and the financial position of our local operations are generally reported in the relevant local currencies and then translated into US dollars at the applicable exchange rates. As a result, our financial performance is impacted by currency fluctuations. For additional details on our currency exposure and risk management practices, see \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d in Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEmployee and Benefit Plan Risk\nNegative developments affecting our pension and multi-employer pension plans in which we participate may occur.\nWe operate a number of pension and post-retirement plans for our employees and have obligations with respect to several multi-employer pension plans sponsored by labor unions in the US. The terms of these plans vary from country to country. The recognition of costs and liabilities associated with the pension and postretirement plans is affected by assumptions made by management and used by actuaries engaged by us to calculate the benefit obligations and the expenses recognized for these plans. The inputs used in developing the required estimates are calculated using a number of assumptions, which represent management\u2019s best estimate of the future. The assumptions that have the most significant impact on costs and liabilities are the discount rate, the estimated long-term return on plan assets for the funded plans, retirement rates, and mortality rates. Changes to the funded status of our pension plans as a result of updates to actuarial assumptions and actual experience that differs from our estimates are recognized as gains or losses in the period incurred under our \u201cmark to market\u201d accounting policy, and could result in a requirement for additional funding.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our pension plans were underfunded by $228.9 million and our unfunded postretirement plan liabilities were approximately $1.6 million. In recent years, declining interest rates have negatively impacted the funded status of our pension and postretirement plans. If the interest rates continue to decline, funding requirements for our pension plans may become more significant. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our obligations under these pension and postretirement plans, we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, seek additional capital, or incur indebtedness.\nThe union sponsored multi-employer pension plans in which we participate are also underfunded, including the substantially underfunded Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan, which have liabilities that exceed its assets. Often, this requires us to make substantial withdrawal liability payments when we close a facility covered by one of these plans, which could hinder our ability to make otherwise appropriate management decisions to operate as efficiently as possible.\nA portion of our workforce is unionized and labor disruptions could decrease our profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 24% of our labor force is covered by a collective bargaining agreement, including approximately 12%, 46% and 23% of our labor force in the US, Europe and Canada, respectively. Approximately 4% of our labor force is covered by a collective bargaining agreement that will expire within one year. These arrangements grant certain protections to employees and subject us to employment terms that are similar to collective bargaining agreements. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to negotiate these or other collective bargaining agreements or arrangements with works councils on the same or more favorable terms as the current agreements or arrangements, or at all, and without interruptions, including labor stoppages at the facility or facilities subject to any particular agreement or arrangement. A prolonged labor dispute, which could include a work stoppage, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws include a number of provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. For example, our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws currently:\n\u2022authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022limit the ability of stockholders to remove directors; and\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt or before our Board becomes fully declassified, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if the provisions are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. Our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions may facilitate management entrenchment that may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to additional general regulatory requirements, which increase our cost of doing business, could result in claims and enforcement actions, and could restrict our business in the future.\nOur general business operations are subject to a broad spectrum of international, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those relating to antitrust, environmental, food and drug, labor and human resources, tax, trade compliance, unclaimed property, transportation, anti-bribery, banking and treasury, privacy and data protection (including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation), among others. These laws and regulations add cost to our conduct of business and could, in some instances, result in claims or enforcement actions or could reduce our ability to pursue business opportunities. Any changes in the laws and regulations applicable to us, the enactment of any additional laws or regulations, or the failure to comply with, or increased enforcement activity of, such laws and regulations, could significantly impact our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, governmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our operating licenses and permits.\nWe are exposed to litigation and other legal and regulatory actions and risks in the ordinary course of our business, and we could incur significant liabilities and substantial legal fees.\nWe are subject to the risk of litigation, other legal claims and proceedings, and regulatory enforcement actions in the ordinary course of our business. Also, there may be safety or personal injury risks related to our products which are not known today. The results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. We cannot guarantee that the results of current or future legal proceedings will not materially harm our business, reputation or brand, nor can we guarantee that we will not incur losses in connection with current or future legal proceedings that exceed any provisions we may have set aside in respect of such proceedings or that exceed any applicable insurance coverage. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe depend on a limited number of key personnel who would be difficult to replace. If we lose the services of these individuals, or are unable to attract new talent, our business will be adversely affected.\nWe depend upon the ability and experience of a number of our executive management and other key personnel who have substantial experience with our operations, the chemicals and chemical distribution industries and the selected markets in which we operate. The loss of the services of one or a combination of our senior executives or key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We also might suffer an additional impact on our business if one of our senior executives or key employees is hired by a competitor.", "PERMNO": 15482, "SIC": 5160, "TIC": "UNVR"}
