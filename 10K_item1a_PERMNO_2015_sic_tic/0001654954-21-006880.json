Risk Factors\nThe risks and uncertainties described in the risk factors below are those that we currently consider material, and the statements contained elsewhere in this annual report, including our financial statements, should be read together with these risk factors. The occurrence of any of, or a combination of, the following risks or uncertainties, or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, liquidity, cash flows, or reputation.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of some of the principal risks that could affect our businesses and should be read with the more complete discussion of risks and uncertainties set forth below it.\nRisks Related to the U.S. and International Securities Brokerage and Banking Industry:\n\u00b7\nWe operate in highly regulated industries.\n\u00b7\nAs a U.S. public company listed on Nasdaq we are subject to resource intensive obligations.\n\u00b7\nWe are subject to risks related to anti-corruption laws in effect in the United States and the non-U.S. jurisdictions where we conduct business.\n\u00b7\nNon-compliance with U.S., EU or other sanctions programs or an expansion of these programs could adversely impact our business.\n\u00b7\nThe countries in which we operate have changing regulatory regimes, regulatory policies, and interpretations.\n\u00b7\nWe are subject to risks of litigation, administrative and regulatory action arising from our operating activities.\nRisks Related to Our Securities and Banking

losses from credit exposures.\n\u00b7\nOur investments can expose us to a significant risk of capital loss.\n\u00b7\nWe may need to raise additional capital, and we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available or available on attractive terms.\n\u00b7\nWe are dependent upon our relationships with U.S. securities broker-dealer and clearing firms to receive and transmit funds internationally.\n\u00b7\nWe derive a majority of our commission revenue from a related party brokerage firm and regional regulatory changes might create conflict of interest, direct competition, and reduced commission revenue from that brokerage.\n\u00b7\nWe may suffer significant loss from changes in the KASE\u2019s requirements related to the discount coefficients on the securities in securities repurchase transactions.\nGeographic, Currency and Political Risks:\n\u00b7\nWe face risks relating to doing business in some Eurasian markets and consumer financial services sectors within those markets.\n\u00b7\nThe Russian political regime poses special challenges which could impact adversely our major business commitments and activities in country.\n\u00b7\nWe are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation risks.\n\u00b7\nWe face interest rate change risks.\n\u00b7\nDeterioration of Russia\u2019s relations with other countries could negatively affect the economies of Russia and the neighboring countries in which our subsidiaries operate.\nTaxation Risks Related to our International Operations:\n\u00b7\nGlobal anti-offshore measures could adversely impact our business.\n\u00b7\nFrequent changes in the Russian tax system could affect our business in and the value of our investments in Russia.\n\u00b7\nRussian and Cypriot transfer pricing legislation may require pricing adjustments and impose additional tax liabilities.\n\u00b7\nRussian anti-offshore measures expose us to tax liability risks.\n\u00b7\nUncertainties and ongoing changes in Kazakhstan\u2019s tax regime may have an adverse impact on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure and Internal Operations:\n\u00b7\nWe are a diversified holding company with few operations of our own and are reliant on the operations of our subsidiaries to fund holding company operations.\n\u00b7\nAs a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under Nasdaq rules we are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements that may adversely affect our stock price.\n\u00b7\nTimur Turlov has control over key decision making.\n\u00b7\nWe are dependent on our executive management team, particularly Timur Turlov, and our ability to hire and retain skilled personnel.\n\u00b7\nWe anticipate that acquisitions will continue to play a key role in our growth strategy, but we may be unable to identify, acquire, close or integrate acquisition targets successfully.\nRisks Related to Information Technology and Cyber Security:\n\u00b7\nOur broker-dealer, financial services, and banking operations are highly dependent on the continued and proper functioning of our information technology systems and particularly \u201cTradernet\u201d, our proprietary electronic trading platform.\n\u00b7\nOur electronic trading platform \u201cTradernet\u201d is subject to competition risks.\n\u00b7\nWe interact with large volumes of sensitive data that exposes us to IT breach and other data security risks and liabilities.\n\u00b7\nThe infrastructure on which our IT systems depend, and particularly those in the emerging markets of our subsidiaries, are subject to events that could interrupt our ability operate.\n\u00b7\nFailure of third-party systems and operations on which we rely could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities:\n\u00b7\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated historically and may be volatile.\n\u00b7\nFuture offerings of securities which would rank senior to our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n\u00b7\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future and, consequently, our stockholders\u2019 ability to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nGeneral Business Risks:\n\u00b7\nOur business is affected by general business and economic conditions and securities market performance, and those in the particular countries in which we operate.\n\u00b7\nUnforeseen or catastrophic events, including pandemics, terrorist attacks, extreme weather events or other natural disasters or political discord could negatively impact our business.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic:\n\u00b7\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and will likely continue to impact the global economy, global financial markets and our business financial condition and results of operations.\nCredit Related Risks:\n\u00b7\nOur businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by disruptions or lack of liquidity in the credit markets, including reduced access to credit and higher costs of obtaining credit.\n\u00b7\nReductions in our credit ratings or an increase in our credit spreads may adversely affect our liquidity and cost of funding.\nRisks Related to the U.S. and International Securities Brokerage and Banking Industries\nWe operate in highly regulated industries.\nThe business of the Company and its subsidiaries is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight in multiple jurisdictions. This includes but is not limited to laws, regulations and rules or other obligations concerning:\n\u2022\nsecurities brokerage\n\u2022\nsecurities trading\n\u2022\ninvestment banking\n\u2022\ncommercial banking\n\u2022\ncredit\n\u2022\ndeposit taking\n\u2022\nmargin lending\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange\n\u2022\nprivacy\n\u2022\ncross-border and domestic money transmission\n\u2022\ncyber security\n\u2022\ndata governance\n\u2022\nfraud detection\n\u2022\ndata protection\n\u2022\nantitrust and competition\n\u2022\nbanking secrecy\n\u2022\nconsumer protection\n\u2022\npayment services (including payment\n\u2022\nanti-money laundering\nprocessing and settlement services)\n\u2022\ncounter-terrorist financing\n\u2022\neconomic and trade sanctions\nFailure to comply with these often complex and frequently changing legal obligations could materially harm our business.\nAs the Company and/or its subsidiaries introduce new products and services, expand existing product and service offerings and/or acquire new businesses they may be subject to additional regulations, restrictions, and licensing requirements and related regulatory oversight. Similarly, as the Company expands its international activities, it will be obligated to be aware of, comprehend and comply with the laws of the new markets and jurisdictions in which it operates.\nFurther, the various jurisdictions in which the Company\u2019s subsidiaries operate may impose different or even conflicting obligations than those applicable to the Company or other subsidiaries. For example, laws regulating the internet, mobile, and related technologies used by the Company\u2019s subsidiaries outside of the U.S. often impose different, more specific, or even conflicting obligations, as well as broader liability. In addition, certain transactions that may be prohibited by economic sanctions regulations of U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) if undertaken by the Company or in the United States may be permissible if undertaken independently by a non-U.S. subsidiary where there is no U.S. nexus.\nA failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders of any cognizant government authority may subject the Company or its subsidiaries to investigation, which may involve extensive legal-related costs. A finding of noncompliance could result in criminal or civil enforcement in one or more jurisdictions leading to significant fines or penalties, including forfeiture of assets; result in additional compliance and licensure requirements; result in loss of existing licenses or prevent or delay obtaining additional licenses that may be required for our business; increase regulatory scrutiny; restrict our operations or require that we change certain business practices, make product or operational changes; increase expenses; and delay planned transactions, product launches or improvements. Any of the foregoing could, individually or in the aggregate, harm our reputation, damage our brands and business, and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The Company and its subsidiaries have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but notwithstanding these measures it is possible that our employees, contractors, and agents could nevertheless breach such laws and regulations.\nAs a U.S. public company listed on Nasdaq, we are subject to resource intensive obligations.\nWe are subject to extensive corporate governance, reporting and accounting disclosure requirements under U.S. securities laws and regulations of the SEC. These laws, as well as the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange, impose certain compliance requirements, costs and obligations on listed companies. This requires a significant commitment of resources and management oversight. The expenses associated with being a public company include auditing, accounting and legal fees and expenses, investor relations expenses, increased directors\u2019 fees, registrar and transfer agent fees and listing fees, as well as other expenses. Failure to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley Act or Dodd-Frank Act could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory, exchange or market authorities.\nWe are subject to risks related to anti-corruption laws in effect in the United States and the non-U.S. jurisdictions where we conduct business.\nThe Company is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar non-U.S. anti-corruption laws that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws, with more frequent voluntary self-disclosures by companies, aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings, resulting in record fines and penalties, increased enforcement activity, and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals.\nThe Company operates through subsidiaries in Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, the United States, Germany and Cyprus. Enforcement officials generally interpret anti-corruption laws\u2019 prohibitions to include improper payments to government officials like those of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the Agency for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Center for Coordination and Development of Securities Market of the Republic of Uzbekistan, the National Commission for securities markets of Ukraine and the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission, the principal regulatory bodies that would control and monitor our operations in certain of these countries. Our internal policies and those of our subsidiaries provide for training and compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws and regulations. Despite our training and compliance programs, it is possible that our employees, agents or independent contractors may cause the Company or a subsidiary to violate applicable laws. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees, agents or independent contractors have or may have caused the Company or a subsidiary to violate applicable anti-corruption laws, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be costly and require significant time and attention from senior management. Non-compliance with these laws may result in criminal or civil penalties, which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, the result of operations and cash flows, and reputational damage.\nNon-compliance with U.S., EU or other sanctions programs or an expansion of these programs could adversely impact our business.\nThe U.S. and European Union and other jurisdictions have imposed economic sanctions on certain countries and persons. The Company is committed to compliance with applicable economic sanctions.\nU.S. economic sanctions include prohibitions (\u2018primary\u2019 sanctions) that are generally administered and enforced by OFAC. With the exception of OFAC\u2019s Iran and Cuba sanctions programs these prohibitions apply to U.S. Persons, including companies organized under the laws of the United States and their overseas branches, but do not apply to non-U.S. subsidiaries of U.S. Persons. U.S. economic sanctions also include \u2018secondary\u2019 sanctions that make certain activities of non-U.S. companies sanctionable under U.S. statutes such as the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (\u201cCAATSA\u201d). These sanctions are administered by OFAC and/or the U.S. Department of State. The Company requires its subsidiaries to fully comply with all U.S. primary sanctions that are applicable to such subsidiaries and/or to transactions in which they are involved, and to refrain from participation in any conduct that is sanctionable under U.S. secondary sanctions.\nOf specific relevance to the Company\u2019s operations, the U.S. has imposed primary sanctions on certain Russian and Ukrainian persons and entities in connection with the alleged role of the Russian Federation in events in Eastern Ukraine and Crimea (\u201cUkraine/Russia-related Sanctions\u201d). Among other things these sanctions prohibit dealing in certain debt or equity issued by a number of major state-owned Russian financial institutions and certain state-owned entities in the Russian energy and defense sectors.\nThe Company, which is a U.S. domiciled holding company with limited operations of its own, is obliged to comply with Ukraine/Russia-related Sanctions, but those sanctions do not apply to the fully independent activities of its non-U.S. subsidiaries where there is no U.S. nexus. If, however, the Company were to be determined to have facilitated activities of its subsidiaries that are prohibited under Ukraine/Russia-related Sanctions the Company could be subject to civil or criminal penalties under OFAC regulations.\nIn addition, non-U.S. companies that cause U.S. companies to violate OFAC regulations may be subject to enforcement action and thereby the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. This may occur for example if a Company subsidiary were to process a U.S dollar transaction involving sanctioned securities through the U.S. financial system. The risk of noncompliance may arise in connection with international transactions conducted in U.S. dollars, transfers to or from U.S. bank accounts, or dealings with U.S. broker-dealers.\nIn the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees, agents or independent contractors have or may have caused the Company or a subsidiary to violate applicable economic sanctions laws, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be costly and require significant time and attention from senior management. Non-compliance with these laws may result in criminal or civil penalties, which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, the result of operations and cash flows.\nFinally, should there be a large scale expansion of U.S. sanctions on Russia, private sector financial institutions in Russia or Russian\u2019s banking system it could negatively affect the Company\u2019s Russian subsidiaries by limiting or prohibiting their access to the U.S. financial system or financial markets. Such large scale expansion may also negatively affect the Russian economy and investment climate, and lead to deterioration of the Russian financial markets. The impact of any such expansion would depend on the nature of such sanctions.\nThe countries in which we operate have changing regulatory regimes, regulatory policies, and interpretations.\nThe countries in which we operate have differing, and sometimes conflicting, regulatory regimes governing the delivery of financial services in each country, the transfer of funds to and from such countries, and other aspects of the broker-dealer, finance, investment and banking industries. These provisions were promulgated during changing political circumstances, are continuing to change, and may be relatively untested, particularly insofar as they apply to foreign investments by residents of various countries. Therefore, there may exist little or no administrative or enforcement history or established practice that can aid us in evaluating how the regulatory regimes may impact our operations or our clients. It is possible that governmental policies will change or that new laws and regulations, administrative practices or policies, or interpretations of existing laws and regulations including those governing capital, liquidity, leverage, long-term debt, margin requirements, restrictions on leveraged lending or other business practices, reporting requirements and tax burdens will materially and adversely affect our activities in one or more of the countries where we operate. Further, since the history and practice of industry regulation is limited, our activities may be particularly vulnerable to the decisions and positions of individuals, who may change, be subject to external pressures, or administer policies inconsistently. Internal bureaucratic politics may have unpredictable and negative consequences. If we fail to develop and maintain good working relationships with local regulators, or a local regulator determines that we have violated local laws in a particular market we could realize significant and negative impacts on our businesses in that market and to our reputation generally.\nOur revenue and profitability could be affected by changes to rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally, including changes to the laws governing foreign ownership, electronic commerce, client privacy and security of client data. In addition, changes to laws, rules and regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing laws, rules or regulations, could:\n\u2022\nlimit the lines of business we conduct\n\u2022\ncompel us to terminate certain lines of\n\u2022\nresult in material cost increases\nbusiness in affected jurisdictions\nincluding our cost of capital\n\u2022\notherwise adversely affect our ability to\n\u2022\nrequire us to modify existing business\ncompete effectively with other\npractices\ninstitutions that are not similarly\n\u2022\nforce us to relocate operations or\nimpacted\npersonnel\n\u2022\nrequire us to invest significant\n\u2022\nmake it uneconomic for us to provide\nmanagement attention and resources to\ncertain services in particular countries\nevaluate and make necessary changes\n\u2022\ninfluence how we manage our capital\nto our compliance, risk management,\nand liquidity\ntreasury and operations functions\nChanges in regulations impacting broker-dealers, banks, or market participants, including taxes on stock transfers and other financial transactions, could reduce market transactions and impact our business.\nChanges to laws or regulations, such as tax laws, could also have a disproportionate impact on our business or profitability, based on the way those laws or regulations are applied to us due to our corporate structure. For example, the current U.S. presidential administration has proposed tax policy ideas that if enacted would, among other things, increase the corporate tax rate and the U.S. tax rate on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI). Because of certain tax advantages we realize in certain jurisdiction where we operate, the proposed changes in the GILTI tax rate by the current administration, which has not yet been adopted and may change significantly before being implemented, if at all, could result in significantly higher tax burdens on the Company in the U.S., which could offset some of the favorable tax advantages we realize in some of the jurisdictions where we conduct business.\nWe are subject to risks of litigation, administrative and regulatory action arising from our operating activities.\nWe operate in highly regulated industries and are exposed to significant legal risks. We may be subject to legal claims from our customers and counterparties, as well as regulatory actions brought against us by the regulators and self-regulatory agencies that oversee and regulate the industries in which we operate. From time to time, we have been, and in the future may be subject to investigations, regulatory proceedings, fines and penalties brought by regulators. We may be subject to employment-related claims and disputes with taxing authorities and other claims. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and economic and trade sanctions. Violation of these or similar laws and regulations could result in significant monetary penalties and restrictions on our activities. We could experience negative publicity and reputational damage as a result of future lawsuits, claims or regulatory actions, in addition to potential significant costs incurred to defend ourselves or settling claims, fines, penalties and judgments. This could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Securities and Banking Business Activities\nFailure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect the financial condition and operations of our subsidiaries.\nOur subsidiary companies must meet certain ongoing capital and liquidity standards, which are subject to evolving rules and qualitative judgments by government regulators regarding the adequacy of their capital and internal assessment of their capital needs. These net capital rules may limit the ability of each subsidiary to transfer capital to us. New regulatory capital, liquidity, and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how each subsidiary utilizes its capital and may require us to increase our capital and/or liquidity or to limit our growth. Failure by our subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could adversely affect our liquidity, business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may suffer significant losses from credit exposures.\nOur business is subject to the risk that a customer, counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations, or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate to cover their obligations to us. We are also subject to the same risk in connection with our own failures in connection with our proprietary trading. While we have policies and procedures designed to manage this risk, the policies and procedures may not be fully effective to protect us against the risk of loss. Our exposure results principally from repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, margin lending, clients\u2019 options trading, futures activities, securities lending, our role as counterparty in financial contracts, investing activities, and our proprietary trading.\nWhen we purchase securities on margin, enter into securities repurchase agreements, or trade options or futures, we are subject to the risk that we, or our customers, may default on those obligations when the value of the securities and cash in our own proprietary or in the customers\u2019 accounts falls below the amount of the indebtedness. Abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure to meet margin calls could result in substantial financial losses.\nWe have exposure to credit risk associated with our proprietary investments. Our investments are subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the financial markets\u2019 assessment of credit quality. Loss in securities value can negatively affect our financial performance and earnings if our management determines that such securities are other-than-temporarily-impaired (OTTI). The evaluation of whether OTTI exists is a matter of judgment, which includes the assessment of several factors. If our management determines that a security is OTTI, the cost basis of the security may be adjusted, and a corresponding loss may be recognized in current earnings. Deterioration in the value of securities held in our proprietary portfolio could result in the recognition of future impairment charges. Even if a security is not considered OTTI, if we were forced to sell the security sooner than intended, we may have to recognize an unrealized loss at that time.\nWe rely upon the use of credit arrangements as a significant component of our trading strategy. We are constantly searching for reliable counterparties for such transactions. Our inability to access an adequate pool of quality reliable counterparties to engage with could limit our ability to undertake certain transactions, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur investments can expose us to a significant risk of capital loss.\nWe use a significant portion of our capital to engage in a variety of investment activities for our own account, as well as in our exchange-based market making activities. We have relied on leveraging to increase the size of our proprietary portfolio. As a result, we may face risks of illiquidity, loss of principal and revaluation of assets. The companies in which we invest may concentrate on markets which are or may be disproportionately impacted by pressures in the sectors on which they focus, and their existing business operations or investment strategies may not perform as projected. As a result, we may suffer losses from our investment activities.\nOur proprietary portfolio is leveraged and concentrated in the sovereign debt instruments of a few non-U.S. countries and debt and equities of a number of companies. A consequence of this investment strategy is that our investment returns could be materially and adversely affected if these investments do not perform as anticipated or if the market performs differently than we forecast. Moreover, because we rely on leverage in our portfolio, when an investment does not perform within the time horizon we project, we face significant risk of either having to close the position at a time when the market price or liquidity might be unfavorable, or extending financing arrangements beyond the time frame initially anticipated, which can result in paying higher financing costs than projected. If a significant investment such as this fails to perform as anticipated our return on investment, business, liquidity, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations could be materially negatively affected, and the magnitude of the loss could be significant.\nSubstantially all of our investing and market-making positions are marked-to-market on a daily basis and declines in asset values directly and immediately impact our earnings. Although we may take measures to manage market risk, such as employing position limits, hedging and using quantitative risk measures, we may incur significant losses from our trading activities due to leverage, market fluctuations, currency fluctuations and volatility. To the extent that we own assets, i.e., have long positions, a downturn in the value of those assets or markets could result in losses. Conversely, to the extent we have sold assets we do not own, i.e., have short positions, an upturn in those markets could expose us to potentially large losses as we attempt to cover our short positions by acquiring assets in a rising market. We cannot give assurance that our investing and market-making strategies will be effective in all situations or that those activities will always be profitable. For example, an increase in interest rates, a general decline in debt or equity markets, an inability to properly and cost effectively hedge, economic slowdowns, delays in timing of anticipated events, an inability to identify and engage suitable counterparties, or other market conditions adverse to companies or investments of the type in which we invest or for which we make markets, or other world events, such as wars, natural disasters or the outbreak of a pandemic like COVID-19, could result in a decline in the value of our investments.\nAdditionally, changes in existing laws, rules or regulations, or judicial or administrative interpretations thereof, or new laws, rules or regulations could have an adverse impact on our investments.\nWe may need to raise additional capital, and we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available or available on attractive terms.\nTo satisfy or refinance existing obligations, service our debt obligations, support the development of our business or pursue additional growth through acquisition, we depend on our ability to generate cash flow from operations and to borrow funds and issue securities in the capital markets. To the extent we are unable to generate cash flows sufficient to meet our obligations, we may require additional financing for liquidity, capital requirements or growth initiatives. We may not be able to obtain financing on terms and at interest rates that are favorable to us, or at all. An inability to obtain financing in the future could materially and adversely affect our plans, business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are dependent upon our relationships with U.S. securities broker-dealer and clearing firms to receive and transmit funds internationally.\nFunds invested by our customers in securities of U.S. companies are transmitted to U.S. registered securities broker-dealer and clearing firms. Funds from the sale of securities are transmitted from such U.S. registered securities broker-dealer and clearing firms back to us through international banking electronic transfers, which can experience clerical and administrative mistakes, be subject to technical interruption, be delayed, or otherwise fail to work as planned. We do not have any control over these funds transfers. Failures or substantial delays in funds transfers could impair our customer relationships. Damage to or the loss of our relationships with these U.S. registered securities broker-dealer and clearing firms could also impair our ability to continue to offer such services to our customers which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nSignificant reliance on a related party brokerage firm poses risks associated with a concentrated source of revenue and evolving market regulations might increase risks for conflicts of interest, direct competition, and reduce commission revenue from that brokerage.\nSince November 2015 Timur Turlov has been our controlling shareholder and served as a member of the Company\u2019s board of directors and its CEO. In July of 2014 he created and has remained the sole owner of FFIN Brokerage Services, Inc., a corporation registered in and licensed as a broker dealer in Belize (\u201cFFIN Brokerage\u201d). Many of our clients are also clients of FFIN Brokerage. In Eurasia, as a foreign broker dealer, FFIN Brokerage has been able to provide easier access to the U.S. securities markets, which conduct business in U.S. dollars, to investors in Russia and Kazakhstan, due to local regulations that imposed restrictions on foreign currency accounts, required mandatory securities custody in-country, and limited access to foreign securities, unless listed on local exchanges. Over the past few years, the securities markets in Russia and Kazakhstan have developed substantially and many of the barriers to open access to foreign securities and foreign stock markets have been reduced or eliminated. However, since 2015 our subsidiaries have conducted substantial business with FFIN Brokerage and as disclosed in Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements, we continue to realize a substantial majority of our annual commission revenue from transactions conducted with FFIN Brokerage. We anticipate that the maturing of foreign securities markets might reduce the competitive advantage of FFIN Brokerage to clients in Russia and Kazakhstan, resulting in slower or negative growth to FFIN Brokerage. We do not know how this might change that firm\u2019s strategy or impact us. Additionally, FFIN Brokerage is a securities dealer and has direct client relationships with some of our subsidiaries. This aspect of our relationship has provided our subsidiaries substantial liquidity pools and has enhanced our ability to act as a prominent market maker on local securities exchanges. Significant changes to FFIN Brokerage or our relationship with that firm and its clients might result in increased direct competition or create conflicts of interests that might not be resolved in our favor, as well as adversely affect our business strategy and the revenue we currently derive from executing it.\nWe may suffer significant loss from changes in the KASE\u2019s requirements related to the discount coefficients on the securities in securities repurchase transactions.\nAs part of our investment activities, we raise funds through repurchase transactions on the KASE. Depending on the reliability of the instrument used to secure the repurchase transaction, the KASE has established the size of the discount for securities. The discount is a decreasing coefficient that sets the maximum borrowing amount for repurchase transactions in relation to each individual instrument. In the event of unexpected changes in the terms of the discount, we may incur financial losses associated with the need to sell securities to cover liquidity at a cost disadvantageous to us, or due to the need to borrow necessary funds at higher rates.\nGeographic, Currency and Political Risks\nWe face risks relating to doing business in some Eurasian markets and consumer financial services sectors within those markets.\nOperating in the consumer financial services sectors in emerging Eurasian markets exposes us to certain risks that are different from those in the U.S. and more developed markets, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing legal rights\n\u2022\ncorruption in certain countries\n\u2022\neconomic volatility and sustained\neconomic downturns\n\u2022\nrestrictive changes in securities brokerage, financial services and banking laws\n\u2022\ndiffering and sometimes conflicting\n\u2022\nunpredictable, uncertain and potentially adverse\nlegal and regulatory regimes\nchanges to tax regimes\n\u2022\ndifficulties in developing, staffing, and\n\u2022\nrisks related to government regulation and\nsimultaneously managing a number of\nuncertain protection and enforcement of our\nforeign operations\nintellectual property rights\n\u2022\nuncertain and changing judicial and regulatory environments and requirements\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations and currency exchange controls\n\u2022\nprocuring adequate insurance\n\u2022\npolitical or social unrest, including international conflicts\nThe Russian political regime poses special challenges which could impact adversely our major business commitments and activities in country.\nNotable risks related to operating in Russia, include:\n\u2022\nconflict between Russia and Ukraine that\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities could determine that we\ncould lead to further sanctions affecting\nhold a dominant position in our markets, and\nour business\ncould impose limitations on our operational\n\u2022\napplicable to our operations\nflexibility\nthe implementation of government\n\u2022\nlaws restricting foreign investment\npolicies targeted at specific individuals or\n\u2022\nknow-your-client requirements established by\ncompanies with which we do business\nRussian anti-money laundering legislation may\n\u2022\nmandatory U.S. and EU sanctions\nadversely impact our transaction volumes\nscreening may be inhibited by Russian\ndata privacy laws and constraints\nWe are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation risks.\nBecause our business is conducted outside the U.S., we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. This exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and can have a material impact on our financial statements. Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currencies of our subsidiaries include the Russian ruble, European euro, Ukrainian hryvnia, Uzbekistani som, Kazakhstani tenge, Kyrgyzstani som and the Azerbaijani manat. For financial reporting purposes, those currencies are translated into U.S. dollars as the reporting currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet dates. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the reporting period. As the value of the functional currencies of our subsidiaries weakens against the U.S. dollar, we may realize losses arising as a result of translating such foreign currencies to U.S. dollars. Conversely, as the value of the U.S. dollar weakens against the functional currencies of our subsidiaries, we may realize gains arising as a result of currency translation.\nWe conduct operations in several different currencies. This subjects us to currency exchange rate risk. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. We cannot assure that such currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. While we may employ strategies to hedge against currency fluctuations, the use of such strategies can also result in the loss of potential benefits that might result from favorable exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe face interest rate change risks.\nFluctuations in interest rates can impact our earnings. Declines in interest rates can have a detrimental effect on the interest we earn. While we believe we are positioned to benefit from rising interest rates, a rise in interest rates could negatively impact us if market conditions or the competitive environment induces us to raise our interest rates or replace deposits with higher cost funding sources without offsetting increases in yields on interest-earning assets.\nDeterioration of Russia\u2019s relations with other countries could negatively affect the economies of Russia and the neighboring countries in which our subsidiaries operate.\nOver the past several years, Russia has been involved in economic and military conflicts that have on several occasions resulted in the deterioration of Russia\u2019s relations with other members of the international community, including the United States, Ukraine and various countries in Europe. These jurisdictions are home to important financial markets, financial institutions and companies that are significant investors in Russia whose investment strategies and decisions may be affected by such conflicts and by worsening relations with Russia.\nFurther, events in Ukraine, Crimea and Syria have prompted condemnation by members of the international community and have been strongly opposed by the European Union and the United States, with a resulting material negative impact on the relationship between the United States and Russia. The Ukraine crisis, which began in 2013, remains unresolved, and has brought additional tensions between Russia and the United States. Other recent points of tension between Russia and Western governments have included: the Russian role in the Syrian crisis and its military support for the government of Syria; the alleged involvement of the Russian government in the cyber-attacks aimed at disrupting the election process in the U.S.; the alleged involvement of the Russian intelligence service in an attempted poisoning of a Russian citizen in the UK; the incident involving Ukrainian vessels near the Kerch Strait in November 2018; and, most recently, the incarceration of a prominent Russian public figure Alexey Navalny. These events have contributed to the escalation of geopolitical tensions, and have initiated responses from Ukraine, the European Union, and the United States in the form of economic sanctions on certain Russian government officials, private individuals and Russian companies.\nThe emergence of new or escalated tensions between Russia and the United States, Ukraine or European countries could negatively affect the economies of Russia, Ukraine and other countries in which we operate. This, in turn, may result in a general lack of confidence among international investors in the region\u2019s economic and political stability and in Russian regional investments generally. Such lack of confidence may result in reduced liquidity, trading volatility and significant declines in the price of listed securities of companies with operations in the region, and in our inability to attract, retain or grow our customer base and their investments related to our broker-dealer and banking operations in these countries, which would, in turn, could negatively affect our business growth, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nTaxation Risks Related to our International Operations\nGlobal anti-offshore measures could adversely impact our business.\nIn 2013 the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) and G20 countries accepted that existing international tax rules create opportunities for base erosion and profit shifting, because these rules have been designed more than a century ago. Pursuing solutions for this problem, OECD and G20 countries adopted a 15-point Action Plan to Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d). The BEPS package of measures represents the substantial renovation of the international tax rules. In light of the new measures, it is expected that profits will be reported where the economic activities that generate them are carried out and where value is created.\nThe Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters developed by the Council of Europe and the OECD in 1988 and amended by Protocol in 2010 is now signed by 141 jurisdictions (the Russian Federation, Cyprus, Kazakhstan are among the signatories). This Convention, requires competent authorities of jurisdictions-signatories to participate in the automatic exchange of information that is foreseeably relevant for the administration or enforcement of their domestic laws concerning the taxes. In addition the Convention requires competent authorities of jurisdictions-signatories to participate in the exchange of information on request and, by virtue of Article 7, stipulates that such competent authorities should participate in spontaneous exchange of information. In 2016 the Russian Federation (in 2018 Kazakhstan) joined the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information (Common Reporting Standard, the \u201cCRS\u201d). CRS calls on jurisdictions to obtain information from their financial institutions and automatically exchange that information with other jurisdictions on an annual basis. The Russian Federation also adopted country-by-country reporting (\u201cCbCR\u201d) requirements which assume automatic exchange of county-by-country reports.\nThe above developments in terms of global information exchange could complicate tax planning as well as related business decisions and could possibly expose us to significant fines and penalties and to enforcement measures, despite our best efforts at compliance, and could result in a greater than expected tax burden.\nOn November 24, 2016, the OECD published the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS (\u201cMLI\u201d) which introduces new provisions to existing double tax treaties limiting the use of tax benefits provided thereby. As a minimum standard MLI implements principle purposes test, under which treaty benefits are disallowed if one of the principle purposes of the transaction or the structure was to obtain a tax benefit.\nOn May 1, 2019 the MLI was ratified by the Russian Federation. Cyprus ratified the MLI on January 22, 2020 while Kazakhstan ratified MLI on February 20, 2020. Application of MLI could potentially limit tax benefits granted by double tax treaties of Russian Federation, Cyprus and Kazakhstan.\nThe implementation of global instruments means the application of such instruments by competent authorities on mutually agreed grounds, however, there might be a risk that competent authorities of jurisdictions where our subsidiaries operate would apply newly introduced global transparency instruments inconsistently, which would lead to the imposition of additional taxes on us.\nFrequent changes in the Russian tax system could adversely affect our business and the value of investments in Russia.\nWe are subject to a broad range of taxes and other compulsory payments imposed at federal, regional and local levels, including, but not limited to, profits tax, VAT and social contributions. Tax laws, namely the Russian Tax Code, have been in force for a short period relative to tax laws in more developed market economies, and the implementation of these tax laws is still unclear or inconsistent. The Russian tax laws and regulations are subject to frequent changes, varying and contradicting interpretations and inconsistent and selective enforcement. Although the quality of Russian tax legislation has generally improved since the introduction of the first and second parts of the Russian Tax Code, there is a possibility that in the future Russia may impose arbitrary or burdensome taxes and penalties, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn November 27, 2017, the Federal Law No. 340-FZ introducing CbCR requirements was published. The mandatory filing requirements or CbCR apply to financial years starting in 2017 (except for the provisions regarding the national documentation). Thus, if we reach the reporting threshold established for the consolidated revenue of the group (over RUB 50 billion if parent company for CbCR purposes is regarded as Russian tax resident or over relevant threshold established in any other jurisdiction as applicable (e.g. EUR 750 million for Cyprus))) we may be liable to submit relevant CbCR. It is unclear at the moment how the above measures will be applied in practice by the tax authorities and courts.\nCertain other changes were introduced to the Russian Tax Code over the recent years, namely changes to types of controlled transactions subject to transfer pricing rules, increase of the VAT rate to 20%, etc.\nOn September 8, 2020, the protocol on amendment of double tax treaty between Russia and Cyprus was signed. The amendments increased the withholding tax rate of the double tax treaty with respect to dividends and interest to 15% (with certain exceptions). The amendments were ratified in the end of 2020 and came into effect starting from January 1, 2021.\nFurther changes to the Russian tax regime, particularly those that would require us to make substantially larger tax payments or impede effective tax planning, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRussian and Cypriot transfer pricing legislation may require pricing adjustments and impose additional tax liabilities.\nRussian Transfer Pricing Legislation\nThe existing Russian transfer pricing rules became effective from January 1, 2012. Under these rules the Russian tax authorities are allowed to make transfer-pricing adjustments and impose additional tax liabilities in respect of certain types of transactions (\u201ccontrolled\u201d transactions). The list of the \u201ccontrolled\u201d transactions includes transactions with related parties (with several exceptions such as guarantees between Russian non-banking organizations and interest-free loans between Russian related parties) and certain types of cross border transactions.\nThe burden of proving market prices, as well as keeping specific documentation, lies with the taxpayers. In certain circumstances, the Russian tax authorities may apply the transfer pricing rules and methods in cases where the rules are formally not applicable, claiming additional tax charges calculated using the transfer rules but based on other tax concepts (e.g. anti-avoidance rules, lack of economic justification of expenses, etc.). It is therefore possible that Company subsidiaries established in Russia may become subject to transfer pricing tax audits by tax authorities in the foreseeable future. As a result, the Russian tax authorities may challenge the level of prices applied by the Company under the \u201ccontrolled\u201d transactions (including certain intercompany transactions) or challenge the methods used to prove prices applied by the Company, and as a result accrue additional tax liabilities. If additional taxes are assessed with respect to these matters, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCypriot Transfer Pricing Legislation\nThe arm\u2019s length principle in the Cyprus income tax law requires that all transactions between related parties should be carried out on an arm\u2019s length basis, being at fair values and on normal commercial terms.\nThe amendment to the income tax law, effective as of January 1, 2015, extends the arm\u2019s length principle by introducing the possibility of, in cases where two related Cyprus tax residents transact and the Cyprus tax authorities make an upward arm\u2019s length adjustment to one of them, effecting a corresponding downwards adjustment to the other one.\nOn June 30, 2017, the Cyprus tax authorities issued a tax technical circular (Circular) providing guidance for the tax treatment of intra-group financing transactions (IGFTs). The Circular effective as from July 1, 2017 closely follows the application of the arm\u2019s length principle of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and it applies for all relevant existing and future IGFTs. In this respect, the remuneration on all IGFTs should be supported by a transfer pricing study in order to be accepted by the Cyprus tax authorities.\nIGFTs for the purposes of the Circular are defined as (i) any activity relating to granting of loans or cash advances to related companies that is or should be remunerated by interest; and (ii) such activity is financed by financial means and instruments, such as debentures, private loans, cash advances and bank loans.\nThe Circular requires that the transfer pricing study should be prepared by independent experts and will have to be based on the relevant OECD standards for the purposes of (i) describing (delineating) the IGFT by performing a comparability analysis based on the functional and risk profile of the company; and (ii) determining the applicable arm\u2019s length remuneration by performing an economic analysis.\nThere are no specific transfer pricing rules or any transfer pricing documentation requirements in the Cyprus tax laws with respect to any other related party transactions. However, Cyprus is in the late stages of adopting transfer pricing rules, covering all types of transactions, that are applicable to Cyprus tax resident companies or Cyprus permanent establishments that meet the standards set in the OECD BEPS Action 13: Transfer Pricing Documentation and Country-by-Country Reporting. The Cyprus draft transfer pricing legislation is expected to be enacted within the coming months.\nRussian anti-offshore measures expose us to tax liability risks.\nThe Russian Federation, like a number of other countries in the world, is actively involved in implementation of measures against tax evasion through the use of low tax jurisdictions as well as aggressive tax planning structures. Starting from January 1, 2015, the Federal Law No. 376-FZ, introducing the concept of \u201ccontrolled foreign companies\u201d (the \u201cCFC Rules\u201d), the concept of \u201ccorporate tax residency\u201d and the concept of \u201cbeneficial ownership\u201d into Russian tax legislation, came into force. Moreover, Russia has entered into several multilateral agreements for the exchange of information between the tax authorities of different countries.\nUnder the Russian CFC Rules, in certain circumstances, undistributed profits of foreign companies and non-corporate structures (e.g., trusts, funds or partnerships) domiciled in foreign jurisdictions, which are ultimately owned and/ or controlled by Russian tax residents (legal entities and individuals) will be subject to taxation in Russia. The Russian CFC Rules are being constantly developed. A number of amendments to the Russian CFC Rules were made within 2015-2020 years. In the meantime, certain provisions of the Russian CFC Rules are still ambiguous and may be subject to arbitrary interpretation by the Russian tax authorities.\nUnder the concept of \u201ccorporate tax residency\u201d a foreign legal entity may be recognized as a Russian tax resident if: (i) its executive body(ies) operates in respect of such company in Russia on regular basis (however, the activity of executive body will not be viewed as regular if it is insignificant compared to the one in the other jurisdiction), or (ii) senior executive personnel of the company who are authorized to plan and control activities of the company and take responsibility over it basically carry out management of the company from Russia (i.e. make decisions or take any other measures in respect of operational activities of the company that are within the competence of the company\u2019s executive body). When an entity is recognized as Russian tax resident it is obligated to register with the Russian tax authorities, calculate and pay Russian tax on its worldwide income and comply with other tax-related rules established for Russian entities. There is still an uncertainty as to how these criteria will be applied by the Russian tax authorities in practice.\nUnder the Russian Tax Code, a beneficial owner is defined as a person who by means of direct and/or indirect participation or control over other organizations or otherwise, has the right to own, use or dispose of income, or the person on whose behalf another person is authorized to use and/or dispose of such income. When determining the beneficial owner, the functions of a foreign person that is claiming the application of reduced tax rates under an applicable double tax treaty and the risks that such person takes should be analyzed. Starting from January 1, 2017, the Russian Tax Code requires a tax agent, i.e. the payer of income, in addition to a certificate of tax residency to obtain a confirmation from the recipient of the income that it is the beneficial owner of the income. To date, there is still no approved or recommended format of such confirmation letter and (or) the precise list of documents to be obtained from the recipient of income claiming the beneficial owner status.\nWe might be subject to additional tax liabilities because of these changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUncertainties and ongoing changes in Kazakhstan\u2019s tax regime may have an adverse impact on our business.\nKazakhstan\u2019s tax regime is subject to ongoing changes, resulting in unknowns in the interpretation and application of its tax laws.\nFor example, the Kazakhstan government has taken steps to promote investment in its financial markets, including providing a preferential tax regime on the territory of the Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC) established by the AIFC Constitutional Law. Among other tax benefits, there is an exemption from corporate income tax of commission income earned by the AIFC-registered member from rendering defined financial services in the territory of the AIFC. It is currently unclear whether an AIFC-registered member is eligible for the tax benefits if, for example, it renders services online through employees working outside the territory of AIFC. As a result of these uncertainties, the availability of the new tax exemptions to the Company is currently unclear. which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nMore generally, Kazakhstan tax legislation is subject to frequent changes, varying and potentially contradicting interpretations and inconsistencies. There can be no assurance that the Kazakhstan tax legislation will not be changed in the future in a manner that makes our tax planning unpredictable. Further, the introduction of new taxes, amendments to current taxation rules, or new interpretations of existing tax law may have a substantial impact on the overall amount of our tax liabilities. There is no assurance that we would not be required to make substantially larger tax payments in the future, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure and Internal Operations\nWe are a diversified holding company with few operations of our own and are reliant on the operations of our subsidiaries to fund holding company operations.\nOur operations are conducted primarily through our subsidiaries and our ability to generate cash to fund our operations and expenses, to pay dividends or to meet debt service obligations is highly dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries through dividends or intercompany loans. Deterioration in the financial condition, earnings or cash flow of our subsidiaries for any reason, including the risks discussed herein as applicable or the occurrence of such events to any such subsidiary, could limit or impair their ability to pay such distributions. Additionally, to the extent our subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions under applicable laws or regulations or under the terms of financing arrangements or are otherwise unable to provide funds to the extent of our needs, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nAs a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under Nasdaq rules, we qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that may adversely affect our stock price.\nTimur Turlov controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of Nasdaq corporate governance standards. Under Nasdaq rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by one individual is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance standards, including the requirements that:\n\u2022\na majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors\n\u2022\neach committee have a written charter addressing such committee\u2019s purpose and\n\u2022\nour audit committee, nominating and\nresponsibilities\ncorporate governance committee and compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors\n\u2022\nan annual evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance committee and compensation committee be performed\nWe currently utilize an exemption to allow Mr. Turlov to sit on each of our nominating and corporate governance committee. The charters for each committee provide for annual performance evaluations. Currently we do have a majority of independent directors on the board of directors. Our status as a controlled company and resulting available exemptions from corporate governance standards could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nTimur Turlov has control over key decision making.\nTimur Turlov, our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors, beneficially owns 71.3% of our outstanding common stock. Mr. Turlov currently has sole voting control of FRHC and can control the outcome of matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, stock splits, recapitalizations, and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, Mr. Turlov has the ability to control our management and affairs as a result of his position as our chief executive officer, chairman of our board of directors and his ability to control the election of our directors. As a board member and officer, Mr. Turlov owes fiduciary duties to our stockholders and must act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interest of our stockholders. As a stockholder, however, Mr. Turlov is entitled to vote his shares of common stock according to his personal interests, which may not always be in the interest of our stockholders generally. Mr. Turlov is prohibited from membership on our audit committee under the terms of the audit committee charter adopted by our board of directors.\nWe are dependent on our executive management team, particularly Timur Turlov, and our ability to hire and retain skilled personnel.\nWe depend on the efforts, skills, reputations and business contacts of our executive management team, in particular Timur Turlov, and the management teams of our subsidiaries. These individuals have made significant contributions to our success and we believe our success moving forward depends, to a significant extent, upon the experience of these individuals, whose continued service is not guaranteed. If certain individuals leave or are otherwise no longer available to us for any number of reasons, including because of the outbreak of a pandemic such as COVID-19, we may not be able to replace them with comparable capable personnel.\nThe pool of experienced and qualified employee candidates is limited in some of the geographical areas where we conduct business, and competition for skilled employees can be significant. We are dependent, in part, on our continued ability to hire, engage and retain skilled employees. Additionally, we rely upon experienced managerial, marketing and support personnel to effectively manage our business and to successfully promote our services. If we do not succeed in engaging and retaining skilled employees and other personnel, or if we experience a loss of such personnel, or if productivity significantly declines, we may be unable to meet our objectives and, as a result, our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe anticipate that acquisitions will continue to play a key role in our growth strategy, but we may be unable to identify, acquire, close or integrate acquisition targets successfully.\nAcquisitions have been, and will likely continue to be, a significant component of our growth strategy; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to grow our business through acquisitions as we have done historically, that businesses acquired will perform in accordance with our expectations or that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove to be correct. We will continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position, expand our customer base or enhance our existing service offerings. There is no assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future, nor is there assurance that completed acquisitions will be successful. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, there is substantial cost and time expended to complete post-closing integration of acquisitions, including human resource training, data and technology systems and operational processes. We may also incur unanticipated liabilities. Any such difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, we cannot provide any assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits and/or synergies of any such acquisition or investment.\nRisks Related to Information Technology and Cyber Security\nOur broker-dealer, financial services, and banking operations are highly dependent on the continued and proper functioning of our information technology systems and particularly \u201cTradernet\u201d, our proprietary electronic trading platform.\nOur broker-dealer, financial services and banking businesses are highly dependent on processing, on a daily basis, a large number of communications and increasingly complex transactions across diverse markets, in various languages. These communications and transactions are accomplished primarily through electronic information technology systems (\u201cIT\u201d) that are comprised of a wide array of computer systems, software and underlying infrastructure that enable them to function. The financial, accounting, or other data processing systems we or the firms that clear transactions on behalf of our customers use may fail to operate properly, become disabled, or otherwise become unavailable, as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. These events may include a disruption of electrical, communications, internet or other infrastructure, or related services, or our inability to access or use one or more of our facilities, as a result of any number of occurrences, including the outbreak of a pandemic such as COVID-19.\nThe inability of these systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our business operations. If any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled or otherwise unavailable, or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, personnel, or systems related to the electronic communications and functionality our operations depend on, we could suffer impairment to our liquidity, financial loss, a disruption of business, liability to clients, regulatory intervention, or reputational damage.\nFurther, our \u201cTradernet\u201d electronic trading platform is proprietary technology that plays a key role in both our customers\u2019 use of our services and for other important aspects of our business. Errors, failures, delays, interruptions, disruptions, vulnerabilities, bugs, incompatibility, obsolescence, or similar issues with Tradernet, or the software or systems upon which Tradernet relies for its functionality, however caused, could result in business disruptions, financial loss, reputational damage, and other adverse impacts on our business.\nOur electronic trading platform \u201cTradernet\u201d is subject to competition risks.\nOur \u201cTradernet\u201d electronic trading platform is proprietary technology that has taken substantial resources and time to develop and requires continued development to compete with other trading platforms. Adoption or development of similar or superior platforms or technologies by our competitors may require that we devote substantial resources to the further development of Tradernet, or other software platforms, to remain competitive. The markets in which we provide services are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changing trading systems, practices and techniques. Although Tradernet has remained competitive in our markets in the past, we may not be able to keep up with these rapid changes in the future, develop new technology, realize a return on amounts invested in developing new technologies or remain competitive in the future.\nWe interact with large volumes of sensitive data that exposes us to IT breach and other data security risks and liabilities.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential, personal, financial and other information in our computer systems and networks. Our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, spyware or other malicious code, and other evolving cyber security threats. The occurrence of one or more of these events could: (a) jeopardize confidential and other information processed by, stored in, and transmitted through our computer systems and networks or the computer systems and networks of our customers or other third parties with whom we conduct business; or (b) otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers or third parties with whom we conduct business. In addition, new and expanding data privacy laws and regulations are, or soon will be, in effect in many of the jurisdictions where we conduct business. These pose increasingly complex compliance challenges, which may increase compliance costs, and compliance failures could result in significant fines, penalties and liability.\nWe have previously encountered cyber security incidents which targeted our information systems, but which were contained by our response teams and generated negligible impacts. There is also a possibility that we are not currently aware of certain undisclosed vulnerabilities in our IT systems and other assets. Although our subsidiaries have implemented cyber security strategies for mitigating these risks, we cannot be sure that our network and information technology systems will not be subject to such issues, or, if they are, that we will be able to maintain the integrity of our customers\u2019 and employees\u2019 data or that malware or other technical or operational issues will not disrupt our network or systems and cause significant harm to our operations. If our services are affected by such attacks and malware and this degrades our services, our products and services may be perceived as being vulnerable to cyber risk and the integrity of our data protection systems may be questioned. As a result, users and customers may curtail or stop using our products and services, and we may incur reputational damage, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties, reimbursement or other compensatory costs.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic the vast majority of our employees, including those who process our transactions are working remotely, which may further increase the risk of cyber security breaches. While we have implemented risk management and contingency plans and taken other precautions designed to address cyber security, there is no guarantee such measures will adequately protect our business, as remote working environments may be less secure and more susceptible to cyber security threats.\nWe do not maintain insurance policies to mitigate these risks because such insurance may not be available or may be more expensive than the perceived benefit. Further, any insurance that we may purchase to mitigate certain risks may not cover all losses.\nThe infrastructure on which our IT systems depend, and particularly those in the emerging markets of our subsidiaries, are subject to events that could interrupt our ability operate.\nThe infrastructure upon which our operations and IT systems depend, including electrical communications and internet, and transportation and other services, are vulnerable to damage or disruptions from events outside our control, including natural disasters, military conflicts, power, telecommunications and internet unavailability or outages, terrorist acts, riots, government shutdown orders, changes in government regulation, equipment or system failures or an inability to access or operate such equipment or systems, human error or intentional wrongdoings, cyber-attacks or any other types of information technology security threats. In addition, as we operate in emerging markets which may have an increased threat of terrorism, military conflict, social unrest or governmental interference with infrastructure, which could result in property damage, business interruption and damage to our brand or reputation. The local authorities may order our subsidiaries to temporarily shut down their entire network or part or all of our networks may be shut down due to actions relating to military conflicts or nationwide strike.\nBecause we have employees in a number of cities in Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, Germany, the United States and Cyprus, all of whom need to work and communicate as an integrated team, the functionality of the infrastructure affects our ability to conduct business. If a disruption occurs in one location and our employees in that location are unable to communicate with or travel to other locations, our ability to service and interact with our customers may suffer. While we have contingency plans in place to address such issues, these plans may not always be deployed successfully or be sufficiently adequate to fully offset the impacts of such disruptions. We do not maintain insurance policies to mitigate these risks because such insurance may not be available or may be more expensive than the perceived benefit. Further, any insurance that we may purchase to mitigate certain risks may not cover all losses.\nIn addition, the computers and data centers that process trades and payments are located in the same locale. If a catastrophic event were to occur at that locale it may result in the permanent data loss. More generally, substantial property and equipment loss, and disruption in operations as well as any defects in our systems or those of third parties or other difficulties could expose us to liability and materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations in all of our operating segments. In addition, any outage or disruptive efforts could adversely impact our reputation and future prospects.\nFailure of third-party systems and operations on which we rely could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on certain third-party computer systems or third-party service providers, including clearing systems, exchange systems, banking systems, Internet service, co-location facilities, communications facilities and other facilities. Any interruption in these third-party services, or deterioration in their performance, could be disruptive to our business. If our arrangement with any third-party is terminated, we may not be able to find an alternative source of systems support on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success also depends on the continued availability, development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure globally and particularly in the countries in which we operate. This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity and security for providing reliable internet services. Any disruption in the network access provided by third parties or any failure by them to handle current or higher future volumes of use may significantly harm our business. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience interruptions and delays in service from time to time. Furthermore, we depend on hardware and software suppliers for prompt delivery, installation and service of servers and other equipment to deliver our services.\nA recent law, which partly came in force in November 2019, introduced tighter regulation of traffic routing in the Russian internet. While it is not entirely clear yet how this regulation will be applied in practice, its implementation, among other things, may lead to a requirement that Russian internet traffic should be routed through Russian communication centers. This could reduce data transfer speed significantly and even result in interruptions and delays of the online services in the Russian internet.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated historically and may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u2022\nindustry or general market conditions\n\u2022\nchanges in customer preferences\n\u2022\ncountry risk associated with the countries in which we conduct operations\n\u2022\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or lack of research coverage and reports by industry analysts\n\u2022\nnew regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines\n\u2022\nlawsuits, enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results\n\u2022\ndomestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations or earnings of similar companies\n\u2022\nannouncements by us of significant impairment charges\n\u2022\nadditions/departures of key personnel\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of us and our industry\n\u2022\nactions by large position stockholders, including future sales of our common stock\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions or strategic partnerships\n\u2022\ncompletions of significant asset acquisitions or dispositions\n\u2022\nwar, terrorist acts, civil unrest and epidemic disease\n\u2022\nany future sales of our common stock or other securities\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community\n\u2022\nmisconduct or other improper actions of our employees\nStock markets can experience extreme volatility unrelated to the operating performance of any particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, class action litigation has often been instituted against the affected company. Any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nFuture offerings of securities which would rank senior to our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize our board of directors to fix the relative rights and preferences of our 20,000,000 shares of authorized preferred stock, without approval from our stockholders. This could affect the rights of our common stockholders regarding, among other things, voting, distributions, dividends and liquidation. We could also use the preferred stock to deter or delay a change in control of FRHC that may be opposed by our management, even if the transaction might be favorable to our common stockholders.\nIf, in the future, we issue debt or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock, it is possible that such securities will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock. We and, indirectly, our stockholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings in the Company.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future and, consequently, our stockholders\u2019 ability to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe currently intend to use our future earnings to repay debt, to fund our growth, to develop our business, for working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. We are not likely to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, and the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in the value of our common stock. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain its current value. Payments of dividends, if any, are at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including general and economic conditions, our financial condition and operating results, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions and implications of the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us, and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our operations are conducted almost entirely through our subsidiaries. As such, to the extent that we determine in the future to pay dividends on our common stock, none of our subsidiaries will be obligated to make funds available to us for the payment of such dividends. Further, Nevada law imposes additional requirements that may restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock.\nGeneral Business Risks\nOur business is affected by general business and economic conditions and securities market performance, and those in the particular countries in which we operate.\nDemand for our products and services is affected by a number of general business and economic conditions. A decline in the Russian, Kazakhstani, Ukrainian, Cypriot, European or U.S. financial markets or general economies could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our profit margins, as well as overall demand for our services, can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including economic recessions, changes in customer preferences, investor and consumer confidence, inflation, availability of credit, fluctuation in interest and currency exchange rates, changes in the fiscal or monetary policies of governments, a widespread pandemic, such as COVID-19, and political circumstances (including wars and terrorist acts) in the regions in which we operate.\nWe do not produce predictable earnings. We cannot foresee the duration of current conditions or the timing or strength of any future activities on economies generally, or the global markets. Weakness in the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. More generally, because our business is correlated to the general economic outlook, a significant deterioration in that outlook or realization of certain events could have a significant negative impact on our businesses and overall results of operations.\nUnforeseen or catastrophic events, including pandemics, terrorist attacks, extreme weather events or other natural disasters or political discord could negatively impact our business.\nThe occurrence of unforeseen or catastrophic events, including the emergence of a pandemic or other widespread health emergency (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency), political discord, terrorist attacks, armed conflict, extreme weather events or other natural disasters, could create, and in the case of COVID-19 has created, and may continue to create, economic and financial disruptions, and could lead to operational difficulties (including quarantine, shelter in place and travel limitations) that could impair our ability to operate our business as it has normally operated.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and will likely continue to impact the global economy, global financial markets and our business financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created financial disruption and impacted the economies of every country in which we operate. Health and safety measures implemented to address the spread of the pandemic have impacted our business, our operations and our employees. The extent to which the pandemic will impact our business, operational and financial performance, results of operations and liquidity in future periods will depend on the duration and severity of the pandemic in future periods, which is uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nWe believe that as a result of interventions by governments and central banks in response to the initial market declines related to the COVID-19 pandemic interest in financial markets significantly increased in the Eurasian markets where we operate. Since then, we have experienced unprecedented growth in client accounts, trading volume, commission and fee income and net income. We cannot foresee at this time, how long this trend may continue. Nor can we predict whether a return to more normal pre-COVID-19 conditions will result in continued growth at current rates or a return to more traditional levels of client account growth, trading volume, commission and fee income and net income we realized prior to the outbreak of COVID-19.\nAlthough financial markets have rebounded from the significant declines experienced during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak signs of underlying economic weakness persist, including elevated levels of market volatility, high unemployment, lack of consumer confidence, low interest rates, depressed levels of business activity in certain sectors, and increased cyber security, information security and operational risks resulting from expansion of remote work. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business, operational and financial performance going forward will continue to depend on certain developments, including the duration and severity of COVID-19 going forward, measures implemented by governments to address further outbreaks of the pandemic, and the impact on our customers, employees, the financial markets, the global economy and the economies of the countries in which we operate, all of which remain uncertain at this time.\nCredit Related Risks\nOur businesses have been and may in the future be adversely affected by disruptions or lack of liquidity in the credit markets, including reduced access to credit and higher costs of obtaining credit.\nWidening credit spreads, as well as significant declines in the availability of credit, have in the past adversely affected our ability to borrow on a secured and unsecured basis and may do so in the future. We fund ourselves on an unsecured basis by issuing long-term debt and commercial paper, by raising deposits at our bank subsidiaries, by issuing hybrid financial instruments and by obtaining loans or lines of credit from commercial or other banking entities. We seek to finance many of our assets on a secured basis. Any disruptions in the credit markets may make it harder and more expensive to obtain funding for our businesses. If our available funding is limited or we are forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, these conditions may require us to curtail our business activities and increase our cost of funding, both of which could reduce our profitability, particularly in our businesses that involve investing, lending and market making.\nOur clients engaging in mergers, acquisitions and other types of strategic transactions often rely on access to the secured and unsecured credit markets to finance their transactions. A lack of available credit or an increased cost of credit can adversely affect the size, volume and timing of our clients\u2019 merger and acquisition transactions, particularly large transactions, and adversely affect our financial advisory and underwriting businesses.\nOur credit businesses have been and may in the future be negatively affected by a lack of liquidity in credit markets. A lack of liquidity reduces price transparency, increases price volatility and decreases transaction volumes and size, all of which can increase transaction risk or decrease the profitability of these businesses.\nReductions in our credit ratings or an increase in our credit spreads may adversely affect our liquidity and cost of funding.\nOur cost of obtaining long-term unsecured funding is directly related to our credit spreads (the amount in excess of the interest rate of benchmark securities that we need to pay). Increases in our credit spreads can significantly increase our cost of this funding. Changes in credit spreads are continuous, market-driven, and subject at times to unpredictable and highly volatile movements. Our credit spreads are also influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness and movements in the costs to purchasers of credit default swaps referenced to our long-term debt. The market for credit default swaps has proven to be extremely volatile and at times has lacked a high degree of transparency or liquidity.", "PERMNO": 91437, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "FRHC"}
