{"cik": "1411579", "company": "AMC ENTERTAINMENT HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nWe have no control over distributors of the films and our business may be adversely affected if our access to motion pictures is limited or delayed.\nWe rely on distributors of motion pictures, over whom we have no control, for the films that we exhibit. Major motion picture distributors are required by law to offer and license film to exhibitors, including us, on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis. Consequently, we cannot assure ourselves of a supply of motion pictures by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must compete for our licenses on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis. Our business depends on maintaining good relations with these distributors, as this affects our ability to negotiate commercially favorable licensing terms for first-run films or to obtain licenses at all. With only 7 distributors representing approximately 89% of the U.S. box office in 2014, there is a high level of concentration in the industry. Our business may be adversely affected if our access to motion pictures is limited or delayed because of deterioration in our relationships with one or more distributors or for some other reason. To the extent that we are unable to license a popular film for exhibition in our theatres, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe depend on motion picture production and performance.\nOur ability to operate successfully depends upon the availability, diversity and appeal of motion pictures, our ability to license motion pictures and the performance of such motion pictures in our markets. The most attended films are usually released during the summer and the calendar year-end holidays, making our business highly seasonal. We license first-run motion pictures, the success of which has increasingly depended on the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios. Poor performance of, or any disruption in the production of these motion pictures (including by reason of a strike or lack of adequate financing), or a reduction in the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios, could hurt our business and results of operations. Conversely, the successful performance of these motion pictures, particularly the sustained success of any one motion picture, or an increase in effective marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios, may generate positive results for our business and operations in a specific fiscal quarter or year that may not necessarily be indicative of, or comparable to, future results of operations. As movie studios rely on a smaller number of higher grossing \"tent pole\" films there may be increased pressure for higher film licensing fees. In addition, a change in the type and breadth of movies offered by motion picture studios may adversely affect the demographic base of moviegoers.\nOur substantial debt could adversely affect our operations and prevent us from satisfying those debt obligations.\nWe have a significant amount of debt, all of which is debt of our subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding $1,900.3 million of indebtedness ($1,852.6 million face amount), which\nconsisted of $760.0 million under our Senior Secured Credit Facility ($761.4 million face amount), $1,024.0 million of our existing subordinated notes ($975.0 million face amount), $7.0 million promissory note and $109.3 million of existing capital and financing lease obligations, and $136.8 million would have been available for borrowing as additional senior debt under our Senior Secured Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2014, we also had approximately $3.5 billion of undiscounted rental payments under operating leases (with initial base terms generally between 15 to 20 years). The amount of our indebtedness and lease and other financial obligations could have important consequences to our stockholders. For example, it could:\n\u2022 increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022 limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes;\n\u2022 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of lease rentals and principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for operations and any future business opportunities;\n\u2022 limit our planning flexibility for, or ability to react to, changes in our business and the industry; and\n\u2022 place us at a competitive disadvantage with competitors who may have less indebtedness and other obligations or greater access to financing.\nIf we fail to make any required payment under our Senior Secured Credit Facility or the indentures governing our notes or to comply with any of the financial and operating covenants contained therein, we would be in default. Lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facility or holders of our notes, as applicable, could then decide to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facility or the indentures and in the case of the Senior Credit Facility, foreclose upon the stock and personal property of our subsidiaries that is pledged to secure the Senior Secured Credit Facility. Other creditors might then accelerate other indebtedness. If the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facility or holders of our notes accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness thereunder, we might not have sufficient assets to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the indentures, or our other indebtedness. Our indebtedness under our Senior Secured Credit Facility bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain prevailing interest rates (although, subject to certain conditions, such rates may be fixed for certain periods). If interest rates increase, we may be unable to meet our debt service obligations under our Senior Secured Credit Facility and other indebtedness.\nLimitations on the availability of capital may prevent deployment of strategic initiatives.\nOur key strategic initiatives, including recliner re-seats, enhanced food and beverage and premium sight & sound, require significant capital expenditures to implement. Our gross capital expenditures aggregated approximately $270.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $260.8 million, $72.8 million, and $40.1 million during year ended December 31, 2013, the period August 31, 2012 through December 31, 2012, and the period March 30, 2012 through August 30, 2012, respectively. We estimate that our gross cash outflows for capital expenditures will be approximately $320.0 million to $340.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2015. The lack of available capital resources due to business performance or other financial commitments could prevent or delay the deployment of innovations in our theatres. We may have to seek additional financing or issue additional securities to fully implement our growth strategy. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain new financing on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, covenants under our existing indebtedness limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, and the performance of any additional or improved theatres may not be sufficient to service the related indebtedness that we are permitted to incur.\nWe have had significant financial losses in previous years.\nPrior to fiscal 2007, we had reported net losses in each of the prior nine fiscal years totaling approximately $551.1 million. For fiscal 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, the period March 30, 2012 through August 30, 2012, the period August 31, 2012 through December 31, 2012, the year ended 2013, and the year ended 2014, we reported net earnings (losses) of $116.9 million, $(6.2) million, $(149.0) million, $79.9 million, $(174.3) million, $(94.1) million, $90.2 million, $(42.7) million, $364.4 million, and $64.1 million, respectively. If we experience poor financial results in the future, we may be unable to meet our payment obligations while attempting to expand our theatre circuit and withstand competitive pressures or adverse economic conditions.\nWe may be limited in our ability to utilize, or may not be able to utilize, net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our future tax liability.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had an estimated federal income tax loss carryforward of $649.8 million and estimated state income tax loss carryforward of $409.7 million which will be limited annually due to certain change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\") Section 382. Our federal tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2016 and will completely expire in 2034. Our state tax loss carryforwards may be used over various periods ranging from 1 to 20 years.\nWe have experienced numerous \"ownership changes\" within the meaning of Section 382(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including the Merger. These ownership changes have and will continue to subject our tax loss carryforwards to annual limitations which will restrict our ability to use them to offset our taxable income in periods following the ownership changes. In general, the annual use limitation equals the aggregate value of our equity at the time of the ownership change multiplied by a specified tax-exempt interest rate.\nWe are subject, at times, to intense competition.\nOur theatres are subject to varying degrees of competition in the geographic areas in which we operate. Competitors may be national circuits, regional circuits or smaller independent exhibitors. Competition among theatre exhibition companies is often intense with respect to the following factors:\n\u2022 Attracting patrons. The competition for patrons is dependent upon factors such as the availability of popular motion pictures, the location and number of theatres and screens in a market, the comfort and quality of the theatres and pricing. Many of our competitors have sought to increase the number of screens that they operate. Competitors have built or may be planning to build theatres in certain areas where we operate, which could result in excess capacity and increased competition for patrons.\n\u2022 Licensing motion pictures. We believe that the principal competitive factors with respect to film licensing include licensing terms, number of seats and screens available for a particular picture, revenue potential and the location and condition of an exhibitor's theatres.\n\u2022 New sites and acquisitions. We must compete with exhibitors and others in our efforts to locate and acquire attractive new and existing sites for our theatres. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire such new sites or existing theatres at reasonable prices or on favorable terms. Moreover, some of these competitors may be stronger financially than we are. As a result of the foregoing, we may not succeed in acquiring theatres or may have to pay more than we would prefer to make an acquisition.\nThe theatrical exhibition industry also faces competition from other forms of out-of-home entertainment, such as concerts, amusement parks and sporting events and from other distribution channels for filmed entertainment, such as cable television, pay-per-view and home video systems and from other forms of in-home entertainment.\nAn increase in the use of alternative film delivery methods or other forms of entertainment may drive down our attendance and limit our ticket prices.\nWe compete with other film delivery methods, including network, syndicated cable and satellite television and DVDs, as well as video-on-demand, pay-per-view services, video streaming and downloads via the Internet. We also compete for the public's leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including sporting events, amusement parks, live music concerts, live theatre and restaurants. An increase in the popularity of these alternative film delivery methods and other forms of entertainment could reduce attendance at our theatres, limit the prices we can charge for admission and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur results of operations may be impacted by shrinking theatrical exclusive release windows.\nOver the last decade, the average theatrical exclusive release window, which represents the time that elapses from the date of a film's theatrical release to the date a film is available on DVD or similar on-demand release to an important downstream market, has decreased from approximately six months to approximately three to four months. If patrons choose to wait for a DVD release, video streaming or other home entertainment options rather than attend a theatre for viewing the film, it may adversely impact our business and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In 2011, several major film studios have tested premium video-on-demand products released in homes approximately 60 days after a movie's theatrical debut, which threatened the length of the release window. In January 2015, Amazon Studios announced its intention to produce and acquire original movies for theatrical release with video streaming available just 4 to 8 weeks after their theatrical debut. We cannot assure you that this release window, which is determined by the film studios, will not shrink further or be eliminated altogether, which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that may limit our ability to take advantage of certain business opportunities advantageous to us.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022 incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022 pay dividends or make other distributions to our stockholders;\n\u2022 make restricted payments;\n\u2022 incur liens;\n\u2022 engage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022 enter into business combinations.\nThese restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand economic downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise.\nAlthough the indentures for our notes contain a fixed charge coverage test that limits our ability to incur indebtedness, this limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions and qualifications. Moreover, the indentures do not impose any limitation on our incurrence of lease obligations or liabilities that are not considered \"Indebtedness\" under the indentures (such as operating leases), nor do they impose any limitation on the amount of liabilities incurred by subsidiaries, if any, that might be designated as \"unrestricted subsidiaries,\" which are subsidiaries that we designate, that are not subject to the restrictive covenants contained in the indentures governing our notes.\nFurthermore, there are no restrictions in the indentures on our ability to invest in other entities (including unaffiliated entities) and no restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to enter into agreements restricting their ability to pay dividends or otherwise transfer funds to us. Also, although the indentures limit our ability to make dividends and other restricted payments, these restrictions are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications.\nGeneral political, social and economic conditions can reduce our attendance.\nOur success depends on general political, social and economic conditions and the willingness of consumers to spend money at movie theatres. If going to motion pictures becomes less popular or consumers spend less on food and beverage, which accounted for 29.6% of our revenues in calendar 2014, our operations could be adversely affected. In addition, our operations could be adversely affected if consumers' discretionary income falls as a result of an economic downturn. Geopolitical events, including the threat of domestic terrorism or cyber attacks, could cause people to avoid our theatres or other public places where large crowds are in attendance. In addition, due to our concentration in certain markets, natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes in those markets could adversely affect our overall results of operations.\nWe may be reviewed by antitrust authorities in connection with acquisition opportunities that would increase our number of theatres in markets where we have a leading market share.\nGiven our size and market share, pursuit of acquisition opportunities that would increase the number of our theatres in markets where we have a leading market share would likely result in significant review by the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice and States' Attorneys General, and we may be required to dispose of theatres in order to complete such acquisition opportunities. For example, in connection with the acquisition of Kerasotes, we were required to dispose of 11 theatres located in various markets across the United States, including Chicago, Denver and Indianapolis. As a result, we may not be able to succeed in acquiring other exhibition companies or we may have to dispose of a significant number of theatres in key markets in order to complete such acquisitions.\nWe depend on key personnel for our current and future performance.\nOur current and future performance depends to a significant degree upon the retention of our senior management team and other key personnel. The loss or unavailability to us of any member of our senior management team or a key employee could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we would be able to locate or employ qualified replacements for senior management or key employees on acceptable terms.\nOptimizing our theatre circuit through new construction and the transformation of our existing theatres may be subject to delay and unanticipated costs.\nThe availability of attractive site locations for new construction is subject to various factors that are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022 local conditions, such as scarcity of space or increase in demand for real estate, demographic changes and changes in zoning and tax laws; and\n\u2022 competition for site locations from both theatre companies and other businesses.\nWe typically require 18 to 24 months in the United States from the time we reach an agreement with a landlord to when a theatre opens.\nIn addition, the improvement of our existing theatres through our enhanced food and beverage and recliner re-seat initiatives is subject to substantial risks, such as difficulty in obtaining permits,\nlandlord approvals and new types of operating licenses (e.g. liquor licenses). We may also experience cost overruns from delays or other unanticipated costs in both new construction and facility improvements. Furthermore, our new sites and transformed locations may not perform to our expectations.\nWe may not achieve the expected benefits and performance from our strategic theatre acquisitions.\nIn any acquisition, we expect to benefit from cost savings through, for example, the reduction of overhead and theatre level costs, and from revenue enhancements resulting from the acquisition. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from these acquisitions to service any indebtedness incurred to finance such acquisitions or realize any other anticipated benefits. Nor can there be any assurance that our profitability will be improved by any one or more acquisitions. Although we have a long history of successfully integrating acquisitions, any acquisition may involve operating risks, such as:\n\u2022 the difficulty of assimilating and integrating the acquired operations and personnel into our current business;\n\u2022 the potential disruption of our ongoing business;\n\u2022 the diversion of management's attention and other resources;\n\u2022 the possible inability of management to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022 the risks of entering markets in which we have little or no experience;\n\u2022 the potential impairment of relationships with employees;\n\u2022 the possibility that any liabilities we may incur or assume may prove to be more burdensome than anticipated; and\n\u2022 the possibility that the acquired theatres do not perform as expected.\nIf our cash flows prove inadequate to service our debt and provide for our other obligations, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or future debt at terms unfavorable to us.\nOur ability to make payments on and refinance our debt and other financial obligations and to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow. This will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control.\nIn addition, our debt obligations require us to repay or refinance our obligations when they come due. If our cash flows were to prove inadequate to meet our debt service, rental and other obligations in the future, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing or future debt, on or before maturity, to sell assets or to obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including our Senior Secured Credit Facility and our notes, sell any such assets, or obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness restrict, but do not prohibit us from incurring additional indebtedness. If we are in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the Senior Secured Credit Facility and our other outstanding debt instruments, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness. If we incur additional indebtedness, the related risks that we face may intensify.\nWe rely on our information systems to conduct our business, and any failure to protect these systems against security breaches or failure of these systems themselves could adversely affect our business, results of operations and liquidity and could result in litigation and penalties. Additionally, if these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period of time, our business could be harmed.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware and software systems. Among other things, these systems collect and store certain personal information from customers, vendors and employees and process customer payment information. Additionally, open source internet ticketing allows tickets for all of our theatres to be sold by various third party vendors on websites using information systems we do not control. Our information systems and those maintained by our third party vendors and the sensitive data they are designed to protect are vulnerable to security breaches by computer hackers, cyber terrorists and other cyber attackers. We rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information maintained on our information systems, and we rely on our third party vendors to take appropriate measures to protect the confidentiality of the information on those information systems. However, these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches. Our information systems may become unavailable or fail to perform as anticipated for any reason, including viruses, loss of power or human error. Any significant interruption or failure of our information systems or those maintained by our third party vendors or any significant breach of security could adversely affect our reputation with our customers, vendors and employees and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. A significant interruption, failure or breach of the security of our information systems or those of our third party vendors could also require us to expend significant resources to upgrade the security measures and technology that guard sensitive data against computer hackers, cyber terrorists and other cyber attackers. We maintain cyber risk insurance coverage to protect against such risks, however, there can be no assurance that such coverage will be adequate.\nOur investment in and revenues from NCM may be negatively impacted by the competitive environment in which NCM operates.\nWe have maintained an investment in NCM. NCM's in-theatre advertising operations compete with other cinema advertising companies and other advertising mediums including, most notably, television, newspaper, radio and the Internet. There can be no guarantee that in-theatre advertising will continue to attract major advertisers or that NCM's in-theatre advertising format will be favorably received by the theatre-going public. If NCM is unable to generate expected sales of advertising, it may not maintain the level of profitability we hope to achieve, its results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected and our investment in and revenues and dividends from NCM may be adversely impacted.\nWe may suffer future impairment losses and theatre and other closure charges.\nThe opening of new theatres by us and certain of our competitors has drawn audiences away from some of our older theatres. In addition, demographic changes and competitive pressures have caused some of our theatres to become unprofitable. Since not all theatres are appropriate for our new initiatives, we may have to close certain theatres or recognize impairment losses related to the decrease in value of particular theatres. We review long-lived assets, including intangibles, marketable securities and non-consolidated entities for impairment as part of our annual budgeting process and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We recognized non-cash impairment losses in 1996 and in each fiscal year thereafter except for 2005, the Transition Period and calendar 2013. Our impairment losses of long-lived assets from continuing operations over this period aggregated to $301.3 million. Beginning fiscal 1999 through December 31, 2014, we also incurred theatre and other closure expenses, including theatre lease\ntermination charges aggregating approximately $153.7 million. Deterioration in the performance of our theatres could require us to recognize additional impairment losses and close additional theatres, which could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations. We continually monitor the performance of our theatres, and factors such as changing consumer preferences for filmed entertainment in international markets and our inability to sublease vacant retail space could negatively impact operating results and result in future closures, sales, dispositions and significant theatre and other closure charges prior to expiration of underlying lease agreements.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we incur legal liability.\nWe are subject to, and in the future may become a party to, a variety of litigation or other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Regardless of the merits of the claims, the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant, and such matters can be time-consuming and divert management's attention and resources. The results of litigation and other legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in materially adverse monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us. Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future.\nWhile we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable. Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if they prevail, the amount of our recovery.\nWe are subject to substantial government regulation, which could entail significant cost.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business, and we must comply with provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, equal employment, environmental, and licensing for the sale of food and, in some theatres, alcoholic beverages. Our new theatre openings could be delayed or prevented or our existing theatres could be impacted by difficulties or failures in our ability to obtain or maintain required approvals or licenses. Changes in existing laws or implementation of new laws, regulations and practices could have a significant impact on our business. A significant portion of our theatre level employees are part time workers who are paid at or near the applicable minimum wage in the theatre's jurisdiction. Increases in the minimum wage and implementation of reforms requiring the provision of additional benefits will increase our labor costs.\nWe own and operate facilities throughout the United States and are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of those jurisdictions, particularly laws governing the cleanup of hazardous materials and the management of properties. We might in the future be required to participate in the cleanup of a property that we own or lease, or at which we have been alleged to have disposed of hazardous materials from one of our facilities. In certain circumstances, we might be solely responsible for any such liability under environmental laws, and such claims could be material.\nOur theatres must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or ADA. Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations \"reasonably accommodate\" individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to \"commercial facilities\" conform to accessibility guidelines unless \"structurally impracticable\" for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations. Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, and an award of damages to private litigants or additional capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance.\nWe may not generate sufficient cash flows or have sufficient restricted payment capacity under our Senior Secured Credit Facility or the indentures governing our debt securities to pay our intended dividends on our Class A common stock.\nSubject to legally available funds, we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends. We are a holding company and have no direct operations. We will only be able to pay dividends from our available cash on hand and funds received from our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries' ability to make distributions to us will depend on their ability to generate substantial operating cash flow. Our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders are subject to the terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. Our operating cash flow and ability to comply with restricted payment covenants in our debt instruments will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. In addition, dividend payments are not mandatory or guaranteed, and our board of directors may decrease the level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends. We may not pay dividends as a result of the following additional factors, among others:\n\u2022 we are not legally or contractually required to pay dividends;\n\u2022 while we currently intend to pay a regular quarterly dividend, this policy could be modified or revoked at any time;\n\u2022 even if we do not modify or revoke our dividend policy, the actual amount of dividends distributed and the decision to make any distribution is entirely at the discretion of our board of directors and future dividends, if any, will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, business opportunities, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant;\n\u2022 the amount of dividends distributed is and will be subject to contractual restrictions under the restrictive payment covenants contained in:\n\u2022 the indentures governing our debt securities,\n\u2022 the terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facility, and\n\u2022 the terms of any other outstanding or future indebtedness incurred by us or any of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022 the amount of dividends distributed is subject to state law restrictions; and\n\u2022 our stockholders have no contractual or other legal right to dividends.\nThe maximum amount we would be permitted to distribute in compliance with our Senior Secured Credit Facility and the indentures governing our debt securities was approximately $713.5 million as of December 31, 2014. As a result of the foregoing limitations on our ability to make distributions, we cannot assure you that we will be able to make all of our intended quarterly dividend payments.\nAs a result of the IPO, Holdings and certain of its domestic affiliates may not be able to file a consolidated tax return which could result in increased tax liability.\nPrior to the IPO, Holdings and certain of its domestic affiliates (the \"AMC affiliated tax group\") are members of a consolidated group for federal income tax purposes, of which a Wanda domestic subsidiary is the common parent. As a result of the Class A common stock offering, the AMC affiliated tax group ceased to be members of the Wanda federal consolidated group. The AMC affiliated tax group will not be permitted to file a consolidated return for federal income tax purposes for five years, however, unless we obtain a waiver from the Internal Revenue Service. It is uncertain whether we will obtain a waiver if we seek one. If we do not obtain a waiver, each member of the AMC affiliated tax group will be required to file a separate federal income tax return, and, as a result, the income (and tax\nliability) of a member will only be offset by its own tax loss carryforwards (and other tax attributes) and not by tax loss carryforwards, current year losses or other tax attributes of other members of the group. We believe that we should not incur substantial additional federal tax liability if we are not permitted to file a federal consolidated return, because (i) most of our revenues are generated by a single member of the AMC affiliated tax group and most of our tax loss carryforwards are attributable to such member and (ii) there are certain other beneficial aspects of the structure of the AMC affiliated tax group. We cannot assure you, however, that we will not incur substantial additional tax liability if the AMC affiliated tax group is not permitted to file a federal consolidated return for five years.\nFuture sales of our Class A common stock could cause the market price for our Class A common stock to decline.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our Class A common stock or the availability of shares of our Class A common stock for sale will have on the market price of our Class A common stock prevailing from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales will occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline. Wanda holds shares of our Class B common stock, all of which constitute \"restricted securities\" under the Securities Act. The shares of our Class B common stock automatically convert to Class A common stock (1) if transferred to a person other than certain permitted transferees or (2) upon Wanda and its permitted transferees holding less than 30% of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. Provided the holders comply with the applicable volume limits and other conditions prescribed in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, all of these restricted securities are currently freely tradeable. Wanda also has the right, subject to various conditions and limitations, to request that we effect registered offerings of any Class A common stock they hold.\nWe have elected to take advantage of the \"controlled company\" exemption to the corporate governance rules for publicly-listed companies, which could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nBecause we qualify as a \"controlled company\" under the corporate governance rules for publicly-listed companies, we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. In light of our status as a controlled company, our board of directors has determined not to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, have a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors or have an independent nominating function and has chosen to have the full board of directors be directly responsible for nominating members of our board. Accordingly, should the interests of Wanda, as our controlling stockholder, differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for publicly-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nOur controlling shareholder owns more than 91% of the combined voting power of our common stock and has significant influence over our corporate management and affairs.\nOur Class B common stock has three votes per share, and our Class A common stock, which is the publicly traded stock, has one vote per share. As of December 31, 2014, Wanda owns approximately 75,826,927 shares of Class B common stock, or 77.86% of our outstanding common stock, representing approximately 91.34% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As such, Wanda has significant influence over our reporting and corporate management and affairs, and, because of the three-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, Wanda will continue to\ncontrol a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval (including election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers) so long as the shares of Class B common stock owned by Wanda and its permitted transferees represent at least 30% of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. The shares of our Class B common stock automatically convert to shares of Class A common stock upon Wanda and its permitted transferees holding less than 30% of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock.\nThe super voting rights of our Class B common stock and other anti-takeover protections in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may discourage or prevent a takeover of our Company, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as amended, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and the supermajority rights of our Class B common stockholder, could delay or make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors or for a third party to acquire us, even if a takeover would benefit our stockholders. These provisions include:\n\u2022 a dual class common stock structure, which provides Wanda with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;\n\u2022 a classified board of directors;\n\u2022 the sole power of a majority of the board of directors to fix the number of directors;\n\u2022 limitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022 the sole power of the board of directors to fill any vacancy on the board of directors, whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise;\n\u2022 the ability of our board of directors to designate one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval; and\n\u2022 the inability of stockholders to call special meetings.\nOur issuance of shares of preferred stock could delay or prevent a change of control of our Company. Our board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, in one or more series, to designate the number of shares constituting any series, and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company without further action by the stockholders, even where stockholders are offered a premium for their shares.\nOur incorporation under Delaware law, the ability of our board of directors to create and issue a new series of preferred stock or a stockholder rights plan and certain other provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving Holdings or the replacement of our management or discourage a potential investor from making a tender offer for our Class A common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market value of our Class A common stock.\nOur issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the common stockholders.\nThe issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our other classes of voting stock either by diluting the voting power of our other classes of voting stock if they vote together as a single class, or by giving the holders of any such preferred stock the right to block an action on which they have a separate class vote even if the action were approved by the holders of our other classes of voting stock.\nOur issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the market value of our Class A common stock.\nThe issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights, liquidation preferences or other economic terms favorable to the holders of preferred stock could adversely affect the market price for our Class A common stock by making an investment in the common stock less attractive. For example, investors in the common stock may not wish to purchase Class A common stock at a price above the conversion price of a series of convertible preferred stock because the holders of the preferred stock would effectively be entitled to purchase Class A common stock at the lower conversion price causing economic dilution to the holders of Class A common stock.", "PERMNO": 14328, "SIC": 7830, "TIC": "AMC"}
