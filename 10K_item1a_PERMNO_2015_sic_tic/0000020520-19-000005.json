{"cik": "20520", "company": "FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\ufeff\nBefore you make an investment decision with respect to any of our securities, you should carefully consider all the information we have included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent filings with the SEC. In particular, you should carefully consider the risk factors described below and the risks and uncertainties related to \u201cForward-Looking Statements,\u201d any of which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this annual report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing Frontier. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial or that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions, may also adversely affect our business and operations. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the balance of this annual report, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report.\n\ufeff\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\ufeff\nWe have experienced declining revenues and may experience further declines in our revenues going forward.\n\ufeff\nWe have experienced declining revenues as a result of declining voice services revenues, lower switched and nonswitched access revenues and declining video and data services revenues. Such declines have been driven primarily by customer losses, changing technology and consumer behavior (such as wireless displacement of wireline use, e-mail use, instant messaging and increasing use of VoIP), increased competition, regulatory constraints and financial decisions by governmental authorities. There can be no assurances that we will be able to stabilize or increase our revenues in the future. Future declines in our revenues could materially and adversely impact our ability to execute on our business strategy, comply with our financial covenants, repay our debts as they become due, negotiate with third parties or attract and retain employees.\n\ufeff\nIf our transformation program and other initiatives are unsuccessful, we may be unable to stabilize or grow our revenues and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nWe must produce adequate revenues and operating cash flows that, when combined with cash on hand and funds available under our revolving credit facility and other financings, will be sufficient to service our debt, fund our capital expenditures, pay our taxes, and fund our pension and other employee benefit obligations. We continue to experience revenue declines as compared to prior years. While we have identified potential areas of opportunity and implemented strategic initiatives, including opportunities to enhance revenue and realize productivity improvement, we cannot assure you that these efforts will be successful.\n\ufeff\nWe have established a transformation program with the objective of improving revenues, profitability, and cash flows by enhancing our operations and customer service and support processes. This program is a multi-year, comprehensive, strategic program that requires significant resources and may divert attention from ongoing operations and other strategic initiatives. We cannot assure you that the transformation program will achieve the anticipated results, or that we will not incur higher than anticipated costs when implementing the program. If the transformation program does not achieve the results we anticipate, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe face intense competition.\n\ufeff\nThe communications industry is extremely competitive. Through mergers and various service expansion strategies, service providers are striving to provide integrated solutions both within and across geographic markets. Our competitors include competitive local exchange carriers, Internet service providers, wireless companies, OTT, VoIP providers and cable companies, some of which may be subject to less regulation than we are. These entities may provide services competitive with the services that we offer or intend to introduce. For example, our competitors may seek to introduce networks in our markets that are competitive with or superior to our copper-based networks in those markets. We also believe that wireless and cable providers have increased their penetration of various services in our markets. We expect that competition will remain robust. Our revenue and cash flow will be adversely impacted if we cannot reverse our customer losses or continue to provide high-quality services.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe cannot predict which of the many possible future technologies, products or services will be important in order to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures will be required to develop and provide these technologies, products or services. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on the effectiveness of capital expenditure investments in our properties, our marketing efforts, our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including a changing regulatory environment that may affect our business and that of our competitors differently, new services that may be introduced, changes in consumer preferences, or habits, demographic trends, economic conditions and pricing strategies by competitors. Increasing competition may reduce our revenues and increase our marketing and other costs as well as require us to increase our capital expenditures and thereby decrease our cash flows.\n\ufeff\nWe may be unable to meet the technological needs or expectations of our customers, and may lose customers as a result.\n\ufeff\nThe telecommunications industry is subject to significant changes in technology, and replacing or upgrading our infrastructure to keep pace with such technological changes could result in significant capital expenditures. If we do not replace or upgrade technology and equipment and manage broadband speeds and capacity as necessary, we may be unable to compete effectively because we will not be able to meet the needs or expectations of our customers.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, enhancements to product offerings may influence our customers to consider other service providers, such as cable operators or wireless providers. We may be unable to attract new or retain existing customers from cable companies due to their deployment of enhanced broadband and VoIP technology. In addition, new capacity services for wireless broadband technologies may permit our competitors to offer broadband data services to our customers throughout most or all of our service areas. Any resulting inability to attract new or retain existing customers could adversely impact our business and results of operations in a material manner.\n\ufeff\nSome of our competitors have superior resources, which may place us at a disadvantage.\n\ufeff\nSome of our competitors have market presence, engineering, technical, marketing and financial capabilities which are substantially greater than ours. In addition, some of these competitors are able to raise capital at a lower cost than we are able to. Consequently, some of these competitors may be able to develop and expand their communications and network infrastructures more quickly, adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, including leading edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and various types of data science, as well as take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services than we will be able to. Additionally, the greater brand name recognition of some competitors may require us to price our services at lower levels in order to retain or obtain customers. Finally, the cost advantages and greater financial resources of some of these competitors may give them the ability to reduce their prices for an extended period of time if they so choose. Our business and results of operations may be materially adversely impacted if we are not able to effectively compete.\n\ufeff\nWeak economic conditions may decrease demand for our services or necessitate increased discounts.\n\ufeff\nWe could be adversely impacted by weak economic conditions or their effects. Downturns in the economy and competition in our markets have in the past, and could in the future, cause some of our customers to reduce or eliminate their purchases of our basic and enhanced voice services, broadband and video services and make it difficult for us to obtain new customers or retain existing customers. In addition, if economic conditions are depressed or further deteriorate, our customers may delay or discontinue payment for our services or seek more competitive pricing from other service providers, or we may be required to offer increased discounts in order to retain our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe rely on network and information systems and other technology, and a disruption or failure of such networks, systems or technology as a result of computer viruses, cyber-attacks, misappropriation of data or other malfeasance, as well as outages, accidental releases of information or similar events, may disrupt our business and materially impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nOur information technology networks and infrastructure may be subject to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to computer viruses, cyber-attacks or breaches, employee or third-party error or malfeasance, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters or other catastrophic events.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFurther, our network and information systems are subject to various risks related to third parties and other parties we may not fully control. We use encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide secure transmission of confidential information, including our business data and customer information. Similarly, we rely on employees in our network operations centers, data centers, call centers and retail stores to follow our procedures when handling sensitive information. While we select our third-party business partners and employees carefully, we do not always control their actions, which could expose us to cyber-security risks. In addition, our customers using our network to access the Internet may become victim to malicious and abusive Internet activities, such as unsolicited mass advertising (or spam), peer-to-peer file sharing, distribution of viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software; these activities could adversely affect our network, result in excessive call volume at our call centers and damage our or our customers\u2019 equipment and data.\n\ufeff\nWhile we maintain security measures, disaster recovery plans and business continuity plans for our business and are continuously working to upgrade our existing technology systems and provide employee training around the cyber risks we face, these risks are constantly evolving and are challenging to mitigate. Like many companies, we are the subject of increasingly frequent cyber-attacks. Any unauthorized access, computer viruses, accidental or intentional release of confidential information or other disruptions could result in misappropriation of our or our customers\u2019 sensitive information; financial loss; reputational harm; increased costs, such as those relating to remediation or future protection; customer dissatisfaction, which could lead to a decline in customers and revenue; and legal claims or proceedings, fines and other liabilities. There can be no assurance that the impact of such incidents would not be material to our results of operations, financial condition or cash.\n\ufeff\nOur business is sensitive to the creditworthiness of our wholesale customers.\n\ufeff\nWe have substantial business relationships with other communications carriers for which we provide service. While bankruptcies or insolvency of these carriers have not had a material adverse effect on our business in recent years, future bankruptcies or insolvencies in the industry could result in the loss of significant customers, as well as cause more price competition and an increased allowance for doubtful accounts receivable. Such bankruptcies and insolvencies may be more likely in the future if economic conditions stagnate. As a result, our revenues and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nA significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions.\n\ufeff\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 21,200 employees. Approximately 15,000 of our total employees were represented by unions and were subject to collective bargaining agreements. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 100 employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expired in 2017 or 2018, but have been extended and are still effective for 2019. Of the union-represented employees as of December 31, 2018, approximately 4,500, or 30%, of the unionized workforce are covered by collective agreements that expire in 2019 and approximately 4,800, or 32%, of the unionized workforce are covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire in 2020.\n\ufeff\nWe cannot predict the outcome of negotiations of the collective bargaining agreements covering our employees. If we are unable to reach new agreements or renew existing agreements, employees subject to collective bargaining agreements may engage in strikes, work slowdowns or other labor actions, which could materially disrupt our ability to provide services. New labor agreements or the renewal of existing agreements may impose significant new costs on us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\n\ufeff\nIf we are unable to hire or retain key personnel, we may be unable to operate our business successfully.\n\ufeff\nOur success will depend in part upon the continued services of our management team. We cannot guarantee that our key personnel will not leave or compete with us. The loss, incapacity or unavailability for any reason of key members of our management team could have a material impact on our business. In addition, our financial results and our ability to compete may suffer if we are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits of recent acquisitions.\n\ufeff\nIn recent years, we have completed multiple acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to realize the full benefit of any anticipated growth opportunities or scale benefits from such acquisitions or that these benefits will be realized within the expected time frames.\n\ufeff\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet. We recorded goodwill impairments in 2017 and 2018 and if our goodwill or other intangible assets become further impaired, we may be required to record additional non-cash charges to earnings and reduce our stockholders\u2019 equity.\n\ufeff\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles, intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Frontier monitors relevant circumstances, including general economic conditions, enterprise value EBITDA multiples for other providers of communications services, our overall financial performance, and the market prices for our stock, and the potential impact that changes in such circumstances might have on the valuation of Frontier\u2019s goodwill or other intangible assets. On a quarterly basis we evaluate goodwill to assess possible triggering events which would be indicative of possible impairment. As a result of the continued decline in the share price of our common stock we had triggering events in the final three quarters of 2018 and each of the four quarters of 2017. Our quantitative assessments in the third and fourth quarters of 2018 and the second and fourth quarters of 2017 indicated that the carrying value of the enterprise exceeded its fair value and, therefore, an impairment existed. We recorded goodwill impairments totaling $641 million for 2018 and $2,748 million for 2017. If our goodwill or other intangible assets are determined to be further impaired in the future, we may be required to record a non-cash charge to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined, which would reduce our stockholders\u2019 equity.\n\ufeff\nWe may complete a future significant strategic transaction that may not achieve intended results. To the extent we consummate such a transaction, we may experience operational challenges in integrating or segregating assets and such transaction could increase the number of our outstanding shares or amount of outstanding debt.\n\ufeff\nWe continuously evaluate and may in the future enter into additional strategic transactions. Any such transaction could happen at any time, could be material to our business and could take any number of forms, including, for example, an acquisition, merger, sale of certain of our assets, refinancing, or other recapitalization or material strategic transaction. Evaluating potential transactions and integrating completed ones may divert the attention of our management from ordinary operating matters.\n\ufeff\nThe success of potential acquisitions or mergers will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies through the successful integration of the businesses we acquire with our existing business. Even if we are successful in integrating acquired businesses, we cannot assure you that these integrations will result in the realization of the full benefit of any anticipated growth opportunities or cost synergies or that these benefits will be realized within the expected time frames. In addition, acquired businesses may have unanticipated liabilities or contingencies.\n\ufeff\nIn the past, we have disposed of assets for a variety of reasons, and we may, from time to time, consider disposing of other assets or asset groups in the future. We may not be able to dispose of any such assets on terms that are attractive to us, or at all, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operation. In addition, to the extent we consummate an agreement for the sale and disposition of an asset or asset group, we may experience operational difficulties segregating them from our retained assets and operations, which could impact the execution or timing for such dispositions and could result in disruptions to our operations and/or claims for damages, among other things.\n\ufeff\nIf we complete an acquisition, merger, sale of certain assets, refinancing, recapitalization or material strategic transaction, we may require additional financing that could result in an increase in the number of our outstanding shares of stock or the aggregate amount and/or cost of our debt, which may result in an adverse impact to our ratings. The number of shares of our stock or the aggregate principal amount of our debt that we may issue may be significant. Moreover, the terms of any debt financing may be expensive or adversely impact our results of operations.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nNegotiations with the providers of content for our video systems may not be successful, potentially resulting in our inability to carry certain programming channels on our FiOS and Vantage video systems, which could result in the loss of subscribers. Alternatively, because of the power of some content providers, we may be forced to pay an increasing amount for some content, resulting in higher expenses and lower profitability.\n\ufeff\nWe must negotiate with the content owners of the programming that we carry on our multichannel video systems (marketed as FiOS video and Vantage video). These content owners are the exclusive provider of the channels they offer. If we are unable to reach a mutually-agreed contract with a content owner, including pricing and carriage provisions, our existing agreements to carry this content may not be renewed, resulting in the blackout of these channels. The loss of content could result in our loss of customers who place a high value on the particular content that is lost. In addition, many content providers own multiple channels. As a result, we typically have to negotiate the pricing for multiple channels rather than one, and carry and pay for content that customers do not value, in order to have access to other content that customers do value. Some of our competitors have materially larger scale than we do, and may, as a result, be better positioned than we are in such negotiations. As a result of these factors, the expense of content acquisition may continue to increase, and this could result in higher expenses and lower profitability.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements.\n\ufeff\nWe are party to various legal proceedings, including, from time to time, individual actions, class and putative class actions, and governmental investigations, covering a wide range of matters and types of claims including, but not limited to, general contract disputes, billing disputes, rights of access, taxes and surcharges, consumer protection, advertising, sales and the provision of services, trademark and patent infringement, employment, regulatory, tort, claims of competitors and disputes with carriers. Litigation is subject to uncertainty and the outcome if individual matters is not predictable. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or enter into settlements with governmental or other entities which impose significant financial and business remediation measures.\n\ufeff\nWe and other providers of VoIP service have been the target of recent intellectual property\ninfringement litigation, which could have a material and adverse impact on our business.\n\ufeff\nWe and other providers of VoIP service have been, and may in the future be, the target of intellectual property infringement litigation with respect to patents related to the provision of VoIP service. In April 2018, Sprint filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that Frontier infringes 15 patents purportedly relating to VoIP services. Some of these actions have recently been resolved in a manner adverse to other VoIP providers, including significant settlement amounts and a substantial jury award. While we believe these claims are without merit and intend to defend against such lawsuits vigorously, we cannot at this time predict the outcome of these lawsuits or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. If any of these matters are resolved in plaintiff's favor, including if we choose to settle any such matters, our business and financial position could be materially and adversely impacted.\n\ufeff\nWe rely on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors.\n\ufeff\nWe depend on a number of suppliers and vendors for equipment and services relating to our network infrastructure, including network elements such as digital and internet protocol switching and routing equipment, optical and copper transmission equipment, broadband connectivity equipment, various forms of customer premise equipment, optical fiber, wireless equipment, as well as the software that is used throughout our network to manage traffic, network elements, and other functions critical to our operations. If any of our major suppliers were to experience disruption, supply-chain interruptions, financial difficulties, or other unforeseen problems delivering, maintaining, or servicing these network components on a timely basis, our operations could suffer significantly. In addition, due to changes in the communications industry, the suppliers of many of these products and services have been consolidating. In the event it were to become necessary to seek alternative suppliers and vendors, we may be unable to obtain satisfactory replacement supplies, services, or utilities on economically-attractive terms, on a timely basis, or at all, which could increase costs or cause disruptions in our services.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRisks Related to Liquidity, Financial Resources and Capitalization\n\ufeff\nWe currently have a significant amount of indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, and are contractually permitted to incur substantial additional indebtedness and grant substantial additional liens in the future. Such debt and debt service obligations may adversely affect us.\n\ufeff\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, which amounted to $17.4 billion outstanding at December 31, 2018, of which $5.4 billion was secured. We also have access to a $850 million secured Revolving Credit Facility, of which $275 million was drawn as of December 31, 2018.\n\ufeff\nWe may also be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the terms of the indentures governing our second lien secured notes (the second lien notes) and senior unsecured notes (the senior notes and, together with the second lien notes, the notes) and the terms of our credit facilities restrict our and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens, such restrictions are subject to several exceptions and qualifications, and the indebtedness and/or liens incurred in compliance with such restrictions may be substantial. In addition, these terms do not prevent us or our restricted subsidiaries from incurring various types of obligations that do not constitute \u201cindebtedness\u201d under these terms. To the extent other new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 current debt levels, the substantial leverage risks described below would increase.\n\ufeff\nThe potential significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations that could result from our substantial debt include:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nlimitations on our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms or at all;\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\ninstances in which we are unable to comply with the covenants contained in our indentures and credit agreements or to generate cash sufficient to make required debt payments, which circumstances have the potential of accelerating the maturity of some or all of our outstanding indebtedness;\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nthe possibility that we may trigger the springing maturity provisions in our credit agreements;\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nthe allocation of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thus reducing the amount of our cash flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and dividends that would otherwise improve our competitive position, results of operations or stock price;\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nrequiring us to issue debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations;\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\ncompromising our flexibility to plan for, or react to, competitive challenges in our business and the telecommunications industry; and\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nthe possibility of our being put at a competitive disadvantage with competitors who, relative to their size, do not have as much debt as we do, and competitors who may be in a more favorable position to access additional capital resources.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, our senior notes and debentures and our second lien notes are rated below \u201cinvestment grade\u201d by independent rating agencies. This has resulted in higher borrowing costs for us. These rating agencies may lower our debt ratings further, if in the rating agencies\u2019 judgment such an action is appropriate. A further lowering of a rating would likely increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital. Our negotiations with vendors, customers and business partners can be negatively impacted if they deem us a credit risk as a result of our credit rating.\n\ufeff\nThe indentures and agreements governing our debt, including our senior notes and debentures, our second lien notes and our credit facilities, contain covenants that impose restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries that may affect our ability to operate our business, and make payments on our debt.\n\ufeff\nThe indentures and agreements governing our existing indebtedness contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to:\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nincur additional indebtedness, guarantee indebtedness or issue preferred stock;\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\ncreate liens;\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nmake certain investments or make other restricted payments;\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nenter into mergers or consolidations, or transfer or sell all or substantially all of our assets;\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\npay dividends on, or make distributions in respect of, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nmake certain asset sales;\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nenter into restrictions affecting the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to make distributions, loans or advances to us or other subsidiaries; and\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nengage in transactions with affiliates.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, our credit facilities require us to comply with specified covenants, including financial ratios. Any future indebtedness may also require us to comply with similar or other covenants.\n\ufeff\nThese restrictions on our ability to operate our business could seriously harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financings, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities.\n\ufeff\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. This could have serious consequences to our financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent.\n\ufeff\nFrontier is primarily a holding company and, as a result, we rely on the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries in order to meet our cash needs and service our indebtedness, including our senior notes and debentures and our second lien notes.\n\ufeff\nFrontier is primarily a holding company and our principal assets consist of the shares of capital stock or other equity instruments of our subsidiaries. As a holding company, we depend on dividends, distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, including those arising under our senior notes and debentures and our second lien notes, and meet our cash needs. We cannot assure you that the operating results of our subsidiaries at any given time will be sufficient to make dividends, distributions or other payments to us in order to allow us to make payments on our indebtedness. In addition, the payment of these dividends, distributions and other payments, as well as other transfers of assets, between our subsidiaries and from our subsidiaries to us may be subject to legal, regulatory or contractual restrictions. Some state regulators have imposed, and others may consider imposing on regulated companies, including us, cash management practices that could limit the ability of such regulated companies to transfer cash between subsidiaries or to the parent company. While none of the existing state regulations materially affects our cash management, any changes to the existing regulations or imposition of new regulations or restrictions may materially adversely affect our ability to transfer cash within our consolidated companies.\n\ufeff\nOur senior notes and debentures are structurally subordinated to liabilities of our subsidiaries.\n\ufeff\nOur subsidiaries have not guaranteed our senior notes and debentures. As a result, holders of such securities will not have any claim as a creditor against our subsidiaries. Accordingly, all obligations of our subsidiaries (including any liens granted by our subsidiaries on any of their assets to secure any of our obligations) will have to be satisfied before any of the assets of such subsidiaries would be available for distribution, upon a liquidation or otherwise. In addition, our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional debt (including secured debt),\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nsubject to the contractual limitations in our debt instruments applicable to such subsidiaries. Holders of our senior notes and debentures would be structurally subordinated to any such future debt as well.\n\ufeff\nOur senior notes and debentures are unsecured and subordinated to our secured indebtedness.\n\ufeff\nOur senior notes and debentures are unsecured and therefore are subordinated to our existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. At December 31, 2018, our secured indebtedness consisted of second lien notes, obligations under the JPM Credit Agreement, the CoBank Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Agreement, Term Loan B and the Continuing Agreement for Standby Letters of Credit between Frontier and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch and Bank of Tokyo - Mitsubishi UFJ, LTD, each of which is secured by the security package under the JPM Credit Agreement which includes pledges of the equity interests in certain Frontier subsidiaries and guarantees by certain Frontier subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the assets that serve as collateral for our secured indebtedness will be available to satisfy the obligations under the secured indebtedness before any payments are made on the senior notes and debentures from the proceeds of such assets. The indentures governing our senior notes and debentures permit us, subject to specified limitations, to incur a substantial amount of additional secured debt.\n\ufeff\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase.\n\ufeff\nAt December 31, 2018, approximately 21% of our total debt is subject to variable rates of interest. Borrowings under our credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we might not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into might not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\n\ufeff\nWe may be unable to refinance our indebtedness.\n\ufeff\nWe may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity. We may not be able to obtain sufficient funds to enable us to repay or refinance our debt obligations, including our credit facilities, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Failure to repay or refinance our debt obligations on a timely basis could result in a default under the agreements governing any such debt and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations, which could have serious consequences to our financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent.\n\ufeff\nWe may not have sufficient funds to repurchase our second lien notes or senior notes upon a change of control triggering event.\n\ufeff\nThe terms of our secured notes and senior notes require us to make an offer to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control and Ratings Decline (as defined in the indentures governing the notes) at a purchase price equal to 101% of the respective principal amounts of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of the purchase. It is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of such a change of control triggering event to make the required repurchase of the applicable series of notes and will be required to obtain third party financing to do so. We may not be able to obtain this financing on commercially reasonable terms, or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, the occurrence of certain change of control events may constitute an event of default under the terms of our credit facilities. Such an event of default would entitle the lenders under our credit facilities to, among other things, cause all outstanding debt thereunder to become due and payable.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe expect to make contributions to our pension plan in future years, the amount of which will be impacted by volatility in asset values related to Frontier\u2019s pension plan and/or changes in pension plan assumptions.\n\ufeff\nFrontier made contributions of $150 million in 2018 and $75 million, net of the Differential payment received (see note 18), to its pension plan in 2017, and we expect to continue to make contributions in future years. Volatility in our asset values, liability calculations, or returns may impact the costs of maintaining our pension plan and our future funding requirements. Any future material contribution could have a negative impact on our liquidity by reducing cash flows.\nSignificant changes in discount rates, rates of return on pension assets, mortality tables and other factors could adversely affect our earnings and equity and increase our pension funding requirements.\n\ufeff\nPension costs and obligations are determined using actual results as well as actuarial valuations that involve several assumptions. The most critical assumptions are the discount rate, the long-term expected return on assets and mortality tables. Other assumptions include salary increases, lump sum payments, and retirement age. Some of these assumptions, such as the discount rate and return on pension assets, are reflective of economic conditions and largely out of our control. Changes in the pension assumptions could adversely affect our earnings, equity and funding requirements.\n\ufeff\nWe may not be able to fully utilize our net operating loss and other tax carry forwards.\n\ufeff\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had federal net operating loss (\u201cNOLs\u201d) carryforwards of approximately $2.4 billion that we may use to offset against taxable income. However, our ability to utilize these NOLs may be limited in the future.\n\ufeff\nA corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is typically subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-ownership change NOLs to offset future taxable income. In general, under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders (generally 5% stockholders, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years). Purchases or sales of our common stock in amounts greater than specified levels, which are generally beyond our control, could create a limitation on our ability to utilize our NOLs for tax purposes in the future. Limitations imposed on our ability to utilize NOLs could cause U.S. federal and state income taxes to be paid earlier than would be paid if such limitations were not in effect.\n\ufeff\nFurthermore, we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our NOLs before they expire. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the TCJA) (i) the amount of NOLs generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 that we are permitted to deduct in any taxable year is limited to 80% of our taxable income in such year, and (ii) NOLs generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 cannot be carried back to prior taxable years. Moreover, NOLs incurred in one state may not be available to offset income earned in a different state and there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited for state tax purposes, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. If any of these events occur, we may not derive some or all of the expected benefits from our NOLs.\n\ufeff\nRisks Related to Regulation and Oversight\n\ufeff\nChanges in federal or state regulations may reduce the switched access charge revenues we receive.\n\ufeff\nA portion of Frontier\u2019s total revenues ($125 million, or 1%, in 2018 and $165 million, or 2%, in 2017) are derived from switched access charges paid by other carriers for services we provide in originating intrastate and interstate long-distance traffic. Frontier expects a portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from switched access charges paid by these carriers for these services. The rates Frontier can charge for switched access are regulated by the FCC and state regulatory agencies.\n\ufeff\nIn 2011, the FCC adopted the 2011 Order regarding Intercarrier Compensation, which is the payment framework that governs how carriers compensate each other for the exchange of voice traffic between carriers. However, the 2011 Order did not resolve all questions on Intercarrier Compensation. The FCC continues to consider the possibility of transitioning originating access rates in the future. We cannot predict when or how the FCC would\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nimplement any changes originating access rates, and future reductions in these revenues may directly affect our profitability and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nIn April 2017, the FCC issued an order that resulted in substantial deregulation in a number of our markets for special access services where the market is determined to be competitive and the transport market nationwide. Some aspects of the 2017 Order were appealed by stakeholders. The 8th Circuit issued a decision that upheld the majority of the 2017 Order. The part of the decision that was vacated and remanded to the FCC is currently stayed allowing the FCC an opportunity to resolve it. We cannot predict the outcome of that appeal or the impact of future changes on our results or operations.\n\ufeff\nCertain states also have their own open proceedings to address reform to originating intrastate access charges, other intercarrier compensation, and state universal service funds. Although the FCC has pre-empted state jurisdiction on most access charges, many states could consider moving forward with their proceedings. We cannot predict when or how these matters will be decided or the effect on our subsidy or switched access revenues. However, future reductions in our subsidy or switched access revenues may directly affect our profitability and cash flows as those regulatory revenues do not have an equal level of associated variable expenses.\n\ufeff\nA portion of Frontier\u2019s revenues are derived from federal and state subsidies. To the extent the federal or any state government reduces such subsidies, our operating income could be materially and adversely impacted.\n\ufeff\nA portion of Frontier\u2019s total revenues ($378 million, or 4%, in 2018 and $395 million, or 4%, in 2017) are derived from federal and state subsidies for rural and high-cost support, that consists of CAF II support, Federal High Cost support, and various state subsidies. The FCC\u2019s 2011 Order changed how federal subsidies are calculated and disbursed. These changes transitioned the USF (Universal Service Fund), which supported voice services in high-cost areas, to the CAF (Connect America Fund), which supports broadband deployment in high-cost areas. Federal subsidies represented approximately 93% of subsidy revenue in 2018 and 92% in 2017, with the remainder being state subsidies.\n\ufeff\nFrontier is required to contribute to the USF and the FCC allows Frontier to recover these contributions through a USF surcharge on customers\u2019 bills. This surcharge accounted for $213 million of revenue in 2018 and $216 million in 2017.\n\ufeff\nFuture reductions in these subsidies, or in our ability to recover USF contributions, could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\n\ufeff\nFrontier and our industry will likely remain highly regulated, and we could incur substantial compliance costs that could constrain our ability to compete in our target markets.\n\ufeff\nAs an incumbent local exchange carrier, some of the services we offer are subject to significant regulation from federal, state and local authorities. This regulation could impact our ability to change our rates, especially on our basic voice services and our access rates, and could impose substantial compliance costs on us. In some jurisdictions, regulation may restrict our ability to expand our service offerings. In addition, changes to the regulations that govern our business may have an adverse effect on our business by reducing the allowable fees that we may charge, imposing additional compliance costs, reducing the amount of subsidies or otherwise changing the nature of our operations and the competition in our industry. At this time, it is unknown how these regulations or changes to these regulations will affect Frontier\u2019s operations or ability to compete in the future.\n\ufeff\nFCC rulemakings and state regulatory proceedings, including those relating to intercarrier compensation, universal service and broadband services, could have a substantial adverse impact on our operations.\n\ufeff\nOur Internet access offerings could become subject to additional laws and regulations as they are adopted or applied to the Internet. As the significance of the Internet expands, federal, state and local governments may pass laws and adopt rules and regulations, including those directed at privacy, or apply existing laws and regulations to the Internet (including Internet access services), and related matters are under consideration in both federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies. Although the FCC has pre-empted state jurisdiction on network neutrality and privacy, many states, including California, have considered or are moving forward with legislation on these or other Internet-related issues. Multiple states have taken executive or legislative action directed at reinstating aspects of the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFCC\u2019s 2015 Order. We cannot predict whether the outcome of expected or pending challenges to the FCC\u2019s order or subsequent state actions will prove beneficial or detrimental to our competitive position.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to the oversight of certain federal and state agencies that have in the past, and may in the future, investigate or pursue enforcement actions against us relating to consumer protection matters.\n\ufeff\nCertain federal and state agencies, including state attorneys general, monitor and exercise oversight related to consumer protection matters, including those affecting the communications industry. Such agencies have in the past, and may in the future, choose to launch an inquiry or investigation of our business practices in response to customer complaints or other publicized customer service issues or disruptions. Such inquiries or investigations could result in reputational harm, enforcement actions, litigation, fines, settlements and/or operational and financial conditions being placed on the company, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business.\n\ufeff\nTax legislation may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nTax laws are dynamic and continually change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the TCJA. The TCJA makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code and, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, and imposes limitations on the use of net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate results in a decreased valuation of our deferred tax asset and liabilities. The overall impact of the new federal tax law is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law. The determination of the benefit from (provision for) income taxes requires complex estimations, significant judgments and significant knowledge and experience concerning the applicable tax laws. The current assessment on the impact to deferred tax assets (liabilities) for applying the requirements of the TCJA is based on the currently available information and guidance. If in the future any element of the tax reform changes the related accounting guidance for income tax, it could affect our income tax position and we may need to adjust the benefit from (provision for) income taxes accordingly.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES", "PERMNO": 23887, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "FTRCQ"}
