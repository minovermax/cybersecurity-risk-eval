{"cik": "1368265", "company": "Clean Energy Fuels Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our Company involves a high degree of risk of loss. You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below and all of the other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K before you decide to purchase shares of our common stock. We believe the risks and uncertainties described below are the most significant we face. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and reputation and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business.\nWe have a history of losses and may incur additional losses in the future.\nIn 2013, 2014 and 2015, we incurred pre-tax losses of $63.2 million, $89.9 million, and $133.8 million, respectively. During these periods our losses were substantially decreased by approximately $45.4 million, $28.4 million and $31.0 million of revenue, respectively, from the VETC alternative fuels tax credits. We may continue to incur increasing losses or never achieve or maintain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition, and may cause the price of our common stock to fall.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt.\nAt December 31, 2015, our total consolidated indebtedness was approximately $572.4 million which includes amounts incurred under the 7.5% Notes, SLG Notes, 5.25% Notes and Canton Bonds, each of which is defined and discussed in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements and under \u201cContractual Obligations\u201d in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. In addition, in February 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement with, and issued a related promissory note to, PlainsCapital Bank, pursuant to which we have obtained a loan in the principal amount of up to $50.0 million. See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements and Item 9B. Other Information of this report for further information about our loan from PlainsCapital Bank. As of December 31, 2015 approximately $150.1 million, $5.5 million, $305.1 million, $54.7 million, $53.1 million and $4.0 million of our consolidated indebtedness matures in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and thereafter, respectively. We expect our total consolidated interest payment obligations relating to our indebtedness to be approximately $32.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2016\nAlthough we do not have a specific plan regarding the repurchase, redemption or restructuring of our outstanding indebtedness, we generally intend to make payments under our various debt instruments when due and pursue opportunities for earlier repayment if and when opportunities arise. With respect to certain of our outstanding indebtedness due in 2016, we anticipate repaying, with a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, all or some portion of the outstanding principal amount of the SLG Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest, on or prior to their August 2016 maturity date. To this end, on March 1, 2016 and pursuant to the consent of the holders of the SLG Notes, we prepaid an aggregate of $60.0 million in principal amount and $1.8 million in accrued and unpaid interest owed under the SLG Notes. In addition, with respect to certain of our outstanding indebtedness due in 2018, in February 2016, in light of discounted trading prices of our 5.25% Notes and other factors, our board of directors authorized and approved our use of up to $25.0 million to opportunistically purchase in the open market our outstanding 5.25% Notes. Pursuant to such approval, on February 18, 2016, we paid $16.8 million in cash to repurchase $32.5 million in face amount of our 5.25% Notes due 2018, plus accrued interest. Upon our purchase, such 5.25% Notes were surrendered to the trustee for such notes and canceled.\nOur ability to make payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness, whether at or prior to their due dates, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors, including those described in these risk factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service our debt. If we are, or if we expect that we will be, unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or obtaining additional equity capital or debt financing on terms that may be onerous to us or highly dilutive to our stockholders. Our ability to pursue any of these avenues, should we decide to do so, would depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms or at the desirable time, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. Additionally, certain of the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants and any failure by us to comply with any of these covenants could also cause us to be in default under the agreements governing the indebtedness. In the event of any such default, the holders of the indebtedness could, among other things, elect to declare all amounts owed immediately due and payable, which could cause all or a large portion of our available cash flow to be used to pay such amounts and thereby reduce the amount of cash available to pursue our business plans or force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In addition, the substantial amount of our indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences. For example, it could make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry and competitive conditions and government regulations, limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry, place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt or limit our ability to borrow additional amounts as needed.\nWe are permitted to repay up to $295.0 million of our consolidated indebtedness outstanding at December 31, 2015 at maturity with shares of our common stock rather than cash, with the amount of shares determined by the then-current trading price of our common stock. Any such issuance would increase the number of our outstanding shares and may significantly dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders.\nWe may need to raise additional capital to continue to fund the growth of our business or repay our debt.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $43.7 million and short-term investments of $102.9 million. Our business plan calls for approximately $25.5 million in capital expenditures for 2016, as well as additional capital expenditures thereafter. We may also require capital to make principal or interest payments on our indebtedness, either prior to or at their maturity dates, or for unanticipated expenses, mergers and acquisitions and strategic investments. As a result, we may find it necessary to raise additional capital through selling assets or pursuing debt or equity financing.\nAsset sales and equity or debt financing options may not be available when needed on terms favorable to us, or at all. Any sale of our assets may limit our operational capacity and could limit or eliminate any business plans that are dependent on the sold assets. Additional issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock would increase the number of our outstanding shares and dilute the ownership interest of our then-existing stockholders. We may also pursue debt financing, such as our February 2016 loan from PlainsCapital Bank,since, despite our level of consolidated debt, the agreements governing much of our existing debt do not restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, including secured and unsecured indebtedness, or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. Debt financing options that we may pursue include, among others, equipment financing, sales of convertible notes, high-yield debt, asset-based loans, term loans, project finance debt, municipal bond financing, loans secured by receivables or inventory or commercial bank financing. Any debt financing we obtain may require us to make significant interest payments and to pledge some or all of our assets as security. In addition, higher levels of indebtedness could increase our risk of non-repayment and could adversely affect our creditworthiness, which could limit our ability to obtain further debt or equity financing as needed and restrict our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions. Further, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing any future capital-raising transactions, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. On the other hand, if we are unable to obtain capital in amounts sufficient to fund our contractual obligations, business plan, unanticipated expenses, capital expenditures, mergers, acquisitions or strategic investments, we would be forced to suspend, delay or curtail these plans, expenditures or other transactions, which could negatively affect our business and prospects.\nOur success is dependent upon fleets\u2019 and other consumers\u2019 willingness to adopt natural gas as a vehicle fuel.\nOur success is highly dependent upon the adoption by fleets and other consumers of natural gas as a vehicle fuel. Factors that may influence the adoption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel include, among others, those discussed in these risk factors. If the market for natural gas as a vehicle fuel does not develop as we expect or develops more slowly than we expect, or if a market does develop but we are not able to capture a significant share of the market or the market subsequently declines, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be harmed. The market for natural gas as a vehicle fuel is a relatively new and developing market characterized by intense competition, evolving government regulation and industry standards and changing consumer demands and behaviors.\nFactors that may influence the adoption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel include, among others:\n\u2022\nIncreases, decreases or volatility in the price of oil, gasoline, diesel and natural gas;\n\u2022\nThe availability of natural gas and the price of natural gas compared to gasoline, diesel and other vehicle fuels;\n\u2022\nNatural gas vehicle cost, availability, quality, safety, design and performance, all relative to other vehicles;\n\u2022\nImprovements in the efficiency, fuel economy or greenhouse gas emissions of engines for gasoline, diesel and alternative fuel vehicles;\n\u2022\nThe entry or exit of engine manufacturers from the market;\n\u2022\nPerceptions about greenhouse gas emissions (also known as \u201cfugitive methane emissions\u201d) from natural gas production and transportation methods, natural gas fueling stations and natural gas vehicles;\n\u2022\nThe availability and acceptance of other alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles;\n\u2022\nThe existence of government programs, policies, regulations or incentives promoting other alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles;\n\u2022\nAccess to natural gas fueling stations and the convenience and cost to fuel a natural gas vehicle;\n\u2022\nThe availability of service for natural gas vehicles;\n\u2022\nThe environmental consciousness of fleets and consumers; and\n\u2022\nThe existence and success of tax credits, government incentives and grant programs that promote the use of natural gas as a vehicle fuel.\nIncreases, decreases and general volatility in oil, gasoline, diesel and natural gas prices could adversely impact our business.\nIn recent years, the prices of oil, gasoline, diesel and natural gas have been volatile, and this volatility may continue. Market adoption of CNG, LNG and RNG as vehicle fuels could be slowed or limited if there are significant decreases in the prices of, or significant increases in the supply and availability of, gasoline and diesel, today\u2019s most prevalent and conventional vehicle fuels, which would decrease the market\u2019s perception of a need for alternative vehicle fuels generally, or if there are decreases in the prices of gasoline and diesel without a corresponding decrease in the price of natural gas or an increase in the price of natural gas without corresponding increases in the prices of gasoline and diesel. Any of these circumstances could cause the success or perceived success of our industry and our business to materially suffer. Part of the reason that such slowed or limited adoption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel might occur under these circumstances is due to the higher cost of natural gas vehicles compared to gasoline or diesel-powered vehicles, as the components needed for a vehicle to use natural gas add to a vehicle\u2019s base cost. If gasoline or diesel prices drop significantly, fuel economy of gasoline- or diesel-powered vehicles improves, or the prices of CNG and LNG are not sufficiently low, operators may delay or refrain from purchasing natural gas vehicles or decide not to convert their existing vehicles to run on natural gas because of a perceived inability to recover in a timely manner the additional costs of acquiring or converting to natural gas vehicles. In addition, our profit margins are directly affected by fluctuations in natural gas, gasoline and diesel prices. In order to attract fleet operators and other consumers to convert to natural gas vehicles, we must be able to offer CNG and LNG fuel at prices significantly lower than gasoline and diesel. Decreases in the price of gasoline and diesel and increases in the price of natural gas make it more difficult for us to offer our customers attractive prices for CNG and LNG as compared to gasoline and diesel prices and maintain an acceptable margin on our sales. Further, increased natural gas prices affect the cost to us of natural gas and adversely impact our operating margins in cases where we cannot pass the increased costs through to our customers, and conversely, lower natural gas prices reduce our revenues in cases where the commodity cost is passed through to our customers.\nAmong the factors that can cause fluctuations in gasoline, diesel and natural gas prices are changes in supply and availability of crude oil and natural gas, storage levels, level of consumer demand, price and availability of alternative fuels, weather conditions, negative publicity surrounding natural gas drilling techniques and methods or oil production and importing, economic conditions, the price of foreign imports, government regulations and political conditions. With respect to natural gas supply and use as a vehicle fuel, there have been recent efforts to place new regulatory requirements on the production of natural gas by hydraulic fracturing of shale gas reservoirs and other means and on transporting, dispensing and using natural gas. Hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling techniques have resulted in a substantial increase in the proven natural gas reserves in the United States and any changes in regulations that make it more expensive or unprofitable to produce natural gas through these techniques or others, as well as any changes to the regulations relating to transporting, dispensing or using natural gas, could lead to increased natural gas prices. Additionally, crude oil prices have recently been subject to extreme volatility and a significant decrease, due in part to over-production and increased supply without a corresponding increase in demand. If these conditions continue or worsen, or if all or some combination of factors causing further volatility in natural gas, oil and diesel prices were to occur, our business and our industry would be materially harmed.\nIf trucks using natural gas engines are not adopted by truck operators as quickly or to the extent we anticipate, our results of operations and business prospects will be adversely affected.\nWe believe the development and expansion of the U.S. natural gas heavy-duty truck market, and the execution of our America\u2019s Natural Gas Highway initiative to build a nationwide network of natural gas truck friendly fueling stations, depends upon the successful adoption of natural gas engines that are well-suited for use by heavy-duty trucks. We have no control over the marketing and sales efforts for these engines or the success of these efforts, the retail price for these engines or the number of these engines that are ultimately sold. Manufacturers may not produce natural gas engines in meaningful numbers or as quickly as we anticipate, which could contribute to continued or increased delay in adoption and deployment of natural gas trucks by operators. Other factors potentially contributing to slow or limited adoption of heavy-duty trucks powered by natural gas engines are that these trucks cost more than comparable gasoline or diesel trucks and may experience, or be perceived to experience, more operational or performance issues. Our business would be harmed if meaningful numbers of natural gas heavy-duty truck engines are not deployed, if such deployment is slower than expected, or if a substantial number of the trucks that are deployed experience performance issues with their natural gas engines or are not fueled at our stations.\nThe failure of our America\u2019s Natural Gas Highway initiative and our inability to achieve our goal to fuel a substantial number of natural gas heavy-duty trucks would materially and adversely affect our financial results and business.\nWe are seeking to fuel a substantial number of natural gas heavy-duty trucks and in connection with that effort we are building America\u2019s Natural Gas Highway. Our objectives to fuel a substantial number of heavy-duty trucks and build America\u2019s Natural Gas Highway have required, and will continue to require, a significant commitment of capital and other resources, and our ability to successfully execute our plans faces substantial risks, including, among others:\n\u2022\nMost of our ANGH stations were initially built to provide LNG, which costs more than CNG on an energy equivalent basis. We have been, and may continue to be required to, spend significant additional capital to add CNG fueling capability to many of our ANGH stations, and we may not have sufficient capital in the future for that purpose;\n\u2022\nOur ANGH stations may experience mechanical or operational difficulties, which could require significant costs to repair and could reduce customer confidence in our stations;\n\u2022\nTruck and vehicle operators may not fuel at our stations due to lack of access or convenience, prices or numerous other factors;\n\u2022\nWe have no influence over the development, production, cost or availability of natural gas trucks powered by engines that are well-suited for the U.S. heavy-duty truck market. At December 31, 2015, Cummins Westport was the principal natural gas engine manufacturer for the medium- and heavy-duty market, and we have no control over whether and the extent to which Cummins Westport will remain in the natural gas engine business or whether other manufacturers will enter the natural gas engine business;\n\u2022\nOperators may not adopt heavy-duty natural gas trucks due to cost, actual or perceived performance issues, or other factors that are outside of our control. To date, adoption and deployment of natural gas trucks has been slower and more limited than we anticipated;\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to obtain acceptable margins on fuel sales at ANGH stations; and\n\u2022\nAt December 31, 2015, we had 43 completed ANGH stations that were not open for fueling operations. We expect to open such stations when we have sufficient customers to fuel at the locations, but we do not know when this will occur. If we do not open the stations, we will continue to have substantial investments in assets that do not produce revenues equal to or greater than their costs.\nWe must effectively manage these risks and any other risks that may arise in connection with the ANGH build-out to successfully execute our business plan. If the U.S. market for heavy-duty natural gas trucks does not develop or if we fail to successfully execute our ANGH initiative and fuel a substantial number of natural gas heavy-duty trucks, our financial results, operations and business, and our ability to repay our debt, will be materially and adversely affected.\nAutomobile and engine manufacturers produce very few natural gas vehicles and engines for the United States and Canadian markets, which limits our customer base and our sales of CNG, LNG and RNG.\nLimited availability of natural gas vehicles and engine sizes, including heavy-duty trucks and other types of vehicles, restricts their large-scale introduction and narrows our potential customer base. Limited production could also increase the cost to purchase natural gas vehicles. Original equipment manufacturers produce a relatively small number of natural gas engines and vehicles in the U.S. and Canadian markets and they may not decide to expand, or they may decide to discontinue or curtail, their existing natural gas engine or vehicle product lines. Additionally, engines that are produced may experience performance issues and be subject to recalls. A limited supply of natural gas vehicles limits our customer base and natural gas fuel sales and encourages existing manufacturers to charge a premium for such vehicles, thereby restricting our ability to promote natural gas vehicles.\nOur business is influenced by environmental, tax and other government regulations, programs and incentives that promote or encourage cleaner burning fuels and alternative vehicles and their adoption, modification or repeal could impact our business.\nOur business is influenced by federal, state and local government tax credits, rebates, grants and similar programs and incentives that promote the use of CNG, LNG and RNG as a vehicle fuel, as well as by laws, rules and regulations that require reductions in carbon emissions. Parties with an interest in gasoline and diesel or alternative fuels such as hydrogen- or electric-\npowered vehicles, many of which have substantially greater resources and influence than we have, invest significant time and money in efforts to delay, repeal or otherwise negatively influence regulations and programs that promote natural gas as a vehicle fuel. Any failure to adopt, delay in implementing, expiration, repeal or modification of federal, state or local regulations, programs or incentives that encourage the use of CNG, LNG and RNG as a vehicle fuel, or the adoption of any such regulations, programs or incentives that encourage the use of other alternative fuels or alternative vehicles instead of natural gas, would harm our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, changes to or the repeal of laws, rules and regulations that mandate reductions in carbon emissions and/or the use of renewable fuels, including the California and Oregon Low Carbon Fuel Standards and the federal Renewable Fuel Standard, under which we generate LCFS Credits and RIN Credits, respectively, by selling CNG, LNG and RNG as a vehicle fuel, would adversely affect our financial condition. For example, CARB recently adopted changes to its carbon intensity number for CNG, LNG and RNG to take into account alleged system-wide methane losses, which changes resulted in fewer carbon benefits associated with the use of natural gas as a vehicle fuel, and this may adversely affect our business. Further, our business would be adversely affected if grant funds cease to be available under government programs for the purchase and construction of natural gas vehicles and stations.\nWe face increasing competition from a variety of organizations, many of which have far greater resources and brand awareness than we have.\nA significant number of established businesses, including oil and gas companies, alternative vehicle and alternative fuel companies, refuse collectors, natural gas utilities and their affiliates, industrial gas companies, truck stop and fuel station owners, fuel providers and other organizations have entered or are planning to enter the market for natural gas and other alternatives for use as vehicle fuels. Additionally, for certain of our key customer markets, such as airports and public transit, we indirectly compete with companies such as Uber and Lyft that provide alternative transportation methods that may limit these markets generally. Further, we compete with producers and sellers of gasoline and diesel fuels, which power the vast majority of vehicles in the U.S. and Canada, suppliers of other alternative vehicle fuels and providers of hybrid and electric vehicles. Many of these current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, research and other resources than we have. New technologies and improvements to existing technologies may make alternatives other than natural gas more attractive to the market, or may slow the development of the market for natural gas as a vehicle fuel if such advances are made with respect to oil and gas usage. Natural gas utilities and their affiliates also own and operate natural gas fueling stations that compete with our stations. For example, the California Public Utilities Commission has approved a compression services tariff application by the Southern California Gas Company, allowing the utility to compete with us by building and owning natural gas compression equipment on customer property and by providing operation and maintenance services to customers. Additionally, Northwest National has been granted a similar service tariff by the Oregon Public Utilities Commission. Utilities or their affiliates in several other states, including Michigan, Illinois, New Jersey, North Carolina, Maryland, Washington, Kentucky, Florida and Georgia, either have entered or are preparing to enter the natural gas vehicle fuel business. Utilities and their affiliates typically have unique competitive advantages, including lower cost of capital, substantial and predictable cash flows, long-standing customer relationships, greater brand awareness and large and well-trained sales and marketing organizations.\nWe expect competition to increase in the alternative vehicle fuels market generally and, if the use of natural gas vehicles and the demand for natural gas vehicle fuel increases, the market for natural gas vehicle fuel. Any such increased competition would lead to amplified pricing pressure, reduced operating margins and fewer expansion opportunities.\nIf there are advances in other alternative vehicle fuels or technologies, or if there are improvements in gasoline, diesel or hybrid engines, demand for natural gas vehicles may decline.\nTechnological advances in the production, delivery and use of alternative fuels that are, or are perceived to be, cleaner, more cost-effective or more readily available than CNG, LNG or RNG have the potential to slow or limit adoption of natural gas vehicles. Advances in gasoline and diesel engine technology, including efficiency improvements and further development of hybrid engines, may also offer a cleaner, more cost-effective option and make fleet customers less likely to convert their vehicles to natural gas. Technological advances related to ethanol or biodiesel, which are used as an additive to, or substitute for, gasoline and diesel fuel, may slow the need to diversify fuels and affect the growth of the natural gas vehicle fuel market. Use of electric heavy-duty trucks, buses and trash trucks, or the perception that such vehicles may soon be widely available and provide satisfactory performance, may reduce demand for natural gas vehicles. In addition, hydrogen and other alternative fuels in experimental or developmental stages may prove to be cleaner, more cost-effective alternatives to gasoline and diesel than natural gas. Advances in technology that slow or curtail the growth of natural gas vehicle purchases or conversions, or that otherwise reduce demand for natural gas as a vehicle fuel will have an adverse effect on our business. Failure of natural gas vehicle technology to advance at a sufficient pace may also limit its adoption and our ability to compete with gasoline-and diesel-powered vehicles and other alternative fuels and alternative vehicles.\nWe are subject to risks associated with station construction and similar activities, including difficulties identifying suitable station locations, zoning and permitting issues, local resistance, cost overruns, delays and other contingencies.\nIn connection with our station construction operations, we may not be able to identify, obtain and retain sufficient permits, approvals and other rights to use suitable locations for the stations we or our customers seek to build. We may also encounter land use or zoning difficulties or local resistance that prohibit us or our customers from building new stations on preferred sites or limit or restrict the use of new or existing stations. Any such difficulties, resistance or limitations could harm our business and results of operations. In addition, we act as the general contractor and construction manager for station construction and facility modification projects and typically rely on licensed subcontractors to perform the construction work. We may be liable for any damage we or our subcontractors cause, or for injuries suffered by our employees or our subcontractors\u2019 employees, during the course of our projects. Shortages of skilled subcontractor labor for our projects could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase our costs. Our profit on our projects is based in part on assumptions about the cost of the projects and cost overruns, delays or other execution issues may, in the case of projects that we complete and sell to customers, result in our failure to achieve our expected margins or cover our costs, and in the case of projects that we build and own, result in our failure to achieve an acceptable rate of return.\nOur manufacturing operations could subject us to significant costs and other risks, including product liability claims.\nClean Energy Compression designs, manufactures, sells and services non-lubricated natural gas fueling compressors and related equipment used in CNG stations. The equipment Clean Energy Compression produces and sells has not in some instances performed, and may not in the future perform, as expected, according to legal, contractual or other specifications or at all. Clean Energy Compression has in the past and may in the future incur significant and unexpected costs in the life cycle of its products, including costs incurred to fix any discovered performance errors and to repair any product malfunctions. The scope and likelihood of these risks continues to increase as Clean Energy Compression makes efforts to expand its services to new geographic and other markets. The occurrence of any of these risks has and may continue to reduce sales of Clean Energy Compression products and services, damage our customer relationships and reputation, delay the launch of new Clean Energy Compression products and services, force product recalls and/or result in product liability claims.\nOur warranty reserves may not adequately cover our warranty obligations.\nWe provide product warranties with varying terms and durations for natural gas compressors and stations we build and sell to customers, and we establish reserves for the estimated liability associated with our product warranties. Our warranty reserves are based on historical trends as well as our understanding of specifically identified warranty issues and the amounts estimated for these reserves could differ materially from warranty costs that may ultimately be realized. We would be adversely affected by an increase in the rate of warranty claims or the average amount involved with each warranty claim or the occurrence of unexpected warranty claims.\nIncreased global IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions and services.\nIncreased global IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data and operational disruptions.\nThe global scope of our operations exposes us to additional risks and uncertainties.\nClean Energy Compression has operations in a number of countries, including Canada, China, Colombia, Bangladesh and Peru. Clean Energy Compression\u2019s natural gas compression equipment is primarily manufactured in Canada and sold globally, which exposes us to a number of risks that can arise from international trade transactions, local business practices and cultural considerations. In addition to the other risks described in these risk factors, the global scope of our operations may subject us to risks and uncertainties that could limit our operations, increase our costs or otherwise negatively impact our business and financial condition, including, among others:\n\u2022\nFailure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable anti-bribery laws;\n\u2022\nPolitical unrest, terrorism, war, natural disasters and economic and financial instability;\n\u2022\nCheap local oil, gasoline or diesel;\n\u2022\nChanges in environmental and other regulatory requirements and uncertainty related to developing legal and regulatory systems and standards for economic and business activities, real property ownership and application of contract rights;\n\u2022\nTrade restrictions and import-export regulations;\n\u2022\nDifficulties enforcing agreements and collecting receivables;\n\u2022\nDifficulties complying with the laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nDifficulties ensuring that health, safety, environmental and other working conditions are properly implemented and/or maintained by local offices;\n\u2022\nDiffering employment practices and/or labor issues, including wage inflation, labor unrest and unionization policies;\n\u2022\nLimited intellectual property protection;\n\u2022\nLonger payment cycles by international customers;\n\u2022\nInadequate local infrastructure and disruptions of service from utilities or telecommunications providers, including electricity shortages; and\n\u2022\nPotentially adverse tax consequences.\nIn addition to the above, we also face risks associated with currency exchange and convertibility, inflation and repatriation of earnings as a result of our foreign operations. In some countries, economic, monetary and regulatory factors could affect our ability to convert funds to United States dollars or move funds from accounts in these countries. We are also vulnerable to appreciation or depreciation of foreign currencies against the United States dollar, which could negatively impact our operating results and financial performance.\nWe depend on key people to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain our key people or hire additional qualified people, our ability to develop and successfully market our business would be harmed.\nWe believe that our future success is highly dependent on the contributions of our executive officers, as well as our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial, sales, technical and finance personnel. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. All of our executive officers and other United States employees may terminate their employment relationships with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. If we are unable to retain our executive officers and key employees or, if such individuals leave our Company, we are unable to attract and successfully integrate quality replacements, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe have significant contracts with government entities that are subject to unique risks.\nWe have, and will continue to seek, long-term CNG, LNG and RNG station construction, maintenance and fuel sales contracts with various government bodies, which accounted for approximately 19%, 18% and 18% of our annual revenues in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. In addition to normal business risks, our contracts with government entities are often subject to unique risks, some of which are beyond our control. Long-term government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation if adequate appropriations for subsequent performance periods are not made. The termination of funding for a government program supporting any of our government contracts could result in a loss of anticipated future revenues attributable to that contract, which could have a negative impact on our operations. In addition, government entities with which we contract are often able to modify, curtail or terminate contracts with us without prior notice at their convenience, and are only required to pay for work done and commitments made at the time of termination. Modification, curtailment or termination of significant government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Further, government contracts are frequently awarded only after competitive bidding processes, which are often protracted. In many cases, unsuccessful bidders for government contracts are provided the opportunity to formally protest certain contract awards through various agencies or other administrative and judicial channels. The protest process may substantially delay a successful bidder\u2019s contract performance, result in cancellation of the contract award entirely and distract management. As a result, we may not be awarded contracts for which we bid and substantial delays or cancellation of contracts may follow any successful bids as a result of such protests.\nNatural gas purchase commitments may exceed demand, causing our costs to increase.\nWe are a party to two long-term natural gas purchase agreements that have a take-or-pay commitment, and we may enter into additional contracts with take-or-pay commitments in the future. Take-or-pay commitments require us to pay for the natural gas that we have agreed to purchase irrespective of whether we can sell the gas. Should the market demand for natural gas as a vehicle fuel decline or fail to develop as we anticipate, if we lose significant natural gas vehicle fueling customers, or if demand under any existing or any future sales contract does not maintain its volume levels or grow, these commitments may cause our operating and supply costs to increase without a corresponding increase in revenue and our margins may be negatively impacted.\nCompliance with greenhouse gas emissions regulations affecting our LNG plants, RNG production facilities, LNG and CNG fueling stations or CNG, LNG and RNG fuel sales may prove costly and negatively affect our financial performance.\nCalifornia has adopted legislation, AB 32, that calls for a cap on greenhouse gas emissions throughout California and a statewide reduction to 1990 levels by 2020 and an additional 80% reduction below 1990 levels by 2050. Further, in 2015 the Governor of California issued an executive order mandating a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 40% compared to 1990 levels by 2030. As of January 1, 2015, AB 32 began regulating the greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels, including the emissions associated with LNG and CNG vehicle fuel.\nUnder AB 32, the LNG vehicle fuel provider is the regulated party with respect to LNG vehicle fuel use. We estimate that we will be required to pay at least $150,000 in 2016 to comply with AB 32 with respect to our LNG vehicle fuel sales in California. Our costs in future years will depend on how much LNG vehicle fuel we sell that is regulated, CARB's guidance on the regulation of LNG vehicle fuel, potential regulatory changes and the cost of carbon credits under AB 32 at the time we purchase them. We anticipate that the costs we incur to comply with this legislation will be passed through to our LNG vehicle fuel purchasers, which may diminish the attractiveness of LNG as a vehicle fuel for California buyers. With respect to CNG, the regulated party under AB 32 is the utility that owns the pipe through which the fossil fuel natural gas is sold. SoCalGas, the Southern California gas utility, has recently announced that it intends to charge CNG fueling customers an additional $0.27 per MMBtu beginning in April 2016 to cover its AB 32 compliance costs on each MMBtu of CNG sold. We anticipate that we will pass these additional utility fees on to our customers, which will diminish the economic attractiveness of CNG vehicle fuel. In addition, we anticipate that, over time, as the utilities compliance costs increase, we or our CNG customers will be required to pay more for CNG vehicle fuel to cover the increased AB 32 compliance costs of the utility. These costs will be determined by the amount the utility spends to buy any carbon credits needed to comply with AB 32 as a result of the natural gas we or our customers buy through the utility\u2019s pipeline. Although our Redeem\u2122 RNG vehicle fuel may qualify for an exemption from AB 32 when sold as LNG or CNG, the complexity of the requirements that biomethane must meet in order to be exempt under AB 32 and the possibility of changes to this legislation make any exemption uncertain. Any Redeem\u2122 volumes that are not exempt would incur compliance costs commensurate with sales of CNG and LNG derived from fossil fuel natural gas.\nThe federal government and other state governments are considering passing similar measures to regulate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Any of these regulations, when and if implemented, may regulate the greenhouse gas emissions produced by our LNG production plants, our CNG and LNG fueling stations or our RNG production facilities, and/or the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the CNG, LNG and RNG we sell, and could require us to obtain emissions credits or invest in costly emissions prevention technology. We cannot currently estimate the potential costs associated with compliance with potential federal, state or local regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and these unknown costs are not contemplated by our current customer agreements. If any of these regulations are implemented, our associated compliance costs may have a negative impact on our financial performance, reduce our margins and impair our ability to fulfill customer contracts. Further, these regulations may discourage consumers from adopting natural gas as a vehicle fuel.\nOur operations entail inherent safety and environmental risks that may result in substantial liability to us.\nOur operations entail inherent risks, including equipment defects, malfunctions, failures, and misuses, which could result in uncontrollable flows of natural gas, fires, explosions and other damage. For example, operation of LNG pumps requires special training because of the extremely low temperatures of LNG. Also, LNG tanker trailers have in the past been, and may in the future be, involved in accidents that result in explosions, fires and other damage. Further, improper refueling of natural gas vehicles can result in venting of methane gas, which is a potent greenhouse gas, and such methane emissions are currently regulated by some state regulatory agencies and may in the future be regulated by the EPA and/or by additional state regulators . Additionally, CNG fuel tanks and trailers, if damaged by accidents or improper maintenance or installation, may rupture and the contents of the tank or trailer may rapidly decompress and result in death or serious injury. These risks may expose us to liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, pollution and other environmental damage. We may incur substantial liability and cost if damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits.\nWe provide financing to fleet customers for natural gas vehicles, which exposes our business to credit risks.\nWe lend to certain qualifying customers a portion and occasionally up to 100% of the purchase price of natural gas vehicles they agree to purchase. We may also purchase or pay deposits for vehicles and lease to or otherwise place them with customers. Risks associated with these financing activities include, among others, that: the equipment financed consists mostly of vehicles that are mobile and easily damaged, lost or stolen; and the borrower may default on payments, enter bankruptcy proceedings and/or liquidate. As of December 31, 2015, we had $12.8 million outstanding in loans provided to customers to finance natural gas vehicle purchases.\nOur business is subject to a variety of government regulations that may restrict our operations and result in costs and penalties.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to foreign business practices, the environment, health and safety, labor and employment, building codes and construction, zoning and land use and taxation, among others. Additionally, we are subject to changing and complex regulations related to the government procurement process and any political activities or lobbying relating to natural gas or greenhouse gas emissions regulations in which we may engage. It is difficult and costly to manage the requirements of every individual authority having jurisdiction over our various activities and to comply with these varying standards. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and in many cases have tended to become more stringent over time. Any changes to existing regulations or adoption of new regulations may result in significant additional expense to us and our customers. Further, from time to time, as part of the regular evaluation of our operations, including newly acquired or developing operations, we may be subject to compliance audits by regulatory authorities, which may involve significant costs and use of other resources. Also, in connection with our operations, we often need facility permits or licenses to address, among other things, storm water or wastewater discharges, waste handling and air emissions, which may subject us to onerous or costly permitting conditions.\nOur failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations may result in a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of corrective requirements, or prohibition from providing services to government entities.\nOur RNG business may not be successful.\nWe own RNG production facilities located in Canton, Michigan and North Shelby, Tennessee. We are also seeking to increase our RNG business by pursuing additional projects on our own and with project partners. We may not be successful in operating or developing these projects or any future projects or generating a financial return from our investments. Historically, projects that produce pipeline-quality RNG have often failed due to the volatile prices of conventional natural gas, unpredictable RNG production levels, technological difficulties and costs associated with operating the production facilities, and the lack of government programs and regulations that support these activities. The success of our RNG business depends on our ability to obtain necessary financing, to successfully manage the construction and operation of our RNG production facilities, to enter into RNG supply agreements with third parties, and to either sell RNG at substantial premiums to conventional natural gas prices or to sell, at favorable prices, credits we may generate under federal or state laws, rules and regulations, including RINs and LCFS Credits. If we are not successful at one or more of these activities, our RNG business could fail.\nThe market for RINs and LCFS Credits is volatile, and the prices for such credits are subject to significant fluctuations. Further, the value of RINs and LCFS Credits will be adversely affected by any changes to federal and state programs under which such credits are generated and sold. In the absence of federal and state programs that support premium prices for RNG or that allow us to generate and sell LCFS Credits and RINs or other credits, or if our customers are not otherwise willing to pay a premium for RNG, we may be unable to profitably operate our RNG business.\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, difficulties producing RNG.\nWe have experienced difficulties producing the expected volumes of RNG at our RNG plants due to, among other factors, problems with key equipment, severe weather, landfill conditions and construction delays. These difficulties may continue or worsen in the future. Additionally, our ability to produce RNG may be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including, among others, limited availability or unfavorable composition of collected landfill gas, failure to obtain and renew necessary permits and landfill mismanagement. In addition, we may seek to or be required to upgrade, expand or service our RNG facilities, which may result in plant shutdowns, cause delays that reduce the amount of RNG we produce or involve significant unexpected costs.\nWe may from time to time pursue acquisitions, investments or other strategic relationships, which could fail to meet expectations.\nWe may acquire or invest in other companies or businesses or pursue other strategic transactions or relationships. Acquisitions, investments and other strategic partnerships and relationships involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including, among others:\n\u2022\nDifficulties integrating the technologies, operations, existing contracts and personnel of an acquired company or partner;\n\u2022\nDifficulties supporting and transitioning vendors, if any, of an acquired company or partner;\n\u2022\nDiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition or investment opportunities;\n\u2022\nFailure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction or relationship;\n\u2022\nFailure to identify all of the problems, liabilities, shortcomings or challenges of a company or technology we may partner with, invest in or acquire, including issues related to intellectual property rights, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or customer relationships;\n\u2022\nRisks of entering new markets in which we may have limited or no experience;\n\u2022\nPotential loss of key employees, customers and vendors from an acquired company\u2019s or partner\u2019s business;\n\u2022\nInability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition, investment or other related costs;\n\u2022\nAdditional costs or incurrence of debt or equity dilution associated with funding the acquisition, investment or other relationship; and\n\u2022\nPossible write-offs or impairment charges relating to the businesses we partner with, invest in or acquire.\nOur quarterly results of operations fluctuate significantly and are difficult to predict.\nOur quarterly results of operations, which are disclosed under \u201cQuarterly Results of Operations\u201d in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report, have historically experienced significant fluctuations. Our quarterly results of operations may continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including those described in these risk factors. If our quarterly results of operations fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. As a result of the significant fluctuations of our operating results in prior periods, period- to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and investors in our common stock should not rely on the results of any one quarter as an indicator of future performance.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nSales of shares could cause the market price of our stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nAs of December 31, 2015, there were 92,382,717 shares of our common stock outstanding, 11,487,938 shares underlying outstanding options, 3,419,776 shares underlying restricted stock units, 3,130,682 shares underlying outstanding warrants and 35,185,979 shares underlying outstanding convertible notes. All of our outstanding shares are eligible for sale in the public market, subject in certain cases to the requirements of Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Also, shares issued upon exercise or conversion of outstanding options, warrants and convertible notes are eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of the applicable option, warrant and convertible note agreements and Rule 144, or if such shares have been registered for resale under the Securities Act. If these shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nAs of December 31, 2015, 17,441,860 shares of our common stock held by our co-founder and board member T. Boone Pickens were pledged as security for loans made to Mr. Pickens. We are not a party to these loans. If the price of our common stock declines, Mr. Pickens may be forced to provide additional collateral for the loans or to sell shares of our common stock in order to remain within the margin limitations imposed under the terms of the loans. Any sales of our common stock following a margin call that is not satisfied or any other large sales of our common stock by our officers and directors, such as Mr. Pickens' sale of approximately 700,000 shares in September 2015, may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nA significant portion of our stock is beneficially owned by a single stockholder whose interests may differ from yours and who is able to exert significant influence over our corporate decisions, including a change of control.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our co-founder and board member T. Boone Pickens beneficially owned approximately 22.9% of our common stock (including 17,441,860 outstanding shares of common stock, 725,000 shares underlying stock options exercisable within 60 days after December 31, 2015, and 4,113,923 shares underlying convertible promissory notes convertible within 60 days after December 31, 2015). As a result, Mr. Pickens is able to strongly influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions. Mr. Pickens may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and that may be adverse to your interests. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our Company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their stock as part of a sale of our Company, and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock. Conversely, this concentration may facilitate a change of control at a time when you and other investors may prefer not to sell.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant volatility. Such volatility may be in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the other factors discussed in these risk factors, factors that may cause volatility in our stock price include, among others:\n\u2022\nSuccessful implementation of our business plans;\n\u2022\nInvestor perception of our industry or our prospects;\n\u2022\nA decline in the trading volume of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nChanges in general economic and market conditions.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies, and in such instances, have affected the market prices of these companies\u2019 securities. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 92035, "SIC": 5500, "TIC": "CLNE"}
