RISK FACTORS\nThe following important risk factors, and those risk factors described elsewhere in this report or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in forward-looking statements contained in this document and elsewhere. These risks are not presented in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Further, the risks described below are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, profitability, cash flows or liquidity.\nRisks relating to the COVID-19 pandemic\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and related efforts to mitigate its spread have had an adverse impact on our results of operation and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe global pandemic resulting from the coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) has resulted in a decrease in travel and has materially impacted airline traffic and operations throughout the world, our operations and the operations of our lessees and aircraft manufacturers and suppliers, including reducing the manufacturing output at Boeing and Airbus\u2019 final assembly facilities. Part of the decreased demand in travel has been caused by governmental authorities around the world implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, border closures, quarantines, shelter in place or total lock-down orders and business limitations and shutdowns. These measures may remain in place for a significant amount of time.\nWhile we cannot currently reasonably estimate the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will ultimately impact our business, the pandemic has already impacted our financial results and operations and its impact on our business and financial results may worsen over the next several months as a result of the resurgence of COVID-19 globally and related actions to combat the virus. We have negotiated lease deferrals and other accommodations with our customers. As of February 22, 2021, we have agreed to accommodations with approximately 61% of our lessees. The majority of these accommodations have been in the form of partial lease deferrals. As of February 22, 2021, our total deferrals, net of repayments, was $144.3 million. To date, we have agreed to defer approximately $240.4 million in lease payments, of which $96.1 million or 40% of the total deferrals have been repaid. These lease deferrals have negatively impacted our cash flow provided by operating activities. While the majority of the accommodations are in the form of lease deferrals, we have also entered into some lease restructurings, which typically included lease extensions, resulting in a decrease of approximately $49.2 million in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. We remain in active discussions with our airline customers and may continue to provide accommodations on a case-by-case basis. Our aircraft sales program has been impacted by the pandemic, primarily because we elected to sell fewer aircraft in 2020 because of additional delivery delays of our new orderbook aircraft from Boeing and Airbus. We had no aircraft sales during the fourth quarter of 2020. During 2020, we experienced delays in some of our planned sales and we may face delays in completing any aircraft sales in 2021.\nIn addition to lease deferrals and other lease concessions, we may also experience financial losses from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic due to a number of other factors, including:\n\u25cf delays in our ability to remarket aircraft or otherwise re-lease aircraft on a timely basis at favorable rates;\n\u25cf defaults, bankruptcies or reorganizations of our lessees;\n\u25cf defaults, bankruptcies or reorganizations of airlines adversely impacting aircraft values and lease rates generally;\n\u25cf further delays in delivery of aircraft in our orderbook from Boeing and Airbus, including due to delays or bankruptcies of Boeing and Airbus suppliers;\n\u25cf a decline in placements of aircraft in our orderbook for long-term leases;\n\u25cf aircraft value impairments;\n\u25cf increased costs of borrowing, including if our credit ratings are ultimately downgraded;\n\u25cf delays and other adverse impacts on our plans to grow the size of our operating fleet; and\n\u25cf weaker demand for used aircraft.\nThese factors may remain prevalent for a significant period of time, particularly if the resurgence of the COVID-19 virus continues or if the vaccines introduced to combat the virus are not effective. We expect our business, results of operations and financial condition will continue to be negatively impacted in the near term, and the pandemic could have a larger impact on our results of operations in 2021. Furthermore, the impact of the pandemic may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided.\nRisks relating to our capital requirements and debt financings\nWe have substantial indebtedness and we require significant capital to refinance our outstanding indebtedness and to acquire aircraft; our inability to make our debt payments and obtain incremental capital may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe and our subsidiaries have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, our total consolidated indebtedness, net of discounts and issuance costs, was approximately $16.5 billion and our interest payments were $449.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and we expect these amounts to grow as we acquire more aircraft. Our level of debt could have important consequences, including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt payment obligations and requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing; increasing our vulnerability to negative economic and industry conditions; increasing our interest rate risk; and limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our industry.\nGrowing our fleet will require us to obtain substantial capital through additional financing, which may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all. As of December 31, 2020, we had 361 new aircraft on order with an estimated aggregate purchase price of approximately $23.9 billion. In addition to utilizing cash flow from operations to meet these commitments and to maintain an adequate level of unrestricted cash, we will need to raise additional funds by accessing committed debt facilities, securing additional financing from banks and through capital markets transactions. We also need to maintain access to the capital and credit markets and other sources of financing in order to repay or refinance our outstanding debt obligations.\nOur access to financing sources depends upon a number of factors over which we have limited control, including general market conditions and interest rate fluctuations; periods of unexpected market disruption and volatility; the market's view of the quality of our assets, perception of our growth potential and assessment of our credit risk; the relative attractiveness of alternative investments; and the trading prices of our debt securities and preferred and common equity securities. Depending on market conditions at the time and our access to capital, we may also have to rely more heavily on additional equity issuances or on less efficient forms of debt financing that require a larger portion of our cash flow from operations, thereby reducing funds available for our operations, future business opportunities and other purposes. Further, the issuance of additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock or any other preferred stock approved by our board of directors pursuant to our charter may result in such preferred stockholders having rights, preferences or privileges senior to existing stockholders, who would not have the ability to approve such issuance. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to make payments on our debt or to meet our aircraft purchase commitments as they come due and other cash needs. The issuance of additional equity may be dilutive to existing shareholders or otherwise may be on terms not favorable to us or existing shareholders.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and cannot obtain capital on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to seek alternatives, such as to reduce or delay investments and aircraft purchases, or to sell aircraft. We also may not be able to satisfy funding requirements for any aircraft acquisition commitments then in place, which could force us to forfeit our deposits and/or expose us to potential breach of contract claims by our lessees and manufacturers.\nAs a result of these risks and repercussions, our inability to make our debt payments and/or obtain incremental capital to fund future aircraft purchases may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAn increase in our cost of borrowing or changes in interest rates may adversely affect our net income and/or our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nWe finance our business through a combination of short-term and long-term debt financings, with most bearing interest at a fixed rate and some bearing interest at a floating rate that varies with changes in the applicable reference rate. As of December 31, 2020, we had $15.5 billion of fixed rate debt and $1.2 billion of floating rate debt outstanding. Any increase in our cost of borrowing directly impacts our net income. If our composite interest rate were to increase by 1.0%, we would expect to incur additional interest expense on our existing indebtedness as of December 31, 2020, of approximately $11.7 million on an annualized basis. Our cost of borrowing is affected primarily by the market\u2019s assessment of our credit risk and fluctuations in interest rates and general market conditions. Interest rates that we obtain on our debt financings can fluctuate based on, among other things, changes in views of our credit risk, fluctuations in U.S. Treasury rates and LIBOR rates, as applicable, changes in credit spreads, and the duration of the debt being issued. Increased interest rates prevailing in the market at the time of our incurrence of new debt will also increase our interest expense.\nMoreover, if interest rates were to rise sharply, we would not be able to immediately offset the negative impact on our net income by increasing lease rates, even if the market were able to bear the increased lease rates. Our leases are generally for multiple years with fixed lease rates over the life of the lease and, therefore, lags will exist because our lease rates with respect to a particular aircraft cannot generally be increased until the expiration of the lease. Higher interest expense and the need to offset higher borrowing costs by increasing lease rates may ultimately impact our ability to compete with other aircraft leasing companies in the marketplace, especially if those companies have lower cost of funding.\nDecreases in interest rates may also adversely affect our business. Since our fixed rate leases are based, in part, on prevailing interest rates at the time we enter into the lease, if interest rates decrease, new fixed rate leases we enter into may be at lower lease rates and our lease revenue will be adversely affected.\nIn addition, certain of our debt instruments and equity securities that accrue dividends at a floating rate include the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as the benchmark or reference rate. The Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, has announced it intends to phase out certain LIBOR publications by the end of 2021 and all LIBOR publications after June 30, 2023. The U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have begun publishing a Secured Overnight Funding Rate and a reformed Sterling Overnight Index Average, respectively, which are intended to serve as alternative reference rates to LIBOR. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes, any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be implemented in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Uncertainty as to the nature or the timing and manner of implementation of such changes, alternative reference rates or other reforms may adversely affect our floating-rate indebtedness determined by reference to LIBOR and any of our equity securities that accrue dividends at a floating rate determined by reference to LIBOR. In addition, any alternative reference rates could result in interest and dividend payments that do not correlate over time with the payments that would have been made on our indebtedness or equity securities, as applicable, if LIBOR was available in its current form. Further, if there is no acceptable alternative reference rate when LIBOR is discontinued, some of our floating rate debt, including our senior unsecured notes issued under our Medium-Term Note Program, will effectively become fixed rate debt. As a result, the cost of this debt would increase to us if and as interest rates decreased.\nIf any of these circumstances occurs, our net income and/or our ability to compete in the marketplace may be adversely affected.\nNegative changes in our credit ratings may limit our ability to obtain financing or increase our borrowing costs, which may adversely impact our net income and/or our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nWe are currently subject to periodic review by independent credit rating agencies S&P, Fitch and Kroll, each of which currently maintains an investment grade rating with respect to us, and we may become subject to periodic review by other independent credit rating agencies in the future. Our ability to obtain debt financing and our cost of debt financing is dependent, in part, on our credit ratings. Maintaining our credit ratings depends in part on strong financial results and in part on other factors, including the outlook of the rating agencies on our sector and on the market generally. A credit rating downgrade could negatively impact our ability to obtain financing and increase our borrowing costs.\nAs a result of COVID-19, in March and April of 2020, S&P, Fitch and Kroll each changed their outlook on our long-term issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings from \u201cstable\u201d to \u201cnegative.\u201d Such change in outlook may ultimately lead to a downgrade in our credit rating.\nWe cannot assure you that these credit ratings will remain in effect or that a rating will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and each agency\u2019s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency\u2019s rating. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, could increase our borrowing costs and limit our access to the capital markets, which may adversely impact our net income and/or our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nCertain of our debt agreements contain covenants that impose restrictions on us and our subsidiaries that may limit our flexibility to operate our business.\nSome of the agreements governing our indebtedness contain financial and non-financial covenants. For instance, our unsecured revolving credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants (measured at the end of each fiscal quarter) including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, minimum consolidated shareholders\u2019 equity, and minimum consolidated unencumbered assets, as well as an interest coverage test that is suspended when the unsecured revolving credit facility or certain of our other indebtedness is rated investment grade (as defined in the unsecured revolving credit facility). Complying with such covenants may at times necessitate that we forego other opportunities. Moreover, our failure to comply with any of these covenants could constitute a default and could accelerate some, if not all, of the indebtedness outstanding under such agreements and could create cross-defaults under other debt agreements, which would have a negative effect on our business and our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, for our secured\ndebt, if we are unable to repay such indebtedness when due and payable, the lenders under our secured debt could proceed against, among other things, the aircraft or other assets securing such indebtedness.\nAs the result of the existence of these financial and non-financial covenants and our need to comply with them, the flexibility we have to operate our business may be limited.\nOperational risks relating to our business\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient returns on our aircraft investments which may have an adverse impact on our net income.\nOur business model and results are driven by our ability to acquire strategically attractive commercial passenger aircraft, profitably lease and re-lease them, and finally sell such aircraft in order to generate sufficient revenues to finance our growth and operations, pay our debt service obligations and meet our other corporate and contractual obligations. We rely on our ability to negotiate and enter into leases with favorable lease terms and to evaluate the ability of lessees to perform their obligations to us prior to receiving the delivery of our orderbook aircraft from the manufacturers. When our leases expire or our aircraft are returned prior to the date contemplated in the lease, we bear the risk of re-leasing or selling the aircraft. Because our leases are predominantly operating leases, only a portion of an aircraft\u2019s value is recovered by the revenues generated from the lease and we may not be able to realize the aircraft\u2019s residual value after lease expiration. Our ability to profitably purchase, lease, re-lease, sell or otherwise dispose of our aircraft will depend on conditions in the airline industry and general market and competitive conditions at the time of purchase, lease and disposition. In addition to factors linked to the aviation industry in general, other factors that may affect our ability to generate adequate returns from our aircraft include the maintenance and operating history of the airframe and engines, the number of operators using the particular type of aircraft, and aircraft age. If we are unable to generate sufficient returns on our aircraft due to any of the above factors within or outside of our control, it may have an adverse impact on our net income.\nFailure to close our aircraft acquisition commitments would negatively affect our ability to further grow our fleet and net income.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had entered into binding purchase commitments to acquire a total of 361 new aircraft for delivery through 2027. If we are unable to complete the purchase of such aircraft, we would face several risks, including forfeiting deposits and progress payments and having to pay and expense certain significant costs relating to these commitments; not realizing any of the benefits of completing the acquisitions; damage to our reputation and relationship with aircraft manufacturers; and defaulting on our lease commitments, which could result in monetary damages and damage to our reputation and relationships with lessees. If we determine that the capital required to satisfy these commitments is not available on terms we deem attractive, we may eliminate or reduce any then-existing dividend program to preserve capital to apply to such commitments. These risks, whether financial or reputational, would negatively affect our ability to further grow our fleet and net income.\nThe failure of an aircraft or engine manufacturer to meet its delivery obligations to us may negatively impact our ability to grow our fleet and our earnings.\nThe supply of commercial aircraft is dominated by a limited number of airframe and engine manufacturers. As a result, we depend on these manufacturers to remain financially stable, produce products and related components which meet the airlines' demands and fulfill any contractual obligations they have to us. If the manufacturers fail to do so, we may experience:\n\u25cf missed or late aircraft deliveries and potential inability to meet our contractual delivery obligations owed to our lessees, resulting in potential lost or delayed revenues, and strained customer relationships;\n\u25cf an inability to acquire aircraft and engines resulting in lower growth or contraction of our aircraft fleet;\n\u25cf reduced demand for a particular manufacturer's product, which may lead to reduced market lease rates and lower aircraft residual values and may affect our ability to remarket or sell at a profit, or at all, some of the aircraft in our fleet; and\n\u25cf technical or other difficulties with aircraft or engines after delivery that subject aircraft to operating restrictions or groundings, resulting in a decline in residual value and lease rates of such aircraft and impair our ability to lease or dispose of such aircraft on favorable terms or at all.\nThere have been recent well-publicized delivery delays by airframe and engine manufacturers. We have experienced delivery delays for Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX as a result of its grounding and subsequent manufacturing shutdown, and while production of 737 MAXs resumed in the fall of 2020, delivery of the aircraft into markets yet to approve the aircraft\u2019s return to service will likely remain on hold. We also experienced delivery delays for our Airbus A320neo family aircraft and to a lesser extent, A330neo aircraft. Further, during the fourth quarter of 2020, deliveries of our Boeing 787 aircraft have been temporarily delayed as a product of expanded quality-control\nchecks by the manufacturer. We had 140 and 106 A320neo family and 737 MAX aircraft, respectively, in our orderbook as of December 31, 2020. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in delivery delays for aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2020 and we anticipate additional delivery delays throughout 2021. Our leases and purchase agreements with Boeing and Airbus typically provide for cancellation rights starting at one year after the original contractual delivery date, regardless of cause. If there are delivery delays greater than one year for aircraft that we have made future lease commitments, some or all of our affected lessees could elect to cancel their lease with respect to such delayed aircraft. Any such cancellation could strain our relationship with such lessee going forward and would negatively affect our business. As of February 22, 2021, we have canceled our orders for 20 737 MAX aircraft with Boeing. We believe that the majority of our 737 MAX aircraft and some of our 787 aircraft deliveries in our orderbook will be delayed more than 12 months, which would give us, our airline customers and Boeing the right to cancel these aircraft commitments.\nShould the severity of the delivery delays from the manufacturers continue or worsen, or should new delays arise, such delays may negatively impact our ability to grow our fleet and our earnings.\nIf our aircraft become obsolete or experience a decline in customer demand, our ability to lease and remarket those aircraft and our results of operations may be negatively impacted and may result in impairment charges.\nAircraft are long-lived assets, requiring long lead times to develop and manufacture, with models becoming obsolete or less in demand over time, in particular when newer, more advanced aircraft are manufactured.\nOur fleet, as well as the aircraft that we have ordered, have exposure to a decline in customer demand or obsolescence, particularly if unanticipated events occur which shorten the life cycle of such aircraft types, including: the introduction of superior aircraft or technology, such as new airframes or engines with higher fuel efficiency; the entrance of a new manufacturer which could offer an aircraft that is more attractive to our target lessees; the advent of alternative transportation technologies which could make travel by air less desirable; government regulations, including those limiting noise and emissions and the age of aircraft operating in a jurisdiction; the costs of operating an aircraft, including maintenance which increases with aircraft age; and compliance with airworthiness directives. Obsolescence of certain aircraft may also trigger impairment charges, increase depreciation expense or result in losses related to aircraft asset value guarantees, if we provide such guarantees.\nThe demand for our aircraft is also affected by other factors outside of our control, including: air passenger demand; airline financial health; changes in fuel costs, interest rates, foreign currency, inflation and general economic conditions; technical problems associated with a particular aircraft model; airport and air traffic control infrastructure constraints; and the availability and cost of financing.\nAs a result of various impacts of COVID-19 including border restrictions and other travel limitations particularly on long-haul intercontinental travel, we have seen further reduced demand for certain widebody aircraft in our fleet. Due to the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX and other narrow body delivery delays, our fleet currently has a greater concentration of widebody aircraft than we typically target.\nAs demand for particular aircraft declines, lease rates for that type of aircraft are likely to correspondingly decline, the residual values of that type of aircraft could be negatively impacted, and we may be unable to lease such aircraft on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, the risks associated with a decline in demand for a particular aircraft model or type increase if we acquire a high concentration of such aircraft.\nIf demand declines for a model or type of aircraft of which we own or of which we have a relatively high concentration, or should the aircraft model or type become obsolete, our ability to lease and remarket those aircraft and our results of operations may be negatively impacted and may result in impairment charges.\nThe value and lease rates for aircraft that we own or acquire could decline resulting in an impact to our earnings and cash flows.\nFrom time to time, aircraft values and lease rates have experienced sharp decreases due to a variety of factors outside of our control that may impact the aviation industry generally or are more specific to certain aircraft in our fleet. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and Boeing 737 MAX grounding have each impacted, and may continue to impact, our ability to lease certain aircraft in our fleet. Other factors include, but are not limited to, the following: manufacturer production levels and technological innovation; the number of airlines operating the aircraft; our lessees\u2019 failure to maintain our aircraft; the regulatory authority under which the aircraft is operated and any applicable airworthiness directives, service bulletins or other regulatory action that could prevent or limit utilization of the aircraft. As a result of these factors, our earnings and cash flows may be impacted by any decrease in the value of aircraft that we own or acquire or decrease in market rates for leases for these aircraft.\nAircraft have limited economic useful lives and depreciate over time and we may be required to record an impairment charge or sell aircraft for a price less than its depreciated book value which may impact our financial results.\nWe depreciate our aircraft for accounting purposes on a straight-line basis to the aircraft\u2019s residual value over its estimated useful life. Our management team evaluates on a quarterly basis the need to perform an impairment test whenever facts or circumstances indicate a potential impairment has occurred. An assessment is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an aircraft may not be recoverable from their expected future undiscounted net cash flow. We develop the assumptions used in the recoverability assessment based on management's knowledge of, and historical experience in, the aircraft leasing market and aviation industry, as well as from information received from third-party industry sources. Factors considered in developing estimates for this assessment include changes in contracted lease rates, economic conditions, technology, and airline demand for a particular aircraft type. Any of our assumptions and estimates may prove to be inaccurate, which could adversely impact forecasted cash flow. In the event that an aircraft does not meet the recoverability test, the aircraft will be recorded at fair value, resulting in an impairment charge. Deterioration of future lease rates and the residual values of our aircraft could result in impairment charges which may have a significant impact on our financial results. For a description of our impairment policy, see the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies-Flight equipment.\u201d\nIf we record an impairment charge on aircraft, or if we dispose of aircraft for a price that is less than its depreciated book value on our balance sheet, it will reduce our total assets and shareholders' equity. A reduction in our shareholders' equity may negatively impact our ability to comply with covenants in certain of our agreements governing our indebtedness requiring us to maintain a minimum net worth and maximum debt-to-equity ratio, and could result in an event of default under such agreements. For these reasons, our financial results may be impacted.\nA large number of our lessees are concentrated in China and, therefore, we have concentrated exposure to political, legal and economic risks associated with China and any adverse event involving China may have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThrough our lessees and the countries in which they operate, we are exposed to the specific economic and political conditions and associated risks of those jurisdictions. Approximately 14% of our aircraft, based on net book value, are operated by lessees operated in China, giving us increased exposure to economic and political conditions in China, including trade disputes and trade barriers. Risks related to concentrated exposure can include economic recessions, financial, public health and political emergencies, burdensome local regulations, trade disputes, and increased risks of requisition of our aircraft. An adverse political or economic event in in China could affect the ability of our lessees in country to meet their obligations to us, or expose us to various legal or political risks associated, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe are dependent on the ability of our lessees to perform their payment and other obligations to us under our leases and their failure to do so may materially and adversely affect our financial results and cash flows.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from leases of aircraft to commercial airlines, with our lessees concentrated in certain geographical regions, and our financial performance is driven by the ability of our lessees to perform their payment and other obligations to us under our leases. The airline industry is also cyclical, economically sensitive and highly competitive, and our lessees are affected by several factors over which we and they have limited control, including: air passenger demand; changes in fuel costs, interest rates, foreign currency, inflation and general economic conditions; geopolitical events such as changes in national policy or imposition of trade barriers or tariffs, as well as events leading to political or economic instability such as war, prolonged armed conflict and acts of terrorism; epidemics and natural disasters; availability of financing, including availability of governmental support; airline financial health; labor difficulties, including pilot shortages or labor actions; increases in other operating costs, such as increased insurance costs; aircraft accidents, in particular a loss if the aircraft is damaged or destroyed by an event specifically excluded from insurance policies such as dirty bombs, biohazardous materials and electromagnetic pulsing; and governmental regulation and associated fees affecting the air transportation business.\nThe factors above could cause our lessees to incur higher costs and to generate lower revenues which could adversely affect their ability to make lease payments. In addition, lease default levels will likely increase over time if economic conditions deteriorate. Further, most of our airline customers do not have investment-grade credit profiles, and we may not correctly assess the credit risk of a lessee.\nIf a lessee delays, reduces, or fails to make lease payments when due, or has advised us that it will do so in the future, we may elect or be required to grant a lease payment deferral or restructure or terminate the lease. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the airline industry, including our lessees. A majority of our lessees have requested lease deferrals or other accommodations during the pandemic. If in the event we are unable to agree on a lease payment deferral or lease restructuring and we terminate the lease, we may not receive all or any payments still outstanding, and we may be unable to re-lease the aircraft promptly and at favorable rates, if at all. We have initiated/agreed to deferrals, restructurings and terminations in the ordinary course of our business, and\nwe expect more will occur in the future. If we perform a significant number of restructurings and terminations specifically, the associated reduction in lease revenue may materially and adversely affect our financial results and cash flows.\nLessee defaults and reorganizations, bankruptcies or similar proceedings, may result in loss revenues and additional costs.\nFrom time to time, an airline may seek reorganization or protection from creditors under its local laws or may go into liquidation. Some of our lessees have defaulted on their lease obligations or filed for bankruptcy or otherwise sought protection from creditors (collectively referred to as \u201cbankruptcy\u201d). Based on historical rates of airline defaults and bankruptcies, we expect that we will experience additional lessee defaults and bankruptcies and, depending on the length of the COVID-19 pandemic, lessee defaults and bankruptcies may increase in the near term.\nWhen a lessee defaults on its lease or files for bankruptcy, we typically incur significant additional costs, including legal and other expenses associated with court or other governmental proceedings. We could also incur substantial maintenance, refurbishment or repair costs if a defaulting lessee fails to pay such costs when necessary to put the aircraft in suitable condition for remarketing or sale. We may also incur storage costs associated with aircraft that we repossess and are unable to place immediately with another lessee, and we may not ultimately be able to re-lease the aircraft at a similar or favorable lease rate. It may also be necessary to pay off liens including fleet liens, taxes and other governmental charges on the aircraft to obtain clear possession and to remarket the aircraft effectively, including, in some cases, liens that the lessee might have incurred in connection with the operation of its other aircraft. We could also incur other costs in connection with the physical possession of the aircraft.\nWhen a lessee defaults on its lease or files for bankruptcy, the lessee may not make lease payments or may return aircraft to us before the lease expires. When a lessee files for bankruptcy with the intent of reorganizing its business, we may agree to adjust our lease terms, including reducing lease payments by a significant amount. Certain jurisdictions give rights to the trustee in a bankruptcy to assume or reject the lease or to assign it to a third party, or entitle the lessee or another third party to retain possession of the aircraft without paying lease rentals or performing all or some of the obligations under the relevant lease. If one or more airline bankruptcies result in a larger number of aircraft being available for purchase or lease over a short period of time, aircraft values and aircraft lease rates may be depressed, and additional grounded aircraft and lower market values could adversely affect our ability to sell our aircraft or lease or remarket our aircraft at favorable rates or at all.\nOur rights upon a lessee default will vary significantly depending upon the jurisdiction and the applicable law, including the need to obtain a court order for repossession of the aircraft and/or consents for deregistration or export of the aircraft. When a defaulting lessee is in bankruptcy additional limitations may apply. There can be no assurance that jurisdictions that have adopted the Cape Town Convention, which provides for uniformity and certainty for repossession of aircraft, will enforce it as written. In addition, certain of our lessees are owned, in whole or in part, by government-related entities, which could complicate our efforts to repossess our aircraft in that government\u2019s jurisdiction. Accordingly, we may be delayed in, or prevented from, enforcing certain of our rights under a lease and in remarketing the affected aircraft.\nIf we repossess an aircraft, we may not be able to export or deregister and profitably redeploy the aircraft in a timely manner or at all. Before an aviation authority will register an aircraft that has previously been registered in another country, it must receive confirmation that the aircraft has been deregistered by that country\u2019s aviation authority. In order to deregister an aircraft, the lessee must comply with applicable laws and regulations, and the relevant governmental authority must enforce these laws and regulations. For instance, where a lessee or other operator flies only domestic routes in the jurisdiction in which the aircraft is registered, repossession may be more difficult, especially if the jurisdiction permits the lessee or the other operator to resist deregistration. We may also incur significant costs in retrieving or recreating aircraft records required for registration of the aircraft, and in obtaining a certificate of airworthiness for an aircraft. Upon a lessee default, we may incur significant costs in connection with repossessing our aircraft and we may be delayed in repossessing our aircraft or are unable to obtain possession of our aircraft.\nAs a result of the time and process involved with lessee defaults, reorganizations, bankruptcies or similar proceedings as described above, which can vary by airline and jurisdiction among other factors, we may experience loss revenues and additional costs.\nWe may experience increased competition from other aircraft lessors which may impact our ability to execute our long-term strategy.\nThe aircraft leasing industry is highly competitive. Some of our competitors have greater resources, lower capital costs or provide financial or maintenance services, or other inducements to potential lessees or buyers that we cannot, which could make them able to compete more effectively in certain markets we operate in. In addition, some competitors may have higher risk tolerances, lower investment return expectations or different risk or residual value assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments, establish more relationships, bid more aggressively on aviation assets available for sale and offer lower lease rates or sale prices than we can. Our primary competitors are other aircraft leasing companies, but may include other entities in the acquisition, leasing and selling of aircraft. Additionally, the barriers to entry in the aircraft acquisition and leasing market are comparatively low, and new\nentrants with private equity, hedge fund, Asian bank or other funding sources appear from time to time.\nLease competition is driven by lease rates, delivery dates, lease terms, reputation, management expertise, aircraft condition, specifications and configuration and the availability of the types of aircraft necessary to meet the customer\u2019s needs. Competition in the used aircraft market is driven by price, the terms of the lease to which an aircraft is subject and the creditworthiness of the lessee, if any. Our inability to compete successfully with our competitors may impact our ability to execute our long-term strategy.\nOur lessees may fail to adequately insure our aircraft or fulfill their indemnity obligations which may result in increased costs and liabilities.\nWhen an aircraft is on lease, we do not directly control its operation. Nevertheless, because we hold title to the aircraft, we could be sued or held strictly liable for losses resulting from the operation of such aircraft, or may be held liable for those losses on other legal theories or claims may be made against us as the owner of an aircraft requiring us to expend resources in our defense. We require our lessees to obtain specified levels of insurance and indemnify us for, and insure against, liabilities arising out of the lessee\u2019s use and operation of the aircraft. Lessees are also required to maintain public liability, property damage and all risk hull and war risk insurance on the aircraft at agreed upon levels. Some lessees may fail to maintain adequate insurance coverage during a lease term, which, although in contravention of the lease terms, would necessitate our taking some corrective action such as terminating the lease or securing insurance for the aircraft. Moreover, even if our lessees retain specified levels of insurance, and indemnify us for, and insure against, liabilities arising out of their use and operation of the aircraft, we cannot assure you that we will not have any liability.\nIn addition, there are certain risks or liabilities that our lessees may face, for which insurers may be unwilling to provide coverage or the cost to obtain such coverage may be prohibitively expensive. For example, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, non-government aviation insurers significantly reduced the amount of insurance coverage available for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war, dirty bombs, bio-hazardous materials, electromagnetic pulsing or similar events. At the same time, they significantly increased the premiums for such third-party war risk and terrorism liability insurance and coverage in general. Accordingly, our lessees\u2019 insurance or other coverage could be insufficient to cover all claims that could be asserted against us arising from the operation of our aircraft by our lessees. Inadequate insurance coverage or default by lessees in fulfilling their indemnification or insurance obligations will reduce the proceeds that would be received by us if we are sued and are required to make payments to claimants. Moreover, our lessees\u2019 insurance coverage is dependent on the financial condition of insurance companies, which might not be able to pay claims.\nThe failure of our lessees to adequately insure our aircraft or fulfill their indemnity obligations to us, which could result in a reduction in insurance proceeds otherwise payable to us in certain cases, may result in increased costs and liabilities for our business.\nWe may experience the death, incapacity or departure of one of our key officers which may negatively impact our business.\nWe believe our senior management\u2019s reputation and relationships with lessees, manufacturers, buyers and financiers of aircraft are a critical element to the success of our business. We depend on the diligence, skill and network of business contacts of our management team. Our future success will depend, to a significant extent, upon the continued service of our senior management team, particularly: Mr. Udvar-H\u00e1zy, our founder, and Executive Chairman of the Board; Mr. Plueger, our Chief Executive Officer and President; and our other senior officers, each of whose services are critical to the success of our business strategies. We do not have employment agreements with Mr. Udvar-H\u00e1zy or Mr. Plueger. If we were to lose the services of any of the members of our senior management team, it may negatively impact our business.\nA cyberattack could lead to a material disruption of our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems or the IT systems of our third-party providers and the loss of business information, which may hinder our ability to conduct our business effectively and may result in lost revenues and additional costs.\nWe depend on our and our third-party provider\u2019s IT systems to conduct our operations. Such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, fire and natural disasters. Damage or interruption to such IT systems may require significant investment to fix or replace, and we may suffer operational interruptions. Potential interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce operational efficiency.\nParts of our business depend on the secure operation of our and our third-party providers\u2019 IT systems to manage, process, store, and transmit aircraft leasing information. We have, from time to time, experienced threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks. A cyberattack could adversely impact our daily operations and lead to the loss of sensitive information, including our proprietary information and that of our customers, suppliers and employees. Such losses could harm our reputation and result in competitive disadvantages, litigation, regulatory enforcement actions, lost revenues, additional costs and liabilities. While we devote substantial resources to maintaining adequate levels of cyber-security, our resources and technical sophistication may be unable to prevent\nall types of cyberattacks. A cyberattack leading to a significant disruption of our IT systems or of those of our third-party providers may hinder our ability to conduct our business effectively and may result in lost revenues and additional costs.\nConflicts of interest between us and clients utilizing our fleet management services could arise which may result in legal challenges or reputational harm.\nConflicts of interest may arise between us and third-party aircraft owners, financiers and operating lessors who hire us to perform fleet management services such as leasing, remarketing, lease management and sales services. These conflicts may arise because services we provide for these clients are also services which we provide for our own fleet, including placement of aircraft with lessees. Our current fleet management services agreements provide, and we expect our future fleet management services agreements to provide, that we will use our reasonable commercial efforts in providing services, but, to the extent that we are in competition with the client for leasing opportunities, we will give priority to our own fleet. Nevertheless, despite these contractual waivers, competing with our fleet management clients in practice may result in strained relationships with them. Any conflicts of interest that arise between us and the clients which utilize our fleet management services may result in legal challenges or reputational harm to our business.\nWe may encounter disputes, deadlock or other conflicts of interest with investment partners of entities in which we have minority interests and for which we serve as manager of the aircraft owned by the entities which may result in legal challenges, reputational harm or loss of fee income.\nWe own non-controlling interests in entities that invest in commercial aircraft and lease them to airlines around the world and/or facilitate the sale and continued management of aircraft assets to investors. Additionally, we may acquire interests in similar entities controlled or owned by third parties in order to take advantage of favorable financing opportunities or tax benefits, to share capital and/or operating risk, and/or to earn fleet management fees. Such interests involve significant risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership, including that:\n\u25cf we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment;\n\u25cf the investment may divert management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u25cf our investment partners could have investment goals that are not consistent with our investment objectives, including the timing, terms and strategies for any investments;\n\u25cf our investment partners might fail to fund their share of required capital contributions or fail to fulfill their other obligations; and\n\u25cf our investment partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues, particularly if aircraft owned by the applicable investment entity are being marketed for lease or sale at a time when we also have comparable aircraft available for lease or sale.\nThe agreements governing these entities typically provide the non-managing investment partner certain veto rights over various significant actions and the right to remove us as the manager under certain circumstances. If we were to be removed as the manager from a managed fleet portfolio, our reputation may be harmed and we would lose the benefit of future management fees. In addition, we might reach an impasse that could require us to dissolve the investment entity at a time and in a manner that could result in our losing some or all of our original investment in such entity, which may result in losses on our investment and potential legal challenges or reputational harm.\nMacroeconomic and global risks relating to our business\nAircraft oversupply in the industry could decrease the value and lease rates of the aircraft in our fleet resulting in an impact to our earnings and cash flows.\nThe aircraft leasing business has experienced periods of aircraft oversupply at various times in the past, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, during and after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and during and after the 2008 financial crisis. The oversupply of a specific type of aircraft is likely to depress the lease rates for, and the value of, that type of aircraft, including upon sale. Further, over recent years, the airline industry has committed to a significant number of aircraft deliveries through order placements with manufacturers, and in response, aircraft manufacturers have generally raised their production output. Increases in the production levels could result in an oversupply of relatively new aircraft if growth in airline traffic does not meet airline industry expectations. Additionally, if overall lending capacity to purchasers of aircraft does not increase in line with the increased aircraft production levels, the cost of lending or ability to obtain debt to finance aircraft purchases could be negatively affected. Oversupply may produce sharp and prolonged\ndecreases in market lease rates and residual values and may affect our ability to remarket or sell at a profit, or at all, some of the aircraft in our fleet which would impact our earnings and cash flows.\nIncreased tariffs and other potential export restrictions may impact where we can place and deliver our aircraft and negatively impact our ability to execute on our long-term strategy.\nOur leases are primarily structured as triple net leases, whereby the lessee is responsible for all operating costs including the costs associated with the importation of the aircraft. As a result, increased tariffs will result in a higher cost for imported aircraft that our lessees may not be willing to assume and which could adversely impact demand for aircraft, creating an oversupply of aircraft and potentially placing downward pressure on lease rates and aircraft market values.\nIn October 2019, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced a 10% tariff on new aircraft imported from Europe, including Airbus aircraft. In March 2020, the tariffs on aircraft were raised to 15%. The U.S. government has recently made statements and taken certain actions that have led to, and may lead to, further changes to U.S. and international trade policies, including recently imposed tariffs affecting certain products exported by a number of U.S. trading partners, such as Europe and China. In response, many U.S. trading partners, including Europe and China, have imposed or proposed new or higher tariffs on U.S. products. In November 2020, the E.U. announced a 15% tariff on new aircraft imported into the E.U. from the U.S., including Boeing aircraft, effective November 10, 2020.\nWe cannot predict what further actions may ultimately be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the U.S. and U.S. trading partners. Accordingly, it is difficult to predict exactly how, and to what extent, such actions may impact our business, or the business of our lessees or aircraft manufacturers. Any unfavorable government policies on international trade, such as capital controls or tariffs, may affect the demand for aircraft, increase the cost of aircraft components, further delay production, impact the competitive position of certain aircraft manufacturers or prevent aircraft manufacturers from being able to sell aircraft in certain countries. In turn, this may impact where we can place and deliver our aircraft which may negatively impact our ability to execute on our long-term strategy.\nWe are subject to many of the economic and political risks associated with doing business in emerging markets, which may expose our business to a greater number of customer defaults resulting in loss revenues and additional costs.\nOur business strategy involves leasing aircraft to airlines in emerging market countries. Emerging market countries typically have less developed economies and infrastructure and are often more vulnerable to economic and geopolitical challenges and may experience significant fluctuations in gross domestic product, interest rates and currency exchange rates, as well as civil disturbances, government instability, nationalization and expropriation of private assets and the imposition of unexpected taxes or other charges by government authorities. This can result in economic instability which could negatively affect the ability of our lessees to meet their lease obligations leading to higher default rates compared to lessees that operate in developed countries. We also may experience challenges in leasing or re-leasing aircraft in emerging markets experiencing economic instability. In addition, legal systems in emerging market countries may be less developed, less predictable and have different liability standards than those in advanced economies, which could make it more difficult for us to enforce our legal rights in such countries. As a result of these factors, doing business in emerging markets may expose us to a greater number of customer defaults resulting in loss revenues and additional costs.\nChanges in fuel costs could negatively affect our lessees and by extension the demand for our aircraft which may impact our ability to execute on our long-term strategy.\nHistorically, fuel prices have fluctuated widely depending primarily on international market conditions, geopolitical and environmental events, and currency exchange rates. The cost of fuel represents a major expense to airlines that is not within their control, and significant increases in fuel costs or hedges that inaccurately assess the direction of fuel costs can materially and adversely affect their operating results. Due to the competitive nature of the aviation industry, operators may be unable to pass on increases in fuel prices to their customers by increasing fares in a manner that fully offsets increased fuel costs. In addition, they may not be able to manage this risk by appropriately hedging their exposure to fuel price fluctuations. Airlines that do hedge their fuel costs can also be adversely affected by swift movements in fuel prices if such airlines are required as a result to post cash collateral under hedge agreements. Therefore, if fuel prices materially increase or show significant volatility, our lessees are likely to incur higher costs or generate lower revenues, which may affect their ability to meet their obligations to us. A sustained period of lower fuel costs may also adversely affect regional economies that depend on oil revenue, including those in which certain of our lessees operate. Should changes in fuel costs negatively affect our lessees or demand for our aircraft, our ability to execute our long-term strategy may be impacted.\nThe appreciation of the U.S. dollar could negatively impact our lessees\u2019 ability to honor the terms of their leases, which are generally denominated in U.S. dollars, and may result in lost revenues and reduced net income.\nMany of our lessees are exposed to currency risk due to the fact that they earn revenues in their local currencies while a significant portion of their liabilities and expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars, including their lease payments to us, as well as fuel, debt service, and other expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, more than 95% of our revenues were derived from customers who have their principal place of business outside the U.S. and most leases designated payment currency is U.S. dollars. The ability of our lessees to make lease payments to us in U.S. dollars may be adversely impacted in the event of an appreciating U.S. dollar. Our lessees may not be able to increase their revenues sufficiently to offset the impact of exchange rates on their lease payments and other expenses denominated in U.S. dollars. This is particularly true for non-U.S. airlines whose operations are primarily domestic. Shifts in foreign exchange rates can be significant, are difficult to predict, and can occur quickly. Should our lessees be unable to honor the terms of their leases due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar, we may experience lost revenues and reduced net income.\nEvents outside of our control, such as the threat or realization of epidemic diseases in addition to COVID-19, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, war or armed hostilities between countries or non-state actors, may adversely affect the demand for air travel, the financial condition of our lessees and of the aviation industry more broadly, and ultimately may our impact our business.\nAir travel has historically been disrupted, sometimes severely, by the occurrence of unexpected events outside of our control, and outside of the control of our lessees. For example, passenger demand for air travel is currently being severely impacted by COVID-19 and, in the past, has been negatively impacted by other epidemic diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, bird flu, swine flu, the Zika virus, and Ebola. Future epidemic diseases and other diseases, or the fear of such events and governmental responses to such events, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, could provoke responses that negatively affect passenger air travel. Air travel has also been disrupted in the past by natural disasters and other natural phenomena, such as extreme weather conditions, floods, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions, and by terrorist attacks, war or armed hostilities between countries or non-state actors, or the fear of such events.\nThe occurrence of any such event, or multiple such events, could cause our lessees to experience decreased passenger demand, to incur higher costs and to generate lower revenues, which could adversely affect their ability to make lease payments to us or to obtain the types and amounts of insurance we require. This in turn could lead to lease restructurings and repossessions, impair our ability to remarket or otherwise dispose of aircraft on favorable terms or at all, or reduce the proceeds we receive for our aircraft in a disposition which may ultimately impact our business.\nEconomic conditions and regulatory changes in the United Kingdom and Europe could result in decreased travel in the region which may have an adverse effect on our business in the region.\nAirlines whose principal place of business is Europe, including the U.K., represented 27.0% and 27.7% of our total revenue for the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The U.K. left the EU on January 31, 2020, with a transition period until December 31, 2020 during which time the U.K. followed EU rules and a U.K.-EU trade agreement was negotiated governing EU and U.K. relations from January 1, 2021 resulting in a Trade and Cooperation Agreement together with a Political Declaration covering a number of areas. As the partnership of the European Union and United Kingdom continues its transition, new potential risks for our business may arise. These risks may include, but are not limited to: reduced demand for our aircraft if air travel in the E.U. declines and fluctuations in market lease rates and lease margins which may have an adverse effect on our business in the region.\nRegulatory, tax and legal risks relating to our business\nOur multi-jurisdiction operations subject us to a wide range of income and other taxes that could negatively affect our business and operating results.\nWe operate in multiple jurisdictions and may become subject to a wide range of income and other taxes. If we are unable to execute our business in jurisdictions with favorable tax treatment, our operations may be subject to significant income and other taxes. Moreover, as our aircraft are operated by our lessees in multiple states and foreign jurisdictions, we may have nexus or taxable presence as a result of our aircraft landings in various states or foreign jurisdictions. Such landings may result in us being subject to various foreign, state and local taxes in such states or foreign jurisdictions. Further, any changes in tax laws in any of the jurisdictions that subject us to income or other taxes, such as increases in tax rates or limitations on our ability to deduct certain expenses from taxable income, such as depreciation expense and interest expense, could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. To the extent such changes are within the United States, we may be disproportionately impacted as compared to our competitor aircraft lessors.\nEnvironmental regulations, fees and taxes, and other concerns may negatively affect demand for our aircraft, reduce travel and ultimately impact the operating results of our customers.\nThe airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws, regulations, fees and taxes concerning emissions to the air, discharges to surface and subsurface waters, safe drinking water, aircraft noise, the management of hazardous substances, oils and waste materials and other regulations affecting aircraft operations. Governmental regulations regarding aircraft and engine noise and emissions levels apply based on where the relevant aircraft is registered and operated. These regulations could limit the economic life of the aircraft and engines, reduce their value, limit our ability to lease or sell the non-compliant aircraft and engines or, if engine modifications are permitted, require us to make significant additional investments in the aircraft and engines to make them compliant.\nFurther, compliance with current or future regulations, fees and taxes imposed to deal with environmental concerns could cause lessees to incur higher costs and to generate lower revenues, which could adversely affect their ability to make lease payments to us.\nThe airline industry has come under increased scrutiny by the press, the public and investors regarding the environmental impact of air travel. If such scrutiny results in reduced air travel, it may negatively affect demand for our aircraft, lessees\u2019 ability to make lease payments and reduce the value we receive for our aircraft upon any disposition.\nCorporate responsibility, specifically related to environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters, may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.\nPublic ESG and sustainability reporting is becoming more broadly expected by investors, shareholders and other third parties. Certain organizations that provide corporate governance and other corporate risk information to investors and shareholders have developed, and others may in the future develop, scores and ratings to evaluate companies and investment funds based upon ESG or \u201csustainability\u201d metrics. Many investment funds focus on positive ESG business practices and sustainability scores when making investments and may consider a company\u2019s ESG or sustainability scores as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision. In addition, investors, particularly institutional investors, use these scores to benchmark companies against their peers and if a company is perceived as lagging, these investors may engage with such company to improve ESG disclosure or performance and may also make voting decisions, or take other actions, to hold these companies and their boards of directors accountable. Board diversity is an ESG topic that is, in particular, receiving heightened attention by investors, shareholders, lawmakers and listing exchanges. Certain states, including California where we maintain our principal executive offices, have passed laws requiring companies to meet certain gender and ethnic diversity requirements on their boards of directors. If we are unable to recruit, attract and/or retain qualified members of our board of directors to maintain compliance with the diversity requirements of this California mandate within the prescribed timelines, we could be exposed to financial penalties. We may also face reputational damage in the event our corporate responsibility initiatives or objectives, including with respect to board diversity, do not meet the standards set by our investors, shareholders, lawmakers, listing exchanges or other constituencies, or if we are unable to achieve an acceptable ESG or sustainability rating from third party rating services. A low ESG or sustainability rating by a third-party rating service could also result in the exclusion of our common stock from consideration by certain investors who may elect to invest with our competition instead. Ongoing focus on corporate responsibility matters by investors and other parties as described above may impose additional costs or expose us to new risks.\nRisks and requirements related to transacting business in foreign countries may result in increased liabilities including penalties and fines as well as reputational harm.\nOur international operations expose us to trade and economic sanctions and other restrictions imposed by the United States or other governments or organizations. The U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce, State and Treasury and other foreign agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals for violations of economic sanctions laws, export control laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other federal statutes and regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and those established by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d), laws and regulations applicable to our operations in Ireland and Hong Kong and, increasingly, similar or more restrictive foreign laws, rules and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act (\u201cUKBA\u201d), which may also apply to us. Under these laws and regulations, the government may require export licenses, or impose restrictions that would require modifications to business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned persons or entities, and modifications to compliance programs, which may increase compliance costs. Failure to implement changes may subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions.\nWe have in place training programs for our employees with respect to FCPA, OFAC, UKBA, export controls and similar laws and regulations, but we cannot assure that our employees, consultants, sales agents, or associates will not engage in unlawful conduct for which we may be held responsible or that our business partners will not engage in conduct that could affect their ability to perform their contractual obligations and result in our being held liable for such conduct. Violation of laws or regulations may result in increased liabilities including penalties and fines as well as reputational harm.\nOur lessees may fail to obtain required licenses, consents and approvals, which could negatively affect our ability to remarket or sell aircraft.\nAirlines are subject to extensive regulation in the jurisdictions in which they are registered and operate. As a result, we expect some of our leases will require licenses, consents or approvals, including consents from governmental or regulatory authorities for certain payments under our leases and for the import, export or deregistration of aircraft. Subsequent changes in applicable law or administrative practice may require additional licenses and consents or result in revocation of prior licenses and consents. Furthermore, consents needed in connection with our repossession or sale of an aircraft may be withheld. Any of these events could negatively affect our ability to remarket or sell aircraft.\nData privacy risks, including evolving laws and regulations and compliance efforts, may result in business interruption and increased costs and liabilities.\nLaws and regulations relating to personal data constantly evolve, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new measures addressing data privacy and processing (including collection, storage, transfer, disposal, disclosure, security and use) of personal data, and the interpretation and application of many existing privacy and data protection laws and regulations in the U.S., Europe (including the E.U.\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act) and elsewhere are uncertain and fluid. Such laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices. Evolving compliance and operational requirements under the privacy laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate have become increasingly burdensome and complex. Privacy-related claims or lawsuits initiated by governmental bodies, customers or other third parties, irrespective of the merits, could be time consuming, result in costly regulatory proceedings, litigation, penalties and fines, require us to change our business practices or cause business interruptions and may lead to administrative, civil, or criminal liability.\nGeneral risk factors relating to investment in our stock\nProvisions in Delaware law and our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may inhibit a takeover of us, which could entrench management or cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests, including the ability of our board of directors to issue new series of preferred stock, a prohibition on stockholders calling special meetings, and advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations. In addition, we have not opted out of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a public Delaware corporation from engaging in certain business combinations with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (as defined in such section) for three years following the time that such stockholder became an interested stockholder without the prior consent of our board of directors. Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and these charter and bylaws provisions, may make the removal of management more difficult, impede a merger or other business combination or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our Class A common stock, which could reduce the market price of our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees or stockholders.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, (ii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers or other employees or stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws, or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision is intended to apply to claims arising under Delaware state law and would not apply to claims brought pursuant to the Exchange Act of 1934 or Securities Act of 1933, each as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. The exclusive forum provision in our amended and restated bylaws will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations. This exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees and stockholders. In addition, stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more\nfavorable to us than to our stockholders. However, the enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies' certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find this type of provision to be inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provision contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we might incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.\nFuture offerings of debt or equity securities by us may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may attempt to obtain financing or further increase our capital resources by issuing additional shares of Class A common stock, Series A Preferred Stock or offering debt or additional equity securities, including commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes, or new convertible or preferred securities. Issuing additional shares of Class A common stock or other equity may dilute the economic and voting rights of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our Class A common stock. Upon liquidation, holders of such debt securities, our Series A Preferred Stock and any new series of preferred shares, if issued, and lenders with respect to other borrowings, would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our Class A common stock. Our Series A Preferred Stock has a preference with respect to liquidating distributions and dividend payments which limits our ability to pay dividends to our Class A common stockholders, subject to certain conditions. Any new series of preferred shares could also have similar or different preferences. Our decision to issue securities in the future will depend on market conditions and we cannot predict the amount, timing or nature of such issuances, which could be dilutive to Class A stockholders and reduce the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may not be able to continue, or may elect to discontinue, paying dividends which may adversely affect our stock price.\nCurrent dividends may not be indicative of future dividends and our ability to continue to pay or increase dividends to our shareholders is subject to our board of director\u2019s discretion and depends on our ability to comply with covenants in our financing agreements and our Series A Preferred Stock that limit our ability to pay dividends and make certain restricted payments; difficulties in raising additional capital and our ability to finance our aircraft acquisition commitments; our ability to re-finance our long-term debt before excess cash flows are no longer made available to us to pay dividends and for other purposes; our ability to negotiate favorable lease rates and other contractual terms; demand for our aircraft; the economic condition of the commercial aviation industry generally; the financial condition and liquidity of our lessees; unexpected or increased expenses; the level and timing of aircraft investments, principal repayments and other capital needs; the value of our aircraft portfolio; our results of operations and general business conditions; legal restrictions on the payment of dividends; and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. In the future we may elect not to pay dividends, be unable to pay dividends or maintain or increase our current level of dividends, which may negatively affect our stock price.\nFuture sales of our Class A Common Stock by directors, executive officers or significant stockholders of Air Lease, or the perception these sales may occur, may cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders, in particular our directors, executive officers or other affiliates, sell substantial amounts of our Class A Common Stock in the public market, or are perceived by the public market as intending to sell, the trading price of our Class A Common Stock could decline. In addition, shares underlying any outstanding options and restricted stock units will become eligible for sale upon exercise or vesting, subject to Rule 144 of the Securities Act. All shares of Class A Common Stock subject to stock options and restricted stock units outstanding and reserved for issuance under the Air Lease Corporation 2014 Equity Incentive Plan have been registered on Form S-8 under the Securities Act and are eligible for sale in the public markets, subject to Rule 144 limitations applicable to affiliates. Sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity or equity related securities. A significant number of shares of our Class A Common Stock may be sold in the public market by any selling stockholders listed in a prospectus we may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and such sales, or the perception they may occur, could adversely affect market prices for our Class A Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 12641, "SIC": 7359, "TIC": "AL"}
