{"cik": "933136", "company": "WMIH CORP.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nThe risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the United States and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWMIH and its subsidiaries have limited operations; WMIH is a holding company, and its only material assets are cash on hand, cash held in trust and its equity interests in its operating subsidiary and its other investments, and WMIH\u2019s principal source of revenue and cash flow are distributions and certain payments from our wholly-owned subsidiary, WMMRC, which is operating in runoff mode and is subject to restrictions from paying us dividends and investment income from our investment portfolio.\nAs a holding company, our only material assets are our cash on hand, cash held in trust, the equity interests in our subsidiaries (WMMRC and WMIIC) and other investments. As of December 31, 2015, WMIH had no operations other than WMMRC\u2019s legacy reinsurance business with respect to mortgage insurance which is being operated in runoff mode. WMMRC has not written any new business since the Petition Date. As of December 31, 2015, excluding restricted cash and assets held in trust, we had approximately $76.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, which includes $6.5 million held by our wholly-owned subsidiary, WMMRC; WMIIC holds no assets and generates no revenues. For the foreseeable future, our principal source of revenue and cash flow will be investment income from our investment portfolio, if any, cash and cash equivalents on hand, distributions from our operating subsidiary, if any, and certain payments made to us by WMMRC pursuant to the Administrative Services Agreement, dated as of March 19, 2012, between WMIH and WMMRC (the \u201cAdministrative Services Agreement\u201d) and the Investment Management Agreement, dated as of March 19, 2012, between WMIH and WMMRC (the \u201cInvestment Management Agreement\u201d). WMMRC is restricted by the Second Lien Indenture from making distributions to WMIH until the Runoff Notes are paid in full and is restricted by insurance law from making distributions to us unless prior approval is obtained from the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Hawaii. Thus, our ability to service our debt, finance acquisitions and pay dividends to our stockholders in the future is dependent on (i) the ability of our operating subsidiary to generate sufficient net income and cash flows to make upstream cash distributions to us, and (ii) our ability to obtain access to the funds held in escrow from the Series B Preferred Stock Financing. Our subsidiaries are and will be separate legal entities, and although they may be wholly-owned or controlled by us, they have no obligation to make any funds available to us, whether in the form of loans, dividends, distributions or otherwise except for distributions of Runoff Proceeds (as defined in the Indentures) to pay the holders of the Runoff Notes under the Indentures. The ability of our operating subsidiary to distribute cash to us will also be subject to, among other things, restrictions that are contained in our Second Lien Indenture, availability of sufficient funds and applicable state laws and regulatory restrictions. Claims of creditors of our subsidiaries generally will have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and claims of our creditors and stockholders. To the extent the ability of our operating subsidiary to distribute dividends or other payments to us could be limited in any way, this could materially limit our ability to grow, pursue business opportunities or make acquisitions that could be beneficial to our businesses, fund and conduct our business or fund dividends, redemptions or repurchases.\nFuture acquisitions or business opportunities could involve unknown risks that could harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe are a holding company that holds all of the equity interests of WMMRC and WMIIC. In the future we intend to acquire other businesses or make other acquisitions that may involve unknown risks, some of which will be particular to the industry in which the business or acquisition target or targets operate. Although we intend to conduct business, financial and legal due diligence in connection with the evaluation of future business or acquisition opportunities, there can be no assurance our due diligence investigations will identify every matter that could have a material adverse effect on us. As a result of these factors, WMIH may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure operations or incur impairment or other charges that could result in reporting losses. The realization of any new or unknown risks could prevent or limit us from realizing the projected benefits of the businesses or acquisitions, which could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. In addition, our financial condition, results of operations and the ability to service our debt will be subject to the specific risks applicable to any business or company we acquire.\nThe nature of certain of our assets is volatile and their value may fluctuate or change over short periods of time.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $684.1 million cash, cash equivalents and securities, of which approximately $641.4 million was held directly by WMIH and approximately $42.7 million was held by WMMRC. Additionally, the WMIH cash balance includes $571.4 million of cash held in escrow under the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock escrow agreement. Under most circumstances, WMMRC\u2019s cash will not be available for use by WMIH until the Second Lien Notes are paid in full. Investing in securities other than U.S. government instruments will likely result in a higher risk of loss to us, particularly in light of uncertain domestic and global political, credit and financial market conditions. We value these securities for various purposes based on a number of factors, including, without limitation, third-party independent valuations. Because valuations, and particularly valuations of private securities and illiquid securities, are inherently uncertain, such valuations may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time and may differ materially from the values that would have been obtained if an active market existed for these securities.\nWMIH, together with its subsidiaries, may not be able to fully utilize our net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) and other tax carry forwards.\nAs of December 31, 2012, WMIH and its subsidiaries had U.S. federal NOLs of approximately $7.54 billion, of which approximately $5.97 billion was allocated to that portion of 2012 after the ownership change described below, that, if unused, will begin to expire in 2031. We believe that, as of December 31, 2015, WMIH and its subsidiaries had NOLs not subject to limitation under Section 382 (\u201cSection 382\u201d) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) of approximately $6.0 billion. Both WMIH and WMMRC caused 100% valuation allowances to be recorded against these deferred tax assets.\nOn the Effective Date, we believe that we experienced an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. An ownership change is generally defined as a more than 50 percentage point collective increase in equity ownership by\n\u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d (as that term is defined for purposes of Sections 382 and 383 of the Code) in any rolling three-year period or since the last ownership change if such prior ownership change occurred within the prior three-year period. As a result of such ownership change on the Effective Date, the limitations on the use of pre-change losses and other carry forward tax attributes in Sections 382 and 383 of the Code apply and we will be able to utilize only a small portion of the NOL carry forwards from the years prior to 2012 and the portion of the NOL for 2012 allocable to the portion of the year prior to March 20, 2012. The utilization of the NOL for 2012 allocable to the portion of the year after the Effective Date and the NOLs from subsequent years should not be affected by the ownership change on the Effective Date.\nOur ability (including any subsidiary or subsidiaries acquired in any Acquisition (as defined in the Designation of Rights and Preferences of the 3% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cCertificate of Designation\u201d) creating the Series B Preferred Stock)), to utilize their NOLs and other tax carry forwards to reduce taxable income in future years could be limited for various reasons, including if projected future taxable income is insufficient to recognize the full benefit of such NOL carry forwards prior to their expiration and/or the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) challenges that a transaction or transactions were concluded with the principal purpose of evasion or avoidance of Federal income tax. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income in later years to enable us to use the NOLs before they expire, or that the IRS will not challenge the use of all or any portion of the NOLs. Additionally, our ability (and the ability of any future subsidiary or subsidiaries) to fully use these tax assets could also be adversely affected if the respective companies were deemed to have another \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. Although we have certain transfer restrictions in place under our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended, the \u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d), our Board of Directors could issue additional shares of stock or permit future conversions or redemptions of our stock, which, depending on their magnitude, could result in ownership changes that would trigger the imposition of additional limitations on the utilization of our NOLs under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that, in the future, WMIH and/or its subsidiaries (and any future subsidiary) will be able to utilize its NOLs or not experience additional limitations on utilizing the tax benefits of their NOLs and other tax carry forwards. Such limitations could have a material adverse effect on WMIH and/or its subsidiaries\u2019 results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nIn an attempt to minimize the likelihood of an additional ownership change occurring, our Certificate of Incorporation contains transfer restrictions limiting the acquisition (and disposition) of our stock or any other instrument treated as stock for purposes of Section 382 by persons or group of persons treated as a single entity under Treasury Regulation Section 1.382-3 owning (actually or constructively), or who would own as a result of the transaction, 4.75% of the total value of our stock (including any other interests treated as stock for purposes of Section 382). Nevertheless, it is possible that we could undergo an additional ownership change, either by events within or outside of the control of our Board, e.g., indirect changes in the ownership of persons owning 5% of our stock. Also, in the event that the Second Lien Notes are re-characterized as equity, transfers of Second Lien Notes might be taken into account for purposes of Section 382. Moreover, approximately 1.5 million shares of WMIH\u2019s common stock are held in escrow in the Disputed Equity Escrow (as defined in the Plan). A subsequent release or transfer of the stock potentially could result in an ownership change of WMIH at that time. In the event of a subsequent ownership change, all or part of the NOLs from 2012 and subsequent years that were not previously subject to limitations under Section 382 could also become subject to an annual limitation.\nThe IRS could challenge the amount, timing and/or use of our NOL carry forwards.\nThe amount of our NOL carry forwards has not been audited or otherwise validated by the IRS. Among other things, the IRS could challenge whether an ownership change occurred on the Effective Date, as well as the amount, the timing and/or our use of our NOLs. Any such challenge, if successful, could significantly limit our ability to utilize a portion or all of our NOL carry forwards. In addition, calculating whether an ownership change has occurred within the meaning of Section 382 is subject to inherent uncertainty, both because of the complexity of applying Section 382 and because of limitations on a publicly-traded company\u2019s knowledge as to the ownership of, and transactions in, its securities. Therefore, the calculation of the amount of our utilizable NOL carry forwards could be changed as a result of a successful challenge by the IRS or as a result of new information about the ownership of, and transactions in, our securities.\nPossible changes in legislation could negatively affect our ability to use the tax benefits associated with our NOL carry forwards.\nThe rules relating to U.S. federal income taxation are periodically under review by persons involved in the legislative and administrative rulemaking processes, by the IRS and by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, resulting in revisions of regulations and revised interpretations of established concepts as well as statutory changes. Future revisions in U.S. federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could adversely impact our ability to use some or all of the tax benefits associated with our NOL carry forwards.\nIf we are unable to identify and/or make acquisitions or there are delays in finding suitable acquisition targets or we make acquisitions that are not successful, WMIH will likely never achieve sustained profitability, which would adversely affect the value of the Company.\nOur ability to successfully execute an acquisition strategy will impact our ability to achieve profitability and grow our business. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in this endeavor. We may need additional capital to complete an acquisition, but there can be no assurances that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital at all or on commercially reasonable terms. WMIH\u2019s inability to make one or more acquisitions will impair WMIH\u2019s ability to be profitable. WMIH may not be able to achieve profitability on a sustained basis. There may be a substantial period of time before we are able to invest and make suitable acquisitions. Delays we encounter in the selection, acquisition and/or development of targets could adversely affect the value of the Company.\nWhile we continue to work diligently to identify suitable acquisition targets, there can be no assurance that (a) we will be able to identify any such acquisition targets, or (b) we will be able to consummate an acquisition if and when an acquisition target is identified.\nOur Board may change our investment strategy without stockholder approval, which could alter the nature of your investment.\nOur Board continues to develop and review the strategic and investment strategy for the Company and determine what is in the best interest of our stockholders. This strategy may change over time. The methods of implementing our strategy may vary, as trends emerge and new investment opportunities develop. Our strategy, the methods for its implementation, and our other objectives, may be altered by our Board without the approval of our stockholders. As a result, the nature of your investment could change without your consent.\nChanges in disclosure laws or interpretations resulting in higher compliance costs are likely to adversely affect WMIH\u2019s future consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nCompliance with laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and new regulations enacted by the SEC, are resulting in increased compliance costs. WMIH, like all other public companies, is incurring expenses and diverting employees\u2019 time in an effort to comply with such laws. WMIH is an accelerated filer reporting company, and has completed the process of documenting and evaluating its systems of internal control. We expect to continue to devote the necessary resources, including internal and external resources, to support WMIH\u2019s assessment and compliance with its disclosure obligations as these disclosure obligations evolve and change. In addition, during the bankruptcy, WMIHC adopted so-called \u201cModified Exchange Act Reporting\u201d under SLB 2. WMIH continues to rely upon the guidance set forth in SLB 2 and we have filed and will continue to file the Exchange Act periodic reports for all periods that begin after the Effective Date of the Plan. If the SEC determines that WMIH is not able to follow or rely on Modified Exchange Act Reporting under SLB 2, much more extensive historical disclosure requirements could be imposed on WMIH which we may not be able to satisfy and which would have a material adverse effect on the Company, including but not limited to, substantial compliance costs and sanctions. Compliance with different or evolving standards will result in increased general and administrative expenses and may cause a significant diversion of our time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities and could subject WMIH to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities.\nLitigation against us could be costly and time consuming to defend.\nWe may from time to time be subject to legal proceedings and claims from third parties. Litigation may result in substantial costs and may divert our attention and WMIH resources, which may seriously harm our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\nAn unfavorable judgment against us in any legal proceeding or claim could require us to pay monetary damages. In addition, an unfavorable judgment in which the counterparty is awarded equitable relief, such as an injunction, could have an adverse impact on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\nBecause our operations and acquisition strategy are highly dependent on key executives and employees, our inability to recruit and retain capable management could hinder our current operations and business plans.\nAlthough we appointed William C. Gallagher as our Chief Executive Officer and Thomas L. Fairfield as our President and Chief Operating Officer in 2015, we have very limited staffing and management resources and are highly dependent on consultants and certain key employees. WMIH\u2019s Chief Legal Officer and Secretary, Charles Edward Smith, is an employee of the Trust, and our Interim Chief Financial Officer, Timothy F. Jaeger, is a self-employed consultant engaged by the Company to provide financial reporting services. As of December 31, 2015, in addition to Messrs. Gallagher and Fairfield, the Company had two additional employees. However, minimal staffing and any inability we may have to engage new executive officers or key employees in the event any of our executive officers or key employees terminates employment could have a material adverse impact on our operations or delay or curtail the attainment of WMIH\u2019s objectives.\nBusiness interruptions could limit our ability to operate our business.\nOur operations, as well as others on which we depend, are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire; natural disasters, including earthquakes; computer viruses; human error; power shortages; telecommunication failures; international acts of terror; and similar events. Our offices are located in Seattle, Washington and we currently obtain certain key services from the Trust pursuant to the TSA. The TSA, as amended, is currently in effect through April 30, 2016, with automatic renewals thereafter for successive additional three-month terms, subject to non-renewal at the end of any additional term upon written notice by either party at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the additional term.\nAlthough we have certain business continuity plans in place, we have not established a formal comprehensive disaster recovery plan, and our back-up operations and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate for losses we may suffer. A significant business interruption, including an unexpected non-renewal or termination of the TSA, could result in losses or damages incurred by us and require that we cease or curtail our operations at our current location.\nWe are subject to regulation by various federal and state entities.\nWe are subject to the regulations of the SEC and the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Hawaii. New regulations issued by these agencies may adversely affect our ability to carry on our business activities. We are subject to various federal and state laws and certain changes in these laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations. Noncompliance with certain of these regulations may impact our business plans.\nWe are also subject to the accounting rules and regulations of the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Changes in accounting rules could adversely affect the reported financial statements or our results of operations and may also require extraordinary efforts or additional costs to implement. Any of these laws or regulations may be modified or changed from time to time, and there is no assurance that such modifications or changes will not adversely affect us.\nDue to the increased number of holders of our Second Lien Notes, any future actions, including, but not limited to, commutations, that require the consent of the holders of our Second Lien Notes are likely to be more time consuming and expensive, and there can be no assurance that the requisite consent will be obtained.\nIn connection with, and as a condition to, the completion of the transactions contemplated by the commutation agreement between WMMRC and UGRIC, we obtained the consent of the Trust, at the time the beneficial owner of at least two-thirds in aggregate principal amount of the notes outstanding under the Indentures, to certain limited waiver agreements. On May 1, 2014, the Trust distributed the Runoff Notes held by the Trust to certain beneficiaries, and as a result is no longer the beneficial owner of at least two-thirds in aggregate principal amount of the Runoff Notes. A majority of these Runoff Notes were distributed to individual beneficiary brokerage accounts, and certain of the Runoff Notes were certificated and sent to other holders. Subsequent to such distribution, we paid in full our First Lien Notes, but our Second Lien Notes remain held by multiple holders. Consequently, due to the increased number of holders, any future actions, including, but not limited to, commutations, that require the consent of the holders of our Second Lien Notes are likely to be more time consuming and expensive, and there can be no assurance that the requisite consent will be obtained.\nRisks Related to Owning WMIH\u2019s Stock\nWMIH\u2019s common stock, and any other instruments treated as stock for purposes of Section 382 (including the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock), are subject to transfer restrictions under WMIH\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation.\nWMIH\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation contains significant transfer restrictions in relation to the transfer of WMIH\u2019s common stock and any other instruments treated as stock for purposes of Section 382 (including the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock). These court-approved transfer restrictions have been adopted in order to minimize the likelihood that we will be deemed to have an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 that could limit our ability to utilize WMIH\u2019s NOL carry forwards under and in accordance with regulations promulgated by the IRS. In particular, without the approval of our Board, (i) no person or group of persons treated as a single entity under Treasury Regulation Section 1.382-3 will be permitted to acquire, whether directly or indirectly, and whether in one transaction or a series of related transactions, any of WMIH\u2019s common stock or any other instrument treated as stock for purposes of Section 382, to the extent that after giving effect to such purported acquisition (a) the purported acquirer or any other person by reason of the purported acquirer\u2019s acquisition would become a Substantial Holder (as defined below), or (b) the percentage stock ownership of a person that, prior to giving effect to the purported acquisition, is already a Substantial Holder would be increased; and (ii) no Substantial Holder may dispose, directly or indirectly, of any class of stock or any other instrument treated as stock for purposes of Section 382. A \u201cSubstantial Holder\u201d is a person that owns (as determined for purposes of Section 382) at least 4.75% of the total value of our stock, including any instrument treated as stock for purposes of Section 382.\nWMIH\u2019s common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d). If we do not comply with NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements, these shares may be delisted from NASDAQ, which would likely result in WMIH\u2019s shares being traded on the OTC Pink and negatively affect the liquidity and trading prices of WMIH\u2019s common stock.\nWMIH\u2019s common stock is currently listed on NASDAQ. In order to maintain eligibility for continued listing on NASDAQ, we must fulfill certain minimum listing requirements and there can be no assurance that we can maintain such minimum listing requirements. If WMIH is not able to maintain the listing of its common stock on NASDAQ, WMIH could face material adverse consequences, including:\n\u00b7\na limited availability of market quotations for its common stock;\n\u00b7\nreduced liquidity for its common stock;\n\u00b7\na determination that its common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in such common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for WMIH\u2019s common stock; and\n\u00b7\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws (\u201cBylaws\u201d) and under Delaware law could make a third party acquisition of WMIH difficult.\nWMIH\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws currently contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire WMIH, even if doing so might be deemed beneficial by WMIH\u2019s stockholders. These provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of WMIH\u2019s common stock. WMIH is also subject to certain provisions of Delaware law that could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of WMIH.\nWe may need to sell additional shares of WMIH\u2019s common stock or other securities in the future to meet WMIH\u2019s capital requirements. In such circumstances, the ownership interests of WMIH\u2019s stockholders prior to such sale could be substantially diluted.\nWMIH has 3,500,000,000 shares of common stock authorized for issuance and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized for issuance. As of March 1, 2016, WMIH had 206,168,035 shares of its common stock issued and outstanding. The possibility of dilution posed by shares available for future sale could reduce the market price of WMIH\u2019s common stock and could make it more difficult for WMIH to raise funds through equity offerings in the future. In fact, WMIH has consummated two corporate financing transactions that are, on an as-converted basis, dilutive to stockholders. Specifically, in connection with our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d) offering, effective January 30, 2014, WMIH issued 1,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, which may be converted into 10,065,629 shares of WMIH\u2019s common stock, and Warrants to purchase 61,400,000 shares of WMIH\u2019s common stock; and on January 5, 2015, in connection with the Series B Preferred Stock Financing, WMIH issued 600,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, which may be converted into 342,857,143 shares of WMIH\u2019s common stock.\nThe value of WMIH\u2019s common stock may be affected by terms and conditions of the Series B Preferred Stock, which is senior in priority to WMIH\u2019s common stock. See \u201cRisk Related to the Series B Preferred Stock\u201d.\nThe redemption or repurchase of our Series B Preferred Stock may have a material adverse effect on holders of WMIH\u2019s common stock.\nWe have limited business operations and assets. If we redeem or repurchase our Series B Preferred Stock, it is likely that our business and financial prospects will be adversely affected and the holders of WMIH\u2019s common stock are likely to lose a significant part or all of their investment. While we would expect to seek alternative financing under those circumstances, there can be no assurance such financing would be available at terms we would determine to be acceptable, or at all.\nRisks Related to the Series B Preferred Stock\nThe Series B Preferred Stock ranks junior to all of our indebtedness and other liabilities.\nIn the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other winding-up, our assets will be available to pay obligations on the Series B Preferred Stock only after all of our indebtedness and other liabilities have been paid. The rights of holders of the Series B Preferred Stock to participate in the distribution of our assets will rank pari passu with our Series A Preferred Stock and any parity stock we issue in the future. In addition, we are a holding company and the Series B Preferred Stock will effectively rank junior to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries and any capital stock of our subsidiaries not held by us. The rights of holders of the Series B Preferred Stock to participate in the distribution of assets of our subsidiaries will rank junior to the prior claims of that subsidiary\u2019s creditors and any other equity holders. Consequently, if we are forced to liquidate our assets to pay our creditors, we may not have sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding. We and our subsidiaries may incur substantial amounts of additional debt and other obligations that will rank senior to the Series B Preferred Stock.\nWe are not obligated to pay dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock and we are subject to restrictions on payment of dividends on shares of our capital stock.\nDividends on the Series B Preferred Stock are payable only when, as and if declared by our Board or an authorized committee thereof, out of funds legally available therefor. Our Board is not legally obligated to declare dividends.\nDelaware law provides that dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock may only be paid from \u201csurplus\u201d or, if there is no \u201csurplus,\u201d from the corporation\u2019s net profits for the then-current or the preceding fiscal year. Unless we operate profitably, our ability to pay dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock would require the availability of adequate \u201csurplus,\u201d which is defined as the excess, if any, of our net assets (total assets less total liabilities) over our capital. Since the Effective Date, we have often not achieved profitability, and when profitable, did not achieve significant profitability. We do not expect to achieve significant profits in the future unless we consummate an acquisition.\nWe may also enter into debt or other agreements in the future that may restrict us from paying dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock.\nFurther, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Delaware law, as applicable, to pay dividends on the shares of Series B Preferred stock, we may not have sufficient cash to do so. See \u201c-We may not have sufficient funds to redeem or repurchase the Series B Preferred Stock or pay dividends.\u201d\nWe are subject to restrictions on the redemption or repurchase of the Series B Preferred Stock.\nUnder the Certificate of Designation of the Series B Preferred Stock, we will be obligated to redeem the Series B Preferred Stock on the Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below) and to repurchase the Series B Preferred Stock tendered for repurchase upon a Put Event (as defined below). However, we may be unable to redeem or repurchase the Series B Preferred Stock under applicable law or due to contractual restrictions.\nDelaware law provides that a redemption or repurchase payment on capital stock may only be paid from \u201csurplus\u201d or, if there is no \u201csurplus,\u201d from the corporation\u2019s net profits for the then-current or the preceding fiscal year. Unless we operate profitably, our ability to redeem the Series B Preferred Stock would require the availability of adequate \u201csurplus,\u201d which is defined as the excess, if any, of our net assets (total assets less total liabilities) over our capital. Since the Effective Date, we have often not achieved profitability, and when profitable, did not achieve significant profitability. We do not expect to achieve significant profits in the future unless we consummate an acquisition.\nWe may also enter into debt or other agreements in the future that may restrict us from redeeming or repurchasing the Series B Preferred Stock.\nFurther, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Delaware law, as applicable, to redeem or repurchase the shares of Series B Preferred Stock, we may not have sufficient cash to do so. See \u201c-We may not have sufficient funds to redeem or repurchase the Series B Preferred Stock or pay dividends.\u201d\nWe may not consummate a Qualified Acquisition.\nWe may not consummate a Qualified Acquisition (as defined below) due to inability to find an appropriate target company or companies, an inability to obtain appropriate financing, an inability to agree to the terms of an acquisition(s) or for any other reason. We anticipate that the assessment of each specific target business, and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments relevant to the acquisition of any such target business, will require substantial time and attention on the part of our management and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If we decide not to complete a Qualified Acquisition, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, if we reach an agreement relating to a specific target business, we may fail to complete our initial business combination for any number of reasons, including those beyond our control. Any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business.\nFurthermore, we expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships) and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we may consider for acquisition. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable may be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation may give others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, because we are required to redeem the Series B Preferred Stock (if not previously converted) on the third anniversary of January 5, 2015 if we have not consummated a Qualified Acquisition, target companies will be aware of this, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination.\nWe may also consummate an acquisition or acquisitions that do not constitute a Qualified Acquisition.\nWe may not have sufficient funds to pay the Mandatory Redemption Price (as defined below) in the event we use some of the proceeds from the Series B Preferred Stock Offering to consummate one or more acquisitions that do not constitute a Qualified Acquisition and we may be unable to obtain additional financing to fund such Mandatory Redemption Price. See \u201c-We may not have sufficient funds to redeem or repurchase the Series B Preferred Stock or pay dividends.\u201d\nThe Series B Preferred Stock is not convertible at the option of holders.\nAll or a portion of the Series B Preferred Stock automatically converts into WMIH\u2019s common stock upon an Acquisition (as defined below) or a Qualified Acquisition, as the case may be. If an Acquisition does not occur, none of the Series B Preferred Stock will convert into WMIH\u2019s common stock. If an Acquisition occurs but a Qualified Acquisition does not occur, only a portion of the Series B Preferred Stock will not convert into WMIH\u2019s common stock. Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock will have no right to convert their shares of Series B Preferred Stock at their option into WMIH\u2019s common stock. Furthermore, if an Acquisition or a Qualified Acquisition does occur, the Series B Preferred Stock will automatically convert into WMIH\u2019s common stock at a conversion price no less than the Floor Price (as defined in the Certificate of Designation) even if such conversion is unfavorable because WMIH\u2019s common stock is trading below the Floor Price.\nThe price of WMIH\u2019s common stock, and therefore of the Series B Preferred Stock, may fluctuate significantly, which may make it difficult for a holder to resell the Series B Preferred Stock or WMIH common stock issuable upon mandatory conversion thereof when a holder wants or at prices a holder may find attractive.\nThe market price of WMIH\u2019s common stock may continue to fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, financial markets in general (including the stock market) have, of late, experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of WMIH\u2019s common stock. Because the Series B Preferred Stock is mandatorily convertible into shares of WMIH\u2019s common stock upon the consummation of an Acquisition or a Qualified Acquisition, volatility or depressed prices for WMIH\u2019s common stock could have a similar effect on the trading price of the Series B Preferred Stock. Holders who have received shares of WMIH\u2019s common stock upon mandatory conversion of their shares of Series B Preferred Stock will also be subject to the risk of volatility and depressed prices.\nIn addition, the market price of WMIH\u2019s common stock could also be affected by possible sales of WMIH\u2019s common stock by investors who view the Series B Preferred Stock as a more attractive means of equity participation in us and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving WMIH\u2019s common stock. The hedging or arbitrage could, in turn, affect the trading price of the Series B Preferred Stock or any WMIH common stock that holders receive upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock.\nThe conversion price of the Series B Preferred Stock may not be adjusted for all dilutive events that may adversely affect the market price of the Series B Preferred Stock or the WMIH common stock issuable upon mandatory conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock.\nThe number of shares of WMIH\u2019s common stock that holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive upon mandatory conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock is subject to adjustment for certain specified events, including, but not limited to, stock splits, stock recombinations, or tender or exchange offers for common stock of WMIH (which events are more limited than customary for convertible securities because the holders of Series B Preferred Stock participate in dividends on WMIH\u2019s common stock on an as converted basis). However, other events, which may adversely affect the market price of WMIH\u2019s common stock, may not result in any adjustment, such as the issuance of WHIH\u2019s common stock in an acquisition or for cash. Further, if any of these other events adversely affects the market price of WMIH\u2019s common stock, we expect it to also adversely affect the market price of our Series B Preferred Stock. In addition, the terms of our Series B Preferred Stock do not restrict our ability to offer WMIH\u2019s common stock or securities convertible into WMIH\u2019s common stock in the future or to engage in other transactions that could dilute WMIH\u2019s common stock. We have no obligation to consider the interests of the holders of our Series B Preferred Stock in engaging in any such offering or transaction.\nWe may issue additional series of preferred stock that rank equally to the Series B Preferred Stock as to dividend payments and liquidation preference.\nNeither our Certificate of Incorporation nor the terms governing the Series B Preferred Stock prohibits us from issuing additional series of preferred stock that would rank equally to the Series B Preferred Stock as to dividend payments and liquidation preference. Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that we have the authority to issue 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, including the 600,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and the 1,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The issuances of other series of preferred stock could have the effect of reducing the amounts available to the Series B Preferred Stock in the event of our liquidation, winding-up or dissolution. It may also reduce dividend payments on the Series B Preferred Stock if we do not have sufficient funds to pay dividends on all Series B Preferred Stock outstanding and outstanding parity preferred stock.\nHolders of Series B Preferred Stock will have limited rights with respect to the shares of WMIH common stock issuable upon mandatory conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock until the Series B Preferred Stock is converted, but may be adversely affected by certain changes made with respect to WMIH\u2019s common stock.\nHolders of Series B Preferred Stock will have limited rights with respect to the shares of WMIH\u2019s common stock issuable upon mandatory conversion of Series B Preferred Stock, including rights to respond to WMIH\u2019s common stock tender offers, if any, prior to the issuance of shares of WMIH\u2019s common stock upon mandatory conversion, if any, but an investment in our Series B Preferred Stock may be negatively affected by these events. Upon mandatory conversion, a holder of Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to exercise the rights of a holder of WMIH\u2019s common stock only as to matters for which the relevant record date occurs on or after the applicable mandatory conversion date.\nFuture issuances of preferred stock may adversely affect the market price for WMIH\u2019s common stock.\nAdditional issuances and sales of preferred stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales could occur, may cause prevailing market prices for WMIH\u2019s common stock to decline and may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital in the financial markets at times and prices favorable to us.\nWe may not have sufficient funds to redeem or repurchase the Series B Preferred Stock or pay dividends.\nWe are required to redeem the Series B Preferred Stock (if not previously converted) on the third anniversary of January 5, 2015 (the \u201cIssue Date\u201d) in the event we have not consummated a Qualified Acquisition. In addition, we are required to offer to repurchase (if not previously converted) the Series B Preferred Stock upon a Change of Control or Post-Closing Covenant Default (as such terms are defined in the Certificate of Designation creating the Series B Preferred Stock). Furthermore, if and when declared by our Board and until the Series B Preferred Stock is converted, we are required to pay cumulative regular dividends out of funds legally available therefor at an annual rate of 3% per share of the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share of Series B Preferred Stock. However, we may not have sufficient funds, and we may be unable to obtain additional financing, to make such a redemption, repurchase or pay dividends as required, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company and the value of our capital stock. This risk is increased by the fact that we (i) have very limited operations, (ii) in the past have not generated significant cash flows, (iii) may use net proceeds that have been deposited into the escrow account in connection with the Series B Preferred Stock Financing to explore and fund, in whole or in part, acquisitions whether completed or not, including reasonable attorney fees and expenses, accounting expenses, due diligence and financial advisor fees and expenses, and (iv) may consummate an acquisition or acquisitions that do not constitute a Qualified Acquisition (and accordingly may use net proceeds that have been deposited into the escrow account), which may cause us to have insufficient funds to redeem or repurchase the Series B Preferred Stock as required or pay dividends. The Company and our auditors will periodically assess our ability to redeem or repurchase the Series B Preferred Stock. If the Company and our auditors determine that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to our inability to redeem or repurchase the Series B Preferred Stock and we are unable to refinance or obtain access to additional funding, our auditors could issue a going concern qualification to our financial statements. A \u201cgoing concern\u201d opinion could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of equity, incurrence of debt or other financing alternatives and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and the value of our capital stock.\nWe may not have sufficient earnings and profits in order for dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock to be treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nThe dividends payable by us on the Series B Preferred Stock may exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If that occurs, it will result in the amount of the dividends that exceed such earnings and profits being treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes first as a return of capital to the extent of the holder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in the Series B Preferred Stock, and the excess, if any, over such adjusted tax basis as capital gain. Such treatment will generally be unfavorable for corporate holders and may also be unfavorable to certain other holders.\nHolders of Series B Preferred Stock may be subject to tax if we make or fail to make certain adjustments to the conversion price of the Series B Preferred Stock even though a holder of Series B Preferred Stock does not receive a corresponding cash distribution.\nThe conversion price of the Series B Preferred Stock is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. If the conversion price is adjusted as a result of a distribution that is taxable to WMIH\u2019s common stockholders, a holder of Series B Preferred Stock may be deemed to have received a dividend subject to U.S. federal income tax to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits without the receipt of any cash. In addition, a failure to adjust (or to adjust adequately) the conversion price after an event that increases a Series B Preferred Stockholder\u2019s proportionate interest in us could be treated as a deemed taxable dividend to such holder. If a holder of Series B Preferred Stock is a non-U.S. holder, any deemed dividend may be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a 30% rate, or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable treaty, which may be set off against subsequent payments on the Series B Preferred Stock. A non-U.S. holder is a beneficial owner of Series B Preferred Stock or WMIH\u2019s common stock received in respect thereof (other than a partnership or entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and that is not a U.S. holder.\nAffiliates of KKR own a substantial amount of equity interests in us, and have other substantial interests in us and agreements with us, and may have conflicts of interest with us or the other holders of our capital stock.\nAs of March 1, 2016, affiliates of KKR held approximately 29.4% of WMIH\u2019s common stock (after giving effect to the exercise of outstanding Warrants and the conversion of each of the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock). Affiliates of KKR are parties to, the Investment Agreement and the Investor Rights Agreement.\nAs a result, affiliates of KKR may have substantial influence over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and may have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of stockholders regardless of whether other holders of our capital stock believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests. For example, affiliates of KKR could potentially cause us to refrain from making acquisitions in a manner that is not in the best interests of holders of the Series B Preferred Stock. KKR will not provide oversight of or have control over or be involved with the investment activities or other operations of the Company.\nNeither KKR nor its director appointees are required to present us with investment opportunities and may pursue them separately or otherwise compete with us.\nNeither KKR nor its director appointees are obligated to present us with investment opportunities. Moreover, each of KKR, our officers and our directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which KKR, such officer or such director is required to present an acquisition opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of KKR, our officers or our directors becomes aware of an acquisition opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, it, he or she will honor its, his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such acquisition opportunity to such other entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that we renounce our interest or expectancy in any corporate opportunity in which KKR or its director appointees seek to participate unless such opportunity (i) was first presented to KKR\u2019s director appointees solely in their capacity as directors of WMIH or (ii) is identified by KKR or its director appointees solely through the disclosure of information by or on behalf of us. We will not be prohibited from pursuing an investment opportunity with respect to which we have renounced our interest or expectancy.\nAdditionally, KKR is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us or that compete with us for acquisitions. KKR may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, KKR\u2019s interest in its portfolio companies could impact our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities.\nKKR is not our investment advisor and owes no fiduciary duty to us or to holders of WMIH\u2019s common stock, Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock.\nKKR is not our investment adviser and otherwise has no advisory, fiduciary or similar relationship with us or with holders of WMIH\u2019s common stock or Series B Preferred Stock. KKR is not our sponsor, and the Company is not an investment product offered by KKR. KKR has no obligations (contractual, fiduciary or otherwise) to us, disclaims having any liability for our performance, investments or activities, and will not be responsible for any action or inaction of our management.\nRisks Related to WMMRC\u2019s Business\nGeneral economic conditions that negatively affect housing prices may continue to negatively affect the credit performance of WMMRC\u2019s underlying portfolio of mortgage loans and could continue to have an adverse effect on our future performance.\nThe outlook for the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and there can be no assurances that recent signs of improvement in the housing and credit markets will continue or improve. Prolonged high unemployment and further deterioration in the housing markets could negatively impact the performance of WMMRC\u2019s underlying mortgage assets leading to a potential increase in defaults and losses.\nThe negative financial performance of the primary mortgage insurers with whom WMMRC does business is likely to negatively affect our financial performance and results.\nOne or more of the primary mortgage insurers with whom we do business may be vulnerable to adverse market conditions and because of that uncertainty there can be no assurances that such insurers can withstand the current market and financial pressures they may face from time to time. In fact, at least one counterparty is currently operating subject to state supervision. These factors could have negative consequences for WMMRC\u2019s cash flows and WMMRC\u2019s ability to pay dividends to WMIH in the future, which in turn could adversely affect WMIH\u2019s ability to service the Runoff Notes.\nWMMRC is dependent on primary mortgage insurers to provide it with services. A disruption in the provision of such services could negatively affect WMMRC\u2019s operations and financial performance.\nWMMRC depends upon our primary mortgage insurers to provide us with several services, including providing us with the monthly cession statements that provides the basis for our accounting and financial records, information regarding applicable minimum capital thresholds, the establishment of ceded loss reserves, the payment of ceded premium (i.e., revenue) and the withdrawal of funds for paid losses. If our counterparties are unable to provide such services or if such services are otherwise interrupted or modified as a result of actions beyond our control (e.g., the placement of a counterparty into receivership or conservatorship), then such actions may be detrimental to our future financial performance.\nBecause loss reserve estimates are subject to uncertainties and are based on assumptions that are currently volatile, ceded paid losses may be substantially different from our ceded loss reserves.\nThe establishment of loss reserves is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that is inherently uncertain. In addition, establishing such loss reserves requires management to make various assumptions and judgments based on a variety of factors, including frequency of losses, severity of losses and timing of losses. As a result, WMMRC periodically monitors and adjusts its assumptions based on actual loan performance information, market indicators and other factors. Nevertheless, factors outside of WMMRC\u2019s control, such as the overall performance of the economy, volatile housing prices, public policy considerations and borrower behavior all influence its assumptions and are subject to considerable change over time.\nLoan loss mitigation efforts (including efforts to modify loans, effect short sales, loan rescissions and claim denials) by the firms servicing our underlying reinsured mortgage loans may not be effective.\nWMMRC relies on the servicers of the mortgage loans to provide surveillance, loss mitigation and salvage efforts to ensure that the mortgage loans it reinsures are serviced according to the appropriate guidelines and significant efforts are made to ensure a beneficial outcome. Nevertheless, there can be no assurances that such efforts will be successful or have any effect on the ultimate ability of a borrower to satisfy such borrower\u2019s obligations under a mortgage WMMRC has reinsured.\nLow interest rates can negatively affect WMMRC\u2019s financial performance.\nA low interest rate environment can negatively affect WMMRC\u2019s financial performance. Low interest rates provide an opportunity for generally well-qualified borrowers to refinance their mortgage loans. This typically results in a cancelation of the mortgage insurance policy applicable to such loans and terminates any future premium ceded we would expect from those loans. As a result, the portfolio of mortgage loans WMMRC reinsures could experience a larger percentage in the number of borrowers who are less creditworthy. Additionally, a low-interest rate environment generally results in lower yields on WMMRC\u2019s investment portfolio, as maturing investments are generally reinvested at lower yields thereby reducing investment income.\nWMMRC is subject to comprehensive regulations, including minimum capital standards, which are subject to change and may harm our business.\nWMMRC is domiciled in the State of Hawaii and is subject to the rules and regulations as promulgated by the State of Hawaii and its Department of Insurance, its primary state regulator. Foremost among those rules and regulations are minimum capital standards. Management believes that as of December 31, 2015, WMMRC satisfied such minimum capital standards and other applicable rules and regulations. Nevertheless, there can be no assurances of WMMRC\u2019s future ability to meet those standards, or as they may be revised.\nIn addition, WMMRC\u2019s business may be affected by legislative or regulatory reforms of the U.S. housing finance system, as well as the application of certain public or private sector programs designed to assist homeowners avoid foreclosure. In each case, these reforms and programs could change the economic behavior of either the mortgage insurance policyholders or the mortgage insurance companies to the detriment of WMMRC. Following the severe financial dislocations of 2008, new, sweeping rules and regulations were (and continue to be) promulgated by federal, state and local regulatory authorities, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d). Because WMMRC is currently operating its business in runoff mode, it has not, to date, needed to materially change any of its business practices in response to various regulatory initiatives, including the Dodd-Frank Act. Nevertheless, there can be no assurances that WMMRC will not be required to undertake changes to its business practices in the future in response to one or more regulatory initiatives.\nIn addition, WMMRC\u2019s reinsurance counterparties with active underwriting and other businesses have disclosed heightened regulatory oversight of their operations, including by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) and we cannot predict the extent to which such heightened scrutiny may affect how those counterparties do business with WMMRC. Likewise, neither WMMRC nor its counterparties can predict the full impact various regulatory initiatives currently pending or being considered may have on their respective businesses or operations.\nRisks Related to the Runoff Notes\nAny trading market that develops for the Runoff Notes may not be liquid; there are restrictions on transfers on the Second Lien Notes and the Runoff Notes are non-recourse.\nA liquid market for the Runoff Notes may not develop and we do not currently intend to list the Runoff Notes on any national securities exchange or to seek their quotation on any automated dealer quotation system. If any of the Runoff Notes are traded after their initial issuance, they may trade at a discount from the initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, and other factors, including general economic conditions and our financial condition, performance and prospects.\nIn addition, the market for non-investment grade debt securities has historically been subject to disruptions that have caused price volatility independent of the operating and financial performance of the issuers of these securities. It is possible that any market for the Runoff Notes will be subject to these kinds of disruptions. Accordingly, declines in the liquidity and market price of the Runoff Notes may occur independent of operating and financial performance. The Second Lien Notes include certain restrictions on accumulation of 4.75% or more of the aggregate principal amount of such notes thereby potentially and significantly limiting a liquid trading market for these notes.\nExcept in very limited circumstances, holders of the Runoff Notes will have no recourse against WMIH or its subsidiaries for payments due on the Runoff Notes other than against Runoff Proceeds, and there can be no assurance that the runoff proceeds and other recourse assets will be sufficient in amount to cause any unpaid interest and the outstanding principal amount of the Runoff Notes to be paid in full. The Runoff Notes will not be guaranteed by any current or future subsidiaries of WMIH, including WMMRC, and will be effectively subordinate to the liabilities of WMMRC.\nRisks Related to WMIH\u2019s Emergence from Bankruptcy\nDespite having emerged from bankruptcy, WMIH continues to be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with residual Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.\nWMI emerged from bankruptcy on the Effective Date and changed its name to WMI Holdings Corp. and subsequently changed its name to WMIH Corp. as part of its reincorporation in the State of Delaware. Because of the residual risks and uncertainties associated with Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, the ultimate impact of events that occurred during, or that may occur subsequent to, these proceedings will have on WMIH\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be accurately predicted or quantified. We cannot assure you that having been subject to bankruptcy protection will not adversely affect WMIH\u2019s operations going forward.\nBecause our historical consolidated financial statements reflect fresh start reporting adjustments following emergence from bankruptcy, as well as effects of the transactions contemplated by the Plan, financial information in our future financial statements will not be comparable to WMI\u2019s financial information prior to our emergence from bankruptcy.\nFollowing emergence from Chapter 11, we adopted fresh start reporting in accordance with ASC 852 (Reorganizations), pursuant to which the reorganization value of the entity was assigned to the entity\u2019s assets and liabilities in conformity with the procedures specified by ASC 805 (Business Combinations), which requires that the entity measure the identifiable assets and liabilities at their acquisition-date fair values. Adopting fresh start reporting resulted in a new reporting entity with no beginning retained earnings or deficit. In addition to the adoption of fresh start reporting, our post-emergence consolidated financial statements reflect effects of the transactions contemplated by the Plan. Thus, our future balance sheets and results of operations may not be entirely comparable in certain respects to balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations data for periods prior to the adoption of fresh start reporting and prior to accounting for the effects of the reorganization. Our historical financial information may not be indicative of future financial information.", "PERMNO": 81593, "SIC": 6162, "TIC": "COOP"}
